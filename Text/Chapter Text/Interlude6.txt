Greetings, milady! How're you doing?[N]
You need anything from me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't believe so.[N]
And I've been alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. If you change your[N]
mind, just say the word.[A][N]
I've nothing else going on.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Might've already hunted us enough[N]
meat for the next four weeks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's nothing, really. If Uncle Toby[N]
were here, it'd be enough for about[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Oh, seven hours, give-or-take?[A][N]
I'm used to hunting for the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
heightened appetite.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now I'm not sure what's[N]
more impressive here.[A][N]
You, or your uncle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! For sure. He's not really[N]
my uncle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] But he sure did[N]
teach me all I know.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder how he's doing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure he's well. He sounds[N]
like quite the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hearty man.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
That's not the half of it. Anyway,[N]
if you don't need me,[A] I'm gonna[N]
go polish this up.[A][N]
Found this bow while out hunting.[N]
It's such a beautiful thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Who'd just abandon it here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That IS a nice bow.[N]
You should treasure it.[A][N]
Show it to Toby sometime.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Thanks, milady.[A][X]

##I6KennethConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This doesn't make sense[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing iumportant, Blair. It's just[N]
bothering me that Holanis,[N]
Dalst's neighbor, is a place that[N]
I know so little about.[A][N]
A nation in shambles it may be[N]
but it's a nation nonetheless.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure a lot of nobility hardly[N]
knows of it.[A] Between the Archives[N]
and our travels, who knows?[A][N]
I may be more familiar with Holanis[N]
than Lord Arbordia![A][N]
Unless he frequents it without[N]
us knowing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Arbordia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He strikes me as one intimately[N]
familiar with this place.[A][N]
Don't know why. Frankly, I'm still[N]
wondering why he couldn't show up.[A][N]
You know, back in Couria.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Forgive my ramblings. I should[N]
take notes on our findings.[A][X]
##I6KennethSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you have there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I picked up this book on edible[N]
flora from the Archives.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry. I'll return it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Are you trying to[N]
throw a meal together?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It never hurts to vary one's palate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. Are you sure we can[N]
trust you with our food?[A][N]
Must I bring up the[N]
Coriander Incident?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Must you? If memory serves,[N]
that wasn't my fault.[A][N]
Natasia was the one who-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're guilty by association.[N]
And I don't think I'll ever forget.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
Truly a tragedy. Well, in any case,[N]
I can assure that won't happen.[A][N]
Please. You've done well thus far.[N]
I'll make you something nice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]When you put it like that,[N]
I guess I can't refuse.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Excellent. Now all I must do[N]

##I6ArtemisConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
Greetings, young lady. I had been[N]
meaning to ask you something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You knew I was from Holanis, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] correct. I guess we could've[N]
saved some trouble by asking you things.[A][N]
Lime where the army we fought  came from.[A][N]
Apologies. It's been a hectic string of[N]
events, and I overlooked that option.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can appreciate being busy. Besides,[N]
as it happens, I wouldn't be much help.[A][N]
The closest thing to an army Holanis[N]
should have is in Gohranos,[A] and it's[N]
hardly enough to support an invasion.[A][N]
Many of those at the archives were[N]
mercenary in nature.[A] Technically, you[N]
could argue all Gohranians are mercenary,[A][N]
but in this case, most of those at the[N]
archives were not familiar to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What does that mean? Is someone[N]
funding these mercenaries?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If only I knew. Gohranos should hardly[N]
have the coin for this kind of manpower.[A][N]
Perhaps there's another faction behind[N]
the scenes, setting this all up.[A][N]
But I've seen nothing of that in[N]
Gohranos.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can probably just continue[N]
our route as planned.[A][N]
The landmarks that're recorded[N]
in the Archives.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd agree. Of the three, I've only ever been to[N]
the Aqueduct, and only in passing.[A][N]
Can't say anything for sure of[N]
what actually happens there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, Artemis.[N]
This helped a lot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time. I'd rather not fight for[N]
a Holanis borne of the shadows.[A][X]

To bolster army morale, I thought[N]
perhaps I could regale us with a song.[A][N]
A perfect ballad came to me in a vision![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What kind of vision?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, I found some absolutely[N]
delectable berries,[A] and when I[N]
ate them,[A] the gods themselves came[N]
unto me.[A] They called me their most[N]
turpid vessel,[A] and spoke to me a[N]
song beyond mortal ken.[A][N]
And then, I woke up and found a stream[N]
of blood coming from my ears.[A][N]
