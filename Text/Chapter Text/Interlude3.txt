##I3_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Well, lassie... The winds're favorin'[N]
us. We're making good time to Opistia.[A][N]
I'd guess we're another four or five days[N]
out at most.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent![A][N][OpenMidRight]
...So, what be your plan, anyway?[N]
Draggin' Opistia into this war?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's... not quite how I'd phrase it.[A][N]
But I suppose you could see it that way.[A][N]
While the Opistians are normally a[N]
pacifistic nation,[A] they've historically[N]
stepped in during major conflicts.[A][N]
I'd call the Yg'stran invasion worthy[N]
of their consideration.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I suppose. Never been one for politics[N]
meself.[A] All o' my disputes are settled[N]
either with a sip o' ale or a good clubbin'.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...You could just call this war[N]
a large scale [OpenQuote]clubbin'.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It be more complex, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...We've nothin' better to do.[N]
I'd say give yer allies a holler.[A][N]
Dependin' on how the cards fall, these may be[N]
yer last peaceful moments for a long while.[A][N]
I'm sure everyone's got a lot on[N]
their minds.[A] That's what I do wit'[N]
me crew, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good idea, captain.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
(If I remember correctly, there's also[N]
some pirate-run shops on this boat.)[A][N]
(It wouldn't hurt to see what[N]
they have available.)[A][X]

##I3ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Ye good wit' yer mates, lass?[A][X]

##I3NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
Not quite yet, captain.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Aye. I get ya.[N]
Go then, and be merry.[A][X]

##I3ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
I believe so.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, then. Shall ye gaze o'er[N]
the vast horizon?[A][X]

##I3ArinConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Ah, Blair. How are you[N]
holding up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well, all things considered.[N]
It's been an exhausting road.[A][N]
But you'd know that.[N]
...Thanks for all of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm hardly the only reason[N]
you've made it this far.[A][N]
Don't undersell your own skills,[N]
both on and off the battlefield.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But that's the thing! You're a greater[N]
fighter than I could ever be,[A][N]
AND you've practically been my[N]
tactician![A] I owe everything[N]
up to this point to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
If you insist.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Anyway, if you haven't yet,[N]
you should check in on the others.[A][N]
As always, it's great to see you.[A][X]

##I3StefanConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Milady! Have you been keeping well?[N]
It's truly an honor to see you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I should be saying that to you, Stefan.[N]
You've been such a valuable ally![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, milady.[N]
But I'm just doing my duty.[A][N]
I know I can push myself further[N]
and serve us all the better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you say so. Just don't[N]
overdo it, please.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No promises, milady![A][N]
Anyway, I'm off to run four hundred[N]
laps around the deck of the ship![A][N]
A pleasure seeing you![A][X]

##I3PeggyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Well, hello there, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How have you been holding up, Peggy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hard to say. On one hand, I hate[N]
boats with every fibre of my being.[A][N]
On the other hand, at least this[N]
isn't a boring adventure.[A][N]
Good work, keeping things interesting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...You're welcome? I mean, you're part[N]
of why we've made it this far.[A][N]
You're why we ended up in Kionius[N]
in the first place.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're damn right. I'm the true hero here.[A][N]
...I was just joking there, but[N]
saying that actually felt real good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...I'm... glad to hear?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look out, world! You can't stop me now.[A][X]

##I3PeggyStrengthUp

##I3CassiusConvo
[OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Ah... The spray of the ocean.[N]
I could get used to this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Greetings, Cassius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wha- Ah! Lady Blair! Don't go[N]
sneakin' up on me like that.[A][N]
...So, what do ya need, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was just... checking in.[N]
I heard you mention the ocean spray?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right... Yeah, it'll sound somewhat[N]
silly, coming from me,[A] but it's[N]
refreshing.[A][N]
Maybe it's just cause I rarely[N]
experience it, but it's nice.[A][N]
...You ever think about that?[N]
I know, me thinking. Terrifying.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, you're right. It is...[N]
quite lovely.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]...Keep yourself well, milady.[N]
Opistus knows we need that.[A][N]
Meanwhile, I'll just...[N]
think a little more.[A][X]

##I3CassiusSkillUp
Cassius's skill[N]
increased by 1![A][X]

##I3RachaelConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
Shhh... It's alright, Tiamat...[N]
It's just a boat...[A][N]
Ah, apologies, milady. My pegasus...[N]
Tiamat, here. She's a little stressed.[A][N]
Fickle creatures, pegasi are.[A][N]
...You were alright with carrying[N]
both me and Cassius into Mevion,[N]
yet you can't handle a boat?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is there... anything I can do?[N]
...Tiamat, be a good pegasus...?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry. I'm sure this'll pass.[A][N]
Maybe I'll take her out flying[N]
for a little.[A] Would that cheer[N]
you up, girl?[A][N]
[CloseEyes]...Fine. I'll feed you.[A][N]
A bit early, but you[N]
serve us well.[A][N]
Anyway, thank you for checking[N]
in, milady. Good day.[A][X]
