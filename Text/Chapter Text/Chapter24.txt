##Ch24_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
Greetings, Girard. What did[N]
you wish to see me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're of keener mind than I.[N]
Have a look at this.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
What in the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a lot of notes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The results of my trip to[N]
Holanis.[A] The life's work[N]
of Lord Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you wish me to[N]
analyze them?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You pick up on things fast.[A][N]
See what's of worth within[N]
this pile.[A] Destroy the rest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Surely, if what I heard's[N]
accurate, this can't be all of it.[A][N]
Sinclair was a thorough man.[A][N]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] isn't enough for him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why I'm making more than[N]
one trip.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say, would you[N]
mind coming along?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. That'll simplify[N]
matters greatly.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is the best way to get[N]
back at him.[A][N]
Using what he did for the[N]
good of the Alliance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure is a way to look at it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If we're done here, I'd better[N]
be off. Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this document on top, anyway?[N]
[OpenQuote]The Histories of Holanis[CloseQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]A Report on Sagas Chronicled[N]
Within Zeimstadt[CloseQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C24IneubrenosDefeat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIneubrenos]
Oof[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well done, friend.[N]
My power is now yours.[A][N]
Use it to bring about[N]
the world you desire.[A][X]

##C24MasonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason]
Tremble before me, insurgents![A][N]
I am Mason, disciple[N]
of Lord Tarquin![A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] untouchable![A][X]

##C24MasonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
So much I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] haven't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
done[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
So many treasures[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
not mine[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C24MasonElcorianTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I must be off.[N]
I've much to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? You'd rather not watch[N]
the fireworks up close?[A][N]
See that traitor get what's[N]
coming to her?[A][N]
See Lord Tarquin avenged?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, whatever the case, I do[N]
quite appreciate this relic.[A][N]
With it, I shall soar through this[N]
darkness and break the traitors' ranks![A][N]
Those other creations shall do us[N]
much good too.[A] Almost makes one[N]
not need us real humans.[A][N]
Still, that blade you carry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] feel it.[A][N]
The power it holds.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It is but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a ceremonial[N]
implement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, and I'm the king of Holanis.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just saying. No reason to act[N]
like you're above all this.[A][N]
I've heard of your deeds. How your[N]
hands will never again be clean.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And I'd embrace that.[A][N]
But, hey. I'm not Girard's number one.[N]
I just know my place in the world.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Farewell. And good luck.[A][N]
Perform well, and more relics[N]
may be in your future.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sir, yes, sir.[A][X]

##C24_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
We're back in the Lowlands[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could go never seeing them[N]
for the rest of my life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I couldn't agree more.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't help but notice that[N]
there's been no bandit attacks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps Tarquin drove them off[N]
in the process of marching on us.[A][N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That might mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C24_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Reinforcements? He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] truly wasn't[N]
holding back.[A][N]
But we can't afford to be[N]
caught up in them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Especially since we don't know[N]
how many survived the last battle.[A][N]
If we're not careful, stragglers[N]
could catch up with us.[A][N]
Being pincered in this darkness[N]
could easily spell the end for us.[A][N]
I say our best move is to get out[N]
of here as quickly as possible,[A][N]
before that could ever become an issue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Everyone! Head west![N]
Regroup once we're beyond the dark![A][X]
