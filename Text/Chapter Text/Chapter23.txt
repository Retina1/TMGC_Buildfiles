[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You do not wish to back down.[N]
Unfortunate, young lady.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I can't back down. Not now,[N]
after learning what I know.[A][N]
Surely, you wouldn't stand[N]
for it either.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
I never pretended to[N]
understand Arbordia.[A][N]
I've always understood[N]
conflict and control,[A] and that[N]
has served me enough this far.[A][N]

but I'm not throwing away[N]
these years.[A][N]

earned my trust.[A][N]

fall, I won't deny it.[A][N]

Kenneth. Do you really think[N]

I wouldn't know. I'm not our[N]
tactician.[A] I'm not what you[N]
wanted out of me, I guess.[A][N]
Now. Let us pass. I'd rather[N]
not cut you down.[A][N]
But I will if I must.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N]

behind. I never have.[A][X]
