[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah, Girard. I was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] digging around,[N]
and I found some of your old notes.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
So you have. Forget that rubbish.[N]
'Twas but a fleeting dream.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
That's what I had thought, but the[N]
concept had stuck with me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And I had to refine it.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have a look.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You solved the problem?[N]
This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is amazing![A][N]
To think we can go beyond mere Simulacrums[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Creating genuine life from the departed.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not without its flaws.[N]
But it's a start.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
You undersell yourself, friend. With this,[N]
our glorious future is finally within reach.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] honor me, Girard. Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you[N]
quite sure this is right, though?[A][N]
There's some not quite noble implications[N]
to this whole[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] procedure.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
That there may be, but all shall be[N]
worth it. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'll see.[A][N]
And your name may perhaps go down[N]
in history.[A] The man who brought[N]
salvation unto mankind.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elcorian.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, Girard.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArbordia][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
This'll all be worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In any case, I must be off.[N]
There is much to be done.[A][X]
