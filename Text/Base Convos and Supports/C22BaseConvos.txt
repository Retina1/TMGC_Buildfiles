I must say[...] It's been a great[N]
comfort to have you here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad. There's not much[N]
I'd rather be doin'.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Are you sure?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Absolutely. I'll take exciting[N]
adventures over dull boredom.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Especially with you.[N]
[...]And all you guys.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd gladly take peace and[N]
stability for a while.[A][N]
Maybe once things settle down,[N]
I'll stay at your hometown a while.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That'd be quite an honor![A][N]
We'd have to prepare a whole[N]
feast to welcome a noble like you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? I look forward to that.[A][X]

##C22_Avan_Toddsworth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan]
How goeth the women, Todd?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not towards me, sadly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Have you tried talking?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course not! Again.[N]
Natural charm.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're talking to me right now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're[...] different.[N]
You genuinely tolerate me.[A][N]
[...]I hope.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Maybe that's what you need.[A][N]
Don't think of people as quick[N]
fun. Think of them as people.[A][N]
As friends.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not even the world's longest text[N]
could contain the list of my romances.[A][N]
You think I can juggle thinking[N]
of all them as friends?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Maybe narrow it down to[...] half a dozen.[N]
Six real friends. Real connections.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And then have a sevensome?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see your point.[A][N]
[...]Quality over quantity![A][N]
Nines and tens, here I come![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Maybe one day he'll actually listen.[A][X]

##C22_Horatio_Simone_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHoratio][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Hey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, chronicler.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Do you not recognize me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Why should I?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't play dumb. You're one[N]
of our projects.[A][N]
I believe you escaped years ago.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So what if I am?[N]
Think you can take me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I admit, I'm not quite sure[N]
if you can be contained.[A][N]
But worry not. I just wish[N]
to observe you from here on.[A][N]
See what you can do with a[N]
barely cobbled-together existence.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Subject's displaying contempt.[N]
I wonder why.[A][X]

##C22_Jeff_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff]
[...]Kid. What're you doin'?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hi, Mister Jeff! I'm just[N]
reading up on the basics.[A][N]
A good hero keeps himself[N]
well-practiced.[A][N]
How about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Just pacing. [...]How can[N]
you be so happy?[A][N]
This world sucks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I disagree. And even if it did,[N]
I'd like to make it better.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Making the world better[...][N]
What has it ever done for you?[A][N]
You're a kid with no parents.[N]
Sounds like the world's cruel.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, but[...] I've met so many[N]
amazing people lately.[A][N]
I've had the chance to put[N]
smiles on so many faces.[A][N]
To be a hero![A][N]
[...]I like to see that as the[N]
world saying sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Ever the optimist, I see.[N]
[...]I've had an easy life.[A][N]
[...]Why am I like this? I never[N]
earned this bitterness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[...] you sad, mister?[N]
Can I help?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Maybe you can.[A][X]

##C22_Kenneth_Natasia_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
Heya, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Natasia. [...]I've[...] been[N]
wondering something.[A][N]
Don't want to make you[...][N]
uncomfortable,[A] so if you[N]
want me to stop, tell me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What in the hell[N]
are you gonna ask?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You know I like to know things.[N]
Certainty[...] comforts me.[A][N]
So[...] I wish to know[...][N]
Did it ever[...] mean anything?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What[...] we had?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Actually[...] I guess it did.[A][N]
It helped me[...] find myself.[N]
Realize what I am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm glad to hear that.[N]
Let us never speak of it again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's ancient history now.[A][N]
We didn't know what we wanted,[N]
and we hardly tried to learn.[A][N]
But, hey. We're here now, beatin'[N]
up some chumps.[A][N]
So I'd say everything's coming[N]
up Natasia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wouldn't have expected this[N]
introspection out of you.[A][N]
You're right, though. All's well[N]
that ends well.[A][N]
And your current friendship's[N]
worth far more than[...][A][N]
whatever you'd call that[N]
fleeting infatuation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to hear you think[N]
so highly of me.[A][N]
[...]If you stop, I'll whack[N]
some sense into you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Well, then. Guess[N]
I'll have to keep on my toes.[A][X]

##C22_Stefan_Carbon_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCarbon][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan][OpenMidLeft]
Heya, Stefan. Any outlandish[N]
ideas today?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Outlandish? I mean,[N]
I've got ideas.[A][N]
But they're perfectly[N]
reasonable, friend![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Like the time you suggested[N]
I get a REALLY big bow,[A][N]
and shoot swords with it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I've since realized that's[N]
not the best idea.[A][N]
Lances would fly better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's wrong with some[N]
creativity?[A][N]
We're in life-or-death[N]
situations on the daily.[A][N]
Who knows when ingenuity[N]
will save the day?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't get me wrong. I like[N]
these ideas.[A] But they're[N]
all very impractical.[A][N]
And that's coming from me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps so. But I'd rather have one hundred[N]
absurd ideas than none at all.[A][N]
One of them's gotta be good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]When you put it like that,[N]
I guess it makes sense.[A][N]
Well, then. Hit me with[N]
some rapidfire.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Freezing the ground so we can[N]
slide along it faster.[A][N]
Taping together a sword, lance, and[N]
axe so we never face a bad matchup.[A][N]
[...]A spell that teleports chairs so[N]
Lady Blair can seize more easily![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Keep workshopping, pal.[A][X]

##C22_Josef_Athena_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJosef][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, Athena![N]
And greetings, Perseus![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hello, Josef. What's that[N]
you have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've collected our rationed leftovers[N]
and sorted out what nobody wants to eat.[A][N]
I feel Percy here deserves a bit of[N]
a treat after all he's done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]He doesn't seem too pleased[N]
looking at it.[A][N]
[...]I wouldn't be either,[A][N]
if my meal was a loaf of somewhat[N]
stale bread and some cold stew.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's just the first course.[N]
Look at this, pal.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Some fresh bear. Who knew our[N]
hunters were so skilled?[A][N]
[...]Are you excited now, friend?[A][N]
[...]Err[...] You're getting[...][N]
a little close.[A][N]
[...]Pal[...] The food's there[...][N]
I'm not your snack.[A][N]
[...]Help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course I am.[A][N]
[...]Woah![A][N][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]
That was quite a big bite, fella![N]
[...]Do you like it?[A][N]
Will you promise not to eat me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Have[...] you never seen a wyvern[N]
eat before? It's a spectacle.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That it is.[A][N]
By the by, I also cooked you[N]
up a bit of game.[A][N]
No need to tear into it[N]
as dramatically as him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thanks.[A][X]

##C22_Hyperius_Alexis_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis][OpenMidLeft]
Still with us, I see.[N]
You're something special.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm just doing my duty, sir![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even so, I'd bet a majority of[N]
recruits would've left by now.[A][N]
[...]Could hardly even blame them.[A][N]
But you're dedicated to our[N]
crown like few other.[A][N]
[...]Say. I'll need a successor[N]
someday. I'm getting old.[A][N]
I think you might have what[N]
it takes to take after my role.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-are[...] you sure? That'd[...][N]
be incredible![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. You're still very young,[N]
but I've an understanding of you.[A][N]
In any case, such a transition would[N]
happen once we're in peacetime.[A][N]
For now, just continue what you're[N]
doing. You're a boon to us all.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course, sir. I'll never[N]
stop fighting for us all.[A][X]
