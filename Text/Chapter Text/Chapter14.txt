...What is it now, Lazarus?[N]
You're hardly fit to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see... I had come to apologize.[N]
I have... several regrets.[A][N]
And I wish to fight for Yg'stra again.[N]
On that note, where is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Arkhinal? It has been sealed away.[N]
I'm not at liberty to disclose where.[A][N]
...Frankly, I wouldn't even if I could.[A][N]
...But if you're sincere about your[N]
desire to fight again...[A][N]
And you truly understand the error[N]
of your ways...[A] There may be[N]
a soldier's path ahead for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[N]
...Thank you for this chance.[A][N]
But, you do have one thing wrong.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And what would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My path... is not one of a soldier.[A][N]
It is one... of a conqueror.[N]
Of a living god.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I believe this is where we part ways.[A][X]

##C14ValdenDies
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
Gah... You... traitor...[A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
What, you call me a traitor? For what?[N]
For following my own path?[A][N]
For seeking glory? Is that not what[N]
everyone's here for? Glory and power?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There... is so much... you'll...[N]
never understand...[A] You are...[N]
truly... weak...[A][N][OpenRight]
Pah! Why do I listen to the[N]
ramblings of a dead man?[A][N][MoveRight]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Urgh![A][X]

##C14LazarusMoment
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
At last... This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest... How glorious.[A][N]
Just gotta think of a way to explain[N]
this to the emperor...[A] And then[N]
the world shall be mine.[A][N]
Perhaps I'd be able to take him[N]
on if I had Arkhinal,[A] but that bastard[N]
just had to get in my way one last time.[A][N]
...Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady... Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14OpenDeadValden
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So... the Dalstians did you in, Valden.[N]
Damn. I was hoping to do that myself.[A][N]
Alas. At least it makes my life all[N]
the simpler.[A] I'd say I feel bad,[N]
but I don't. At all.[A][N]
You were weak, Valden.[N]
That's why you died.[A][N]
As for me... Need I say more?[A][N]
I'm the strongest man in this[N]
entire fucking empire![A][N]
With the emperor as he is...[A][N]
There's nobody better suited[N]
to take this throne than I.[A][N][Event]
Ah... This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest. How glorious.[A][N]
Of course, that bastard just had to[N]
get in my way one last time.[A][N]
Hid Arkhinal away and took its[N]
location to the grave. Alas.[A][N]
Maybe I'll scour the palace for it[N]
later, and take all that's mine.[A][N]
...Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady... Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14SwitchHint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier4]
...Why am I standing here, again?[A][N]
Commander Valden told me sternly to[N]
not move from this spot,[A][N]
lest the enemy enable this switch that[N]
makes the throne sink into the floor.[A][N]
But why wouldn't he want that?[N]
...That just sounds cool.[A][N]
Alas. I'm not one to defy him.[N]
Hopefully he's doing alright.[A][X]

##nothroneha
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
What the... Did the throne just...[N]
disappear from under me?[A][N]
What sorcery is this!?[N]
Who built that into the palace?[A][N]
...No matter.[A][N]
If those Dalstians think they can[N]
take me down with their tricks...[A][N]
Well, I'll prove them dead wrong.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
...You.[A][N]
Treasure your last[N]
living moments.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
...[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
What, too scared to speak?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
...Hardly.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You are going to suffer[N]
for all that you've done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
You think you can[N]
kill me?[A] Hah![N]
Put on a good show, then.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I am the strongest[N]
man in Yg'stra![A][N]
If you wish to throw your[N]
life away, so be it.[A][X]

##C14LazarusDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Damn it... DAMN IT![N]
After EVERYTHING![A][N]
I am... the GOD...[N]
of this world...[A][N]
Without me... you[N]
all... are NOTHING![A][N]
Nothing... I...[N]
say...[A][X]
