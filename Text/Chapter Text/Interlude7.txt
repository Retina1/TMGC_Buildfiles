Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Consigned Rapier,[CloseQuote] Arbordia's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[...]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N]
[...]Wait. Never mind. I re-evaluated the[N]
look in your eyes.[A][N]
[...]So, how about our chicken?[A][N]
It's made with twice the chicken[N]
as our competitors![A][N]
That's two chicken per chicken![A][X]

##I7MerchantTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
[...]You look like you need power.[N]
[...]1500.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A scroll of power.[N]
1500 gold.[A][N]
Accept the deal.[A][X]

##I7NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
[...]Nevermind. You can't afford this.[N]
[...]Don't waste my time.[A][X]

##I7ScrollBuy
Purchase a powerful scroll?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I7ScrollPurchased
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You won't regret this.[A][X]

##I7ScrollDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd rather not.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Hmph. Reconsider.[A][X]

##I7WrapUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And that's where we left it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Prison camps.[A][N]
[...]And they fall on us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We don't have to do this.[N]
If you don't think it's wise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's suspicious. But we've proven[N]
our value to these nobles.[A][N]
So this might give us some sway.[A][N]
But they could also be seeking[N]
to rid of us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, if this is real[...][N]
We could save many people.[A][N]
[...]It's up to you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I know you're with me because[N]
you trust me. And my judgement.[A][N]
But is[...] Is it fair for me to[N]
decide our fate?[A] Decide if we[N]
live or die?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It isn't. But we choose[N]
to trust you anyway.[A][N]
And you've proven that you're[N]
not going to leave us behind.[A][N]
Time and time again.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I'll follow you to the end of[N]
the world.[A] And I'm certain[N]
the others feel the same.[A][N][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadChartreuse][ToggleSmile]
He's right, Viridian. We're[N]
all here because of you.[A][N]
[...]That rings even more true[N]
for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I know. If this can help people,[N]
we[...] We should take this chance.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I shall inform the others.[N]
You should get some rest.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Thanks.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]It'll all be fine.[N]
I know it will be.[A][X]

##I7House1Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Lord Arbordia's a strange one.[A][N]
I mean, he seems like a nice enough[N]
guy when he addresses the city.[A][N]
But I've heard rumors that he's[N]
rarely actually here.[A][N]
Sure, international politics[N]
are important[...][A][N]
But still. You'd think such a chivalrous[N]
statesman'd make time for his own state.[A][X]

##I7House2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
My brother's been living in Aercolyn[...][N]
I wonder how he's been handling.[A][N]
Supposedly their lord just upped[N]
and vanished a few months back.[A][N]
The daughter of that shady guy[N]
that got exiled years ago.[A][N]
[...]What was his name?[N]
Right. Sinclair.[A][N]
I wonder if he knows what's[N]
become of his land.[A][N]
Then again, I'm sure there's[N]
a chain of command in place.[A][N]
Otherwise, the world'd be one[N]
assassination away from anarchy.[A][X]

##I7House3Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
The academy's had a fresh wave[N]
of graduates lately.[A][N]
It's always reassuring to have[N]
our youth well-educated.[A][N]
I've heard Lord Neillstrom's been quite[N]
eager about this year's military branch.[A][N]
Supposedly, he's got an elite troop[N]
comprised of our best and brightest.[A][N]
It's comforting, knowing that we're[N]
protected by a man such as him.[A][X]

Well, here we are. Arbordia's[N]
finest cuisine.[A][N]
We've come a long way,[N]
so I say dig in.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]How much meat is that?[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadRift]
Nowhere near enough to stop me.[N]
We'll be[...] ordering more.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
I like this guy, kid.[A][N][OpenLeft]
And I like your dad, boss.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadEstelle]
A bountiful cornucopia[...] We're truly[N]
on top of the world.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadWilhelm]
If I knew this were coming, I would've[N]
up and left Elba Cor long ago.[A][N]
[...]Gods[...] Is that roasted salmon?[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadEliza]
Pass some to me, please![A][N][OpenFarRight]
This takes me back to my[N]
army days[...][A] All the strange[N]
personalities.[A][N]
It was[...] nice.[A][N]
I'm glad you have this,[N]
Viridian.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadRose]
The boss is great, Miss Boss's Mom![A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArgent]
If you ever wish to come with[N]
us, it's never too late.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's alright. It's also nice[N]
to settle down a while.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadDean]
Indeed. Once I've got a bit more[N]
coin, I gotta get back to my kids.[A][N]
I wonder how they're doin'.[A][N]
This group's almost like a[N]
second family, though.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse][CloseEyes]
It's truly something special.[N]
[...]Thank you, everyone.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadManfred]
Pass the champagne, friend.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadCallum]
I got you.[A][N][MoveRight]
Catch.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Excellent.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Let us raise a glass[N]
to us. To Viridian.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadDirk]
To the one who brought us[N]
all together![A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadFreddric]
[...][A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadViridian]
[...]Thank you, everyone.[A][N]
We couldn't have done this[N]
without all of us.[A][N]
And we're worth celebrating.[A][N]
To us![A][X]

[...]I'm glad you came.[A][N]
As mentioned, I've a cohort that[N]
wishes to speak with you.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadNeillstrom]
Greetings. I am Tarquin von Neillstrom.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[...] do you need of us?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll be straight with you.[A][N]
The Dalstian army's spread thin[N]
keeping order in Yg'stra.[A][N]
We've received rumors of a series[N]
of prison camps,[A] maintained by[N]
hostile Yg'stran remnants.[A][N]
Unfortunately, I cannot spare[N]
troops to investigate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So you'd like an outsider to.[A][N][OpenRight]
Precisely. We can negotiate further[N]
details later,[A] but I can promise[N]
handsome compensation for this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that all?[A][N]
No further details on these camps?[A][N][OpenRight]
Nothing that I can share.[N]
Perhaps once you've agreed.[A][N]
Of course, I understand the need[N]
to talk this over with your group.[A][N]
But know that this is your chance[N]
to leave a mark on Dalstian history.[A][N]
[...]Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]

Greetings. I am Tarquin von Neillstrom.[N]

I believe so. Near the pond.[N]
You were[...] contemplating.[A][N]
What do you need of us?[A][N][OpenRight]
You've already heard me ramble,[N]
so I'll be straight with you.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadViridian][OpenLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]See? I have good ideas.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Of course, Ethyl.[A][N]
On that note, the merc's[N]
here. What happenstance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Viridian, right? I don't believe[N]
we've met,[A] but I'm sure you've[N]
done jobs for my territory.[A][N]
Ciraweiss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[...] familiar.[A][N]
I was just exploring the[N]
city for a moment, Elcorian.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. Take your time.[A][N]
Lodging arrangements have been[N]
handled.[A] And I'm sure your[N]
party could use some rest.[A][N]
Again, you've exceeded my[N]
expectations.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Exceeded, you say?[A][N]
[...]Perhaps I'll have a job[N]
for you as well.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anyway, what were we talking[N]
about, Elcorian?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Something about stars falling.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Right. I guess it doesn't[N]
hurt if the merc hears.[A][N]
I've been researching a spell that[N]
harnesses power beyond compare.[A][N]
There's an[...] unstable version[N]
that's too much even for me,[A][N]
but I think I've finally worked[N]
out a more controlled casting.[A][N]
Perhaps once I refine it, we'll[N]
have the power to not need mercs.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Then again, it needs a mage[N]
of sublime ability to control it.[A][N]
There's more mercenaries than master[N]
anima users in the world.[A][N]
So you'll always have a place.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I'm glad.[A][X]

##I7TarquinConvo

[...]Apologies.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Nothing to apologize for.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah. Of course.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I suppose not, in a sense.[A][N]
Order has been[...] wrested from[N]
my grasp.[A] It makes one such[N]
as I feel almost[...] powerless.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Something[...] must be done.[N]
For[...] my nation's lives.[A][N]
[...]But I ought not to burden[N]

Apologies.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenRight][LoadJoan][OpenFarRight][LoadSonia][OpenMidLeft]
That armor[...] Are you[N]
from Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Perhaps. What's it to you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just observing.[A][N][OpenRight]
Forgive her. We're[...] envoys,[N]
of a sort.[A][N]
Meeting with Dalst to discuss[N]
terms for the future.[A][N]
Yg'stra's ought to regain its[N]
autonomy some day.[A][N]
Plus, we've uncovered some[...][N]
unsettling correspondance.[A][N]
It appears a late general of ours[N]
may have been in contact with Dalst.[A][N]
We're unsure of the finer details,[N]
but[...] This can't be ignored.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it can't. I wish I could[N]
say more than good luck,[A][N]
but sometimes that's all you can[N]
get with these elites.[A][N][OpenRight]
Isn't that the truth?[N]
Well, thanks anyway.[A][N]
The name's Joan, by the by.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Viridian. Just a mercenary.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

want to keep you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I'd say it must be.[N]
Good to see ya, kid.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's good to see you two, too.[N]
[...]Where're the others?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Off at some play, I believe.[N]
We'll make sure you see them.[A][N]
How's the mercenary company been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Great, actually. Some big shot noble[N]
invited us to the capital.[A][N]
Impressed him real good on a job.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ha! Nicely done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In fact, I've got this here[N]
for you guys.[A][N]
A cool[...] 4000 gold.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Holy smokes, kid! That's[...][N]
That's quite something![A][N][OpenLeft]
We've been working anyway,[N]
since we may as well do something[...][A][N]
But this'll ease our finances[N]
for quite a long time.[A][N]
[...]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anything for you.[A][N]
How much longer do you[N]
think you'll stay here?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hm[...] That's a hard one.[A][N]
This place is real nice[...][A][N]
But I'm sure we'll tire of[N]
it someday.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Indeed. But I think for now,[N]
some stability would be nice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. Anyway, I should[N]
probably get going.[A][N]
I'll meet back up with you[N]
and the others tonight, for sure.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're doing big things, kid.[N]
Make us proud.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! That's the plan, dad.[A][X]

##I7Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
I see you've got business to[N]
handle.[A] Everyone else is already[N]
heading towards the inn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll catch up. Feel free[N]
to go join them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nonsense. I'll stay by[N]
your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Understandable. I just wanted to[N]
find them before it got dark.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. Your family's currently[N]
living here, correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. I'm sure the open road'll call[N]
them again eventually,[A] but until[N]
that day, this is their home.[A][N]
Gonna throw some gold their way,[N]
since we've finally some to spare.[A][N]
While I'm out here, maybe I'll also[N]
restock the group's supplies.[A][N]
There's some interesting stores here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. This may also be a rare[N]
chance to take it easy for a while.[A][N]
Well, then. Let's find them.[A][X]

##I7Gold
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
Hm[...] 100000[...] If we[N]
set aside 3000 per person[...][A][N]
Besides me, of course.[N]
That's several weeks of pay.[A][N]
And then 4000 for the folks[...][A][N]
That'll leave us with[...][N]
60000 or so. That'll be good.[A][N]
[...]Fred'll be waiting for me[N]
once I've seen them.[A][N]
Let's not keep him waiting[N]
too horribly long.[A][X]

##I7TalkToYourFamilyGoober
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]What're you doing? Did you[N]
forget to greet your family?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's been a long week.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. Make sure[N]
you're resting well.[A][X]

##I7ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
I see you've spoken with your family.[N]
Are you finished here otherwise?[A][X]

##I7NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not quite, Fred.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Take your time.[A][X]

##I7ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. Shall we return to the inn?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. Wouldn't want to[N]
keep the others waiting.[A][N]
I presume your family will[N]
make an appearance?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Perhaps.[A][X]
