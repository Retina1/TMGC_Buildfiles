##I4_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Take your time, young lady.[A][N]
When you're ready, I'll be in[N]
the city's north.[A][N]
All the sundries you may need[N]
are near the river.[A][N]
And of course, don't be afraid to[N]
talk to the locals.[A][N]
They're a truly blessed people.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Archbishop.[N]
Again, thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's truly nothing.[N]
[...]May he guide your way.[A][X]

##I4ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Are you prepared, young lady?[A][X]

##I4NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir][OpenMidLeft]
Not yet. There's more to be done.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Understandable. Take all[N]
the time you need.[A][X]

##I4ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir][OpenMidLeft]
I'm ready.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent. You can go and rest up.[N]
We leave tomorrow, young lady.[A][N]
As stated, I shall lead troops to Elba Cor,[N]
while your group shall head to Yg'stra,[A][N]
and decisively strike at the capital.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you for your assistance, young lady.[N]
Together, our nations shall renew peace.[A][X]

##I4AthenaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
[...]Greetings. I am Athena.[N]
Do no harm.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No harm?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's my duty to guard this land.[N]
[...]As I said, do no harm.[A][N]
While our archbishop trusts you,[N]
I must maintain a level of skepticism.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Worry not. I shant act upon you[N]
unless you're deserving of it.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]In any case, you're preparing to[N]
invade Yg'stra, are you not?[A][N]
Perhaps us guards will be called[N]
upon to aid the offensive.[A][N]
If that comes to pass, may our[N]
paths cross.[A][X]

##I4DirkElizaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza]
Hello there![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hel-[A][N][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
lo[...][A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
Brother! What are you doing?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Who're you? What's your[N]
business with my sister?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I said hello first.[A][N]
I thought I recognized her style[N]
of dress from Dalst[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd be right. I'm[...][N]
from Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
See, brother? A friendly face![A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Of course. My apologies.[N]
The name's Dirk. This is Eliza.[A][N]
Forgive me if I'm a bit[...] harsh.[N]
We're all each other have.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We're from Ciraweiss, if you're wondering.[N]
[...]Why're we out here, brother?[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I could swear I explained it.[N]
Viridian needed us to come here.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Something about a supply pickup.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Right! I remember now.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Never change, sister.[A][X]

##I4LeilaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
Who're you? Wait[...][N]
Blue hair, noble clothing[...][A][N]
I've heard rumors of you[...][N]
Didn't Elba Cor send you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's-[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][Event]
[OpenMidLeft][...]correct.[A][N]
What was that about?[A][N][X]

##I4Cit1Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Whew[...] It's hot[N]
as hell today[...][A][N]
This tree here's a real[N]
blessing, I gotta say.[A][N]
Course, if it gets too hot,[N]
I could always jump in the river[...][A][N]
It's a bad idea, for sure.[N]
But it'd feel so good[...][A][N]
Opistus, you're truly a cruel creator.[N]
Putting me through this dilemma.[A][X]

##I4Cit2Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
As you probably heard, this area's[N]
merely the north of Opistinia.[A][N]
The whole city's quite the spectacle,[N]
I gotta say.[A] I'd estimate it'd take[N]
an entire day to walk its whole length.[A][N]
Little trick I've learned: If you're[N]
polite about it,[A] you can convince one[N]
of the guardsmen to give you a wyvern ride.[A][N]
Way faster than on foot, and the city's[N]
beautiful from up above.[A][N]
[...]You could make a whole business[N]
out of that, I'm sure.[A][N]
[...]Don't steal my idea. Please. I want money.[A][X]

##I4LeftTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
Armored knights these days[...] I just[N]
can't stand them![A] When I was a lass,[N]
they were slow. They got nowhere.[A][N]
They would roast in their armor if[N]
a mage so much as spat on them.[A][N]
And sure, that's still sort of the case.[N]
But they've made armor lighter![A][N]
A knight shouldn't be able to move as[N]
fast as a mercenary! That's just science![A][N]
And don't get me started on whatever they've[N]
been doing to sword-using armors[...][A][N]
They can stand up to spells like[N]
they're nothing![A] Sure, we've got[N]
our own sword armors that benefit[...][A][N]
But call me old school. I don't like it.[A][N]
All that is to say, take this tome,[N]
and smash armors like the old days.[A][X]

##I4CenterTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Mister Vladmir is the coolest![N]
I once saw him riding a dragon![A][N]
He saw me, and I asked real nice,[N]
and he let me feed him![A][N]
Apparently, his name is Wendell,[N]
and he's the coolest thing ever![A][N]
Lots of city guards have dragons.[N]
I wanna be one when I grow up![A][X]

##I4RightTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier4]
Pardon me, miss. We're searching for[N]
a criminal.[A] What'd they do?[A][N]
Well, have you seen any so-called[N]
[OpenQuote]spirit dust[CloseQuote] on your travels?[A][N]
According to the letter of the law,[N]
it's an illicit substance.[A][N]
And we have no idea how dangerous[N]
it may be to humans.[A][N]
Whoever created it is clearly[N]
a mastermind beyond compare.[A][N]
Not only is it potent and plentiful,[N]
but there's no trails leading back.[A][N]
Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised[N]
if they up and left the city by now.[A][N]
What's real bizarre, though?[A][N]
We've a sketch from someone who's[N]
supposedly seen the mastermind.[A][N]
Thing is, it appears to be a young girl.[N]
That can't be right, right?[A][N]
Anyway, if you happen to find any[N]
spirit dust, dispose of it.[A][N]
And if you happen upon a criminal mastermind,[N]
well[...] Tell me, please.[A] I want a promotion.[A][X]


##I4InnText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Bygone Zweihander,[CloseQuote] Opistinia's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
We're a cut above those other[N]
misplaced swords you've seen.[A][N]
After all, our meals are all blessed[N]
by an actual priest.[A] You can't[N]
beat food approved by Opistus![A][X]

##I4MerchantTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadTotallyNotSimone]
[...]Hold, please. You look like[N]
you might know a hero.[A][N]
A real young big shot, if you[N]
get what I'm saying.[A][N]
Well, for that kind of kid,[N]
I've got something marvelous.[A][N]
A tome that'll bring out the[N]
hero in a young mage.[A][N]
Asking price is 900 gold. Final offer.[A][X]

##I4NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadTotallyNotSimone]
Wait, you don't have enough?[N]
Shame. Maybe next time.[A][X]

##I4TomeBuy
Purchase a heroic tome?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I4TomePurchased
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadTotallyNotSimone][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, here you go![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent. Just know that this[N]
tome is a fickle thing.[A][N]
Not just anyone can use it.[A][N]
[...]Not my fault if you[N]
didn't pick up on that.[A][X]

##I4TomeDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadTotallyNotSimone][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I think I'm good.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I get it. This kind of power[N]
is a scary thing.[A][N]
I've nothing else, so if you change[N]
your mind, you may as well return.[A][X]

##I4LarondeTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
Hello, Lady Blair! Apologies for[N]
what happened in there.[A][N]
[...]I swear that's never happened[N]
before. But you handled it well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just glad we're all alright.[A][N]
And besides that, the trial was quite[N]
excellent.[A] I'm sure the experience will[N]
serve us well in Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Truly. I wish I could accompany you,[N]
but I've other business to attend to.[A][N]
You see[...] A few months ago,[N]
my younger sister went missing.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Just[...] disappeared into the night.[A][N]
I've been searching for her ever since.[A][N]
It's been[...] rough for our parents,[N]
and for me, to say the least.[A][N][OpenEyes]
On that note, if you ever happen to find[N]
a 15 year old girl, same hair color as I,[A][N]
about yea high[...] Her name is Rose.[N]
[CloseEyes][...]Tell her[...] Tell her that we miss her.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Sorry for hogging your time[N]
like that. You've much to prepare.[A][X]


##I4LiamTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLiam]
[...]Hey. You there. You look like[N]
you could use some extra muscle.[A][N]
Well, I happen to be a mercenary.[N]
Name's Liam, by the by.[A][N]
I've got a few jobs coming up soon,[N]
but after those, nothing.[A][N]
How'd you feel about hiring me?[A][N]
[...]Don't worry about the details.[N]
I'll find you in your hour of need.[A][N]
Hell, I won't even make you pay[N]
me in advance.[A] Course, if the[N]
day comes and you can't pay[...][A][N]
Well, that'd be interesting for sure.[N]
What do you say?[A][X]

##I4LiamChoice
Commit to hiring Liam?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I4LiamYes
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLiam][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're not going to regret this,[N]
young lady.[A] My boys and I will[N]
win you the day, some day.[A][N]
Just remember to keep some gold ready.[A][X]

##I4LiamNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLiam][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I'm not sure[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright, alright. Scary offer,[N]
I guess.[A] I'll be here if you[N]
happen to change your mind.[A][X]



##I4Buyington
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie3]
How did you[...] Did the authorities send you?[N]
[...]Nah. You're too young for that.[A][N]
Well[...] I've made a little[N]
somethin' spectacular.[A][N]
I'll sell the prototype[N]
to you for[...] 7776 gold.[A][N]
It's worth it.[A][X]

##I4BuyingtonBroke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie3]
[...]Never mind. You can't afford it, anyway.[N]
Come back if you scrape up some cash.[A][X]

##I4BuyingtonNo

No thanks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn. If you change your mind,[N]

I'll leave 'im outside for you.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadAddington][OpenMidRight]
I call him Addington. He's an automaton[N]
I've been working on.[A][N]
Right now[...] I think he's mastered differential[N]
calculus? Look. He's good with numbers.[A][N]
And crates.[A][N]
[...]I see your face.[A][N]
[...]No refunds.[A][X]
