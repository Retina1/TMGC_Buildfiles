Seize the[N]
aqueduct.[X]

##Ch19_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can hardly tell it now,[N]
but I believe we're in Holanis.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thought something feels off.[N]
The map says there should be a river here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Odd. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that[N]
the Aqueduct over there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Does it look old and worn down?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Somewhat. And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It also looks guarded.[N]
Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll have to approach and see.[N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's our plan, anyway?[A][N]
I doubt we can just politely ask if[N]
they're truly the ones behind the attack.[A][N]
In fact[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This whole place feels off.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Pardon me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
I don't recognize you. Did the[N]
boss send more researchers?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Forget it. I've got results to[N]
pore over.[A] Make sure to pull[N]
your weight.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Research? Is this place[N]
some manner of facility now?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Now that you mention it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I saw some similar devices to the[N]
ones set up here.[A] Back in lower[N]
Yg'stra, I believe.[A][N]
Perhaps the river's disappearance[N]
has something to do with them.[A][N]
In any case, it seems that this[N]
may not be what we were-[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Oh, for the love of-[N]
Michael was JUST here![A][N]
How'd he miss this bunch[N]
of trespassers?[A][N]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sortie up.[N]
We'll handle them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why's he get to hide[N]
in the control tower, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never mind that. Looks like[N]
we're not escaping without a fight.[A][N][OpenRight]
Even if this isn't their main force,[N]
it's still suspicious activity.[A][N]
We can't leave stones unturned.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It looks as if that control[N]
tower is sealed tight.[A][N]
If we can open it, we've a shot at[N]
their deepest secrets, I'd imagine.[A][N]
But we'll take this one step at a time.[A][N][OpenRight]
Certainly.[A] Everyone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Be careful. We're[N]
no longer fighting thieves.[A][N]
We've no idea what power Holanis has[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But we've come too far to stop now.[A][X]
//maybe break up into map events?

##Ch19_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
The Aqueduct is ours. As I guessed,[N]
it appears to lack what we seek.[A][N]
But I'm sure there's still much to[N]
gain from investigating their research.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. We'll rest and investigate for[N]
a short while.[A] And then, I believe we'd[N]
be off to our next closest target.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. That'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Zeimstadt Temple?[N]
If I remember correctly?[A][N]
I somehow doubt its value, but it's[N]
still worth looking into.[A][X]

##Ch19_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Find anything?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I know what they[N]
drained the river for.[A][N]
Have a look.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] bones?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's unlike almost anything I've ever seen.[N]
It almost looks like the remains of a dragon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So they dried up a river[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
for bones?[A] What's their goal?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm not quite sure. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If dragons are[N]
starting to appear[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This can't be a coincidence.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe Zeimstadt'll be more helpful[N]
than I once thought.[A][N]
From what I've read, scholars think that[N]
the temple may be linked to dragons.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What could this all mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I truly wish I knew. For now, all[N]
we can do is keep pushing forward.[A][X]

##_Ch19SysText
Seize the carpet tile in the northwest[N]
to cause the river to flow.[A][N]
This will also open up the southern[N]
tower and allow you to seize to win.[A][N]
Note that if any units are left in the[N]
riverbed, they will be stuck.[A][N]
This applies to both player and enemy[N]
units.[A] Be careful if you don't want[N]
half of your army swimming.[A][N]
Also, note that both Blair and Zeke[N]
have the ability to seize points.[A][N]
This will hold true for all future[N]
maps with a seize objective.[A][X]

##C19MichaelBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
My results are on the cusp[N]
of brilliance.[A][N]
Let us finally begin[N]
the experiment![A][X]

##C19MichaelHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're the escaped[N]
subject, are you not?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Indeed![A][N]
And you, my friend, shall be sent[N]
spiraling down into hell![A][N]
A fitting trade for the hell[N]
I've experienced, no?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
All we did was in the name[N]
of progress. Of the future.[A][N]
Sacrifice is necessary[N]
in all things.[A][N]
In any case, you must[N]
be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] euthanized.[A][X]

##C19MichaelDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a failing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] on my part[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
