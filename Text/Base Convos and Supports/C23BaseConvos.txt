[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry about your father, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What're you apologizing for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know we're probably going[N]
to have to strike him down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Okay. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anything else?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're fine with this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Obviously, I'd prefer not to.[N]
But we're long past that.[A][N]
If he shall bow to the whims of[N]
Arbordia,[A] then he has made an[N]
enemy of all of us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He's my responsibility.[A][N]
I csn understand you not wanting the[N]
two of us to fight.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if I am to succeed him,[N]
I must prove myself to him.[A][N]
Even if through his blood.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you're certain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The way I see it, blood's just that.[N]
Blood. Nothing special to it.[A][N]
You all have spent your life working[N]
to earn my trust. My respect.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He hasn't.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know not your feelings on[N]
your own father.[A][N]
But I hope you can understand mine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, Kenneth.[N]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't be. History will[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
look fondly on us.[A][X]
