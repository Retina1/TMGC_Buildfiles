Hey, boss. I've got a great idea![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No. I'm not letting you set[N]
my bow on fire again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This one's a good one, though![A][N]
You know my[...] talent?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Is this the same artistic[N]
talent adorning our fliers?[A][N]
[...]Gotta say, cute as that rose[N]
drawing you made is,[A][N]
I doubt it's turning many heads[N]
our way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]My[...] [OpenQuote]chemistry?[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm pretty sure that's a crime.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look, I'm just saying[...][N]
I have connections.[A][N]
If you want some exotic items[...][N]
I can help you guys out.[A][N]
Just talk to me out there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why can't you give the group[N]
valuable stuff before battle?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've learned many things in[N]
my fifteen years of life.[A][N]
Battle's a good distraction.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look, you know what I'm offering[N]
is worth the price.[A] That's why[N]
Opistia's got a bounty on me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I appreciate the offer.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Why'd I hire a criminal mastermind[N]
slash young child?[A][N]
Though[...] I suppose asking her about[N]
her [OpenQuote]exotic[CloseQuote] selection wouldn't hurt.[A][X]

Viridian[...] Do you remember[N]
this place?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]As a matter of fact, I do.[A][N]
It's[...] where we met, I believe.[A][N]
Funny how that works out.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How far back was it?[N]
One year? Two?[A][N]
Then again, I guess[N]
that's unimportant.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you still not[...] remember?[N]
Who you're supposed to be?[A][N][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I don't.[A][OpenEyes] But why should I?[N]
The life we've lived[...][A][N]
It's better than any past I could have.[N]
We're[...] doing good for this world.[A][N]
And I met all of you.[A][N]
While part of me wonders[N]
what life I once knew[...][A][N]
A larger part fears a life[N]
apart from the mercenaries.[A][N]
[...]Sorry if I was long-winded[N]
for a bit, there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] alright. It's how Fred[N]
and I feel too.[A][N]
We're making a difference for[N]
Ulmaron, together.[A][N]
That's always what we've fought[N]
for. A brighter tomorrow.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I couldn't agree more.[A][N]
Ever since that fateful day[N]
where Viridian and I[...][A][N]
Where we saved each other's lives.[A][N]
We swore we'd fight onward.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. It's[...] hard, fighting.[N]
But with someone to fight for[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
it's not so bad.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Well, that was far more reminiscing[N]
than I planned on.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's comforting to just let[N]
our thoughts go around.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Certainly. But we ought to[N]
make preparations.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Let us draft[N]
a battle plan.[A][X]
