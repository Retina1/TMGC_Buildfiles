##GuideBase
Base and Supports[X]

##GuideBaseDesc
During battle preparations,[N]
Base Conversations can be[N]
read. They provide a wealth[N]
of benefits, and a wealth of[N]
lore. Convos marked with !!![N]
grant concrete benefits,[N]
such as items and units.[N]
Convos marked with !![N]
contain valuable gameplay hints,[N]
such as mechanic overviews[N]
and map gimmicks.[N]
Convos marked with ![N]
are unimportant beyond[N]
providing some flavor[N]
and worldbuilding.[N]
Convos with no ! displayed[N]
will instead be formatted as[N]
[OpenQuote]___ and ___[CloseQuote].[N]
These are supports.[N]
Activating a support will[N]
increase that pair's support[N]
rank. Prior supports must have[N]
been activated earlier in[N]
the game (ex. you must have[N]
gotten Blair/Arin C to be able[N]
to activate Blair/Arin C+).[N]
Depending on the exact pair,[N]
supports can have up to 7[N]
different ranks-[N]
C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, and A.[N]
A unit can have 5 supports,[N]
with no limit on ranks.[N]
Support bonuses are determined[N]
on a pair-by-pair and[N]
rank-by-rank basis- affinity[N]
has no bearing anymore.[N]
Sometimes, it may also be[N]
possible to improve support[N]
rank via talk conversations.[X]
