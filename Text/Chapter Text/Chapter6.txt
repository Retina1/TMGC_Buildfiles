##Ch6_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadRachael][OpenFarRight][LoadCassius][OpenRight]
We should be nearing Elba Cor soon.[N]
Be on your guard.[A][N]
If I remember correctly, the bandits[N]
are plentiful around here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]This far north? Does Elba Cor[N]
not drive them off?[A][N]
[OpenRight]It's... complica-[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]The king's a wreck.[A][N]
[OpenRight]...Cassius. Think your next words[N]
over very carefully.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]...You're obviously familiar with[N]
the Mevion Revolution, right?[A][N]
Well, some Mevionese scum decided that[N]
revolution at home wasn't enough.[A][N]
The young prince... was assassinated.[N]
Didn't even leave the body behind.[A][N]
Strangely, the king himself was[N]
never targeted.[A] In any case, you can[N]
imagine how that'd effect the man.[A][N]
[OpenRight]...Indelicate wording aside,[N]
I'm inclined to agree.[A][N]
A man consumed by grief may not...[N]
always make the best decisions.[A][N]
Even twelve years later.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I...[CloseEyes] had no idea.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Unfortunate as it is, it's in the past.[A][N]
...I think I hear something.[A][N]
A moment, please.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]...The most tragic part of all of this[N]
may be that some people still hold out hope.[A][N]
After all... a body WAS never found.[N]
...Some think he's still alive, somewhere.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]...I used to think that, too...[N]
But sometimes...[A] I think it's less[N]
painful to just move on.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadRachael][OpenFarRight]...Sounds like our history lesson[N]
is over.[A][N]
[OpenRight]We've got bandits up ahead.[A][N]
I believe I also saw some Mevionese.[N]
Suppose you're still not that welcome.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Very well. I'm counting[N]
on you two.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Of course. I'm here to serve.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]Apologies for acting all doom[N]
and gloom earlier.[A][N]
...Ahem.[N]
It's Cassius's time to shine![A][X]

##Ch6_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadRachael][OpenFarRight][LoadCassius][OpenMidLeft]
Alright... We should be safe here.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Excellently done. You're quite[N]
skilled, I must say.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]How'd I do?[A][N]
[OpenRight]We're almost in Elba Cor now.[N]
I recommend we make haste-[A][N]
we have reason to believe Yg'stra's[N]
planning to invade us.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]First, Aercolyn, and now, Elba Cor...[A][N]
Why are they doing this?[N]
What more do they want?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Unfortunately, war has no easy answers.[A][N]
...Let's go. Don't wanna keep[N]
the king waiting.[A][X]

##Ch6_Ending_Dead_Cassius
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][OpenMidLeft]
We should be safe here.[N][CloseEyes]
...I'm sorry about Cassius.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]It's... unfortunate. But ultimately,[N]
his fate was his doing.[A][N]
We must carry onwards.[A][N]
After all, we have reason to believe[N]
Elba Cor is Yg'stra's next target.[A][N]
We'll want to make it back to the capital[N]
ahead of a possible invasion.[A][X]

##Ch6_Ending_Dead_Rachael
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius][OpenMidLeft]
We should be safe here.[N][CloseEyes]
...I'm sorry about Rachael.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]...It'll do us no good to dwell on her.[A][N]
She'd probably... be proud of dying[N]
for a cause like this.[A][N][OpenEyes]
...Let's go. Don't wanna keep[N]
the king waiting.[A][X]

##Ch6_Ending_Dead_Rachael_and_Cassius
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[CloseEyes]...I... must...[N]
keep... going...[A][N]
...Why... Why am I...[N]
doing... this...?[A][N]
[OpenEyes]...How... am I...[N]
the hope... of a nation...?[A][N]
I never... wanted this...[N]
I never... DESERVED this...[A][N]
[CloseEyes]...Onwards...[N]
I... must...[A][X]

##Ch6_NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1]
You know... I've got it pretty good.[A][N]
Border guarding's hardly a job when[N]
the bandits do the guarding for you.[A][N]
...Hey, it's a living. At least I'm[N]
not a bandit myself.[A] Anything[N]
beats guarding the eastern border.[A][N]
I've heard about Yg'stra.[A][N]
If they come for Mevion, they gotta[N]
get through the east first.[A][N]
Not my problem.[A] And, well, if it[N]
becomes my problem...[A][N]
Well...[N]
Well.[A][X]

##Ch6_MidHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Man... Life's just not going well.[N]
First the bandits... Now this...[A][N]
Oh, a traveler?[A][N]
Care to hear my tale of sorrow?[A][N]
I had finally gotten skilled with the blade,[N]
as to defend myself from these bandits.[A][N]
I felt it would be prudent to pick up[N]
a magical sword, as to keep myself safer.[A][N]
But ever since then... I've felt like my[N]
skills have plateaued.[A] Like this magical[N]
sword isn't making me a better swordsman.[A][N]
Take that to heart, I guess.[A][X]

##Ch6_SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
Are you here to save us from[N]
Amundsen's bandits?[A][N]
Really? Thank you so much![A][N]
Here's a little bit of free advice, then.[N]
His bandits are extremely stupid.[A][N]
That might just sound like an insult,[N]
but it's absolutely true![A][N]
He'll tell some brigands to loot, and then[N]
they'll get distracted by anything![A][N]
Even by some pegasus flying nearby.[A][N]
So, if you wanna serve the people,[N]
start by exploiting the dumb.[A][X]

##Ch6_NorthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid2]
Wow! Are you a real soldier? How cool![N]
Hey, wanna see this cool thing I found?[A][N]
Look! This powder's all white and shiny![N]
You'll never believe where I found it.[A][N]
Me and my friends were playing in the[N]
street, and we found a dark alley...[A][N]
And someone just left this lying around![A][N]
...You seem nice! I'll share some[N]
of it with you. Have a great day![A][X]

##Ch6_SouthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
You're lookin' mighty scrawny.[A][N]
How're you supposed to not fall over[N]
holding your weapons like that?[A][N]
Well, don't worry. I've got the thing[N]
for that right... here![A][N]
This ring'll bulk you up a bit.[A][N]
Maybe now a stiff breeze won't[N]
topple ya.[A] Oh, be careful, though.[N]
The extra bulk may make you hard to carry.[A][N]
True soldiers are self sufficient, though.[N]
You'll be fine.[A][X]

##C6AmundsenBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
The mountains or the swamps.[N]
Where would you rather die?[A][N]
Either way, you're gonna[N]
die in pain![A][X]

##C6AmundsenPeggyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
My... You're certainly[N]
something... fetching.[A][N]
A fine hostage,[N]
if nothing else.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
And you still seem to have[N]
two too many eyeballs.[A][N]
Come closer, and I'll fix[N]
that, you pinkly bastard![A][X]

##C6AmundsenButchBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
I recognize those colors...[N]
You're from Mevion![A][N]
Thought we had some unspoken[N]
agreement here![A][N]
We shoo off bordergoers,[N]
you look the other way![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Those days are behind me.[A][N]
You're a dangerous criminal,[N]
AND you're in our way.[A][N]
At least with any luck,[N]
you'll meet a swift end.[A][X]

##C6AmundsenDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
Well... then...[N]
Damn shame... for me...[A][N]
But what other...[N]
choice... was there...?[A][X]

##C6Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
This is our last chance![N]
Those Dalstians...[A][N]
They're hurtin' our deal with[N]
the border guards![A][N]
Bandits, raid the villages[N]
while you still can.[A][N]
Meanwhile, some cavalry should[N]
be coming to our aid soon-[A][N]
then there'll truly be no escape.[A][X]

##C6WarningHard
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
This is our last chance![N]
Those Dalstians...[A][N]
They're hurtin' our deal with[N]
the border guards![A][N]
Bandits, raid the villages[N]
while you still can.[A][N]
Meanwhile, some cavalry should[N]
be coming to our aid soon-[A][N]
then there'll truly be no escape.[A][N]
...And if they try coming close to me,[N]
they'll be in for a surprise![A][N]
Hear that, boys? On my leave,[N]
jump out of the ruins![A][X]
