Any last words for me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good luck, wherever you go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Any last words for me?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Stay safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's it?[A][CloseEyes] [...]One day, I'll[N]
find you again.[A][N]
And I'll[...] I'll prove[N]
myself.[A] I'll prove I[N]
never needed any of this.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
The world's safe, the prince[N]
is back[...][A] It's hard to[N]
truly believe what we've done.[A][N]
Whatever comes for Elba Cor,[N]
I'll be there.[A][N]
And I must thank you for being[N]
here, milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've done well, Alexis.[A][N]
Elba Cor should be proud to[N]
have knights like you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You flatter me, milady.[A][N]
Even so, I can't rest.[N]
There's work to be done![A][N]
Take care, milady![A][X]

##Epilogue_JeffElbaCor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hm. [...]Yeah. This'll be good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Jeff? What brings you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That Rachael lass. Thinks I might[N]
make a good intelligence agent.[A][N]
Or something of that sort.[A][N]
Not the proudest of my skills, but[N]
if she thinks they can do good,[A][N]
may as well get somethin' outta[N]
them in an honest fashion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sounds exciting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. Hopefully not too exciting.[A][N]
[...]You did good, kid. Not sure[N]
if that means much from me.[A][N]
But I say you did good.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I'm glad to hear you[N]
think so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. I'm glad you're glad.[A][N]
If you can change my miserable[N]
life, you can truly do anything.[A][X]

[...]Hyperius[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Ah! Milady! I was just[...][N]
thinking to myself.[A][N]
[...]Hyperius is gone.[A][N]
It's just[...] hard to see[N]
Elba Cor without him.[A][N]
[...]But that's why I'll keep[N]
working as hard as I ever have.[A][N]
I'll make him proud.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm sure you already have.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's no reason to slack.[A][N]
I'll[...] keep making him proud.[N]
With all I do for Elba Cor.[A][N]
[...]No need to worry about[N]
me, milady.[A] Thank you for[N]
your service to our land.[A][X]

##Epilogue_MikeyElbaCor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I didn't expect to see[N]
you in Elba Cor, Mikey![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Cassius was able to get me[N]
some connections.[A][N]
Apparently, he's related to[N]
some local restaurateur.[A][N]
So he got me a job here.[A][N]
I'll return to Yg'stra one[N]
day, of course.[A][N]
But I think this'll be[N]
good for me.[A][N]
See some new foods, see new[N]
sights[...] It'll be good.[A][N]
Come on by if you ever get[N]
the chance.[A] And, uh[...][A][N]
Thanks for not killing me[N]
back in Yg'stra?[A][N]
[...]That was[...] quite the[N]
awkward battle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, everything worked out.[A][N]
Good luck here, Mikey.[A][X]

##Epilogue_HyperiusAlexisElbaCor
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
The war may be over, Alexis.[A][N]
But now your real challenge[N]
begins.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'm prepared, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Prepared for what?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hyperius will be training me[N]
to succeed his post.[A][N]
I've[...] come so far under him.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Not just under me, young lady.[A][N]
Under your own ability, you've[N]
become someone fearsome.[A][N]
Someone who I know can stand[N]
up to Elba Cor's challenges.[A][N]
Even if the prince reshapes our[N]
nation,[A] it will still need[N]
well-trained guardians.[A][N]
And I have the utmost faith[N]
in your prowess.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's still hard to believe[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
But if you believe in me, sir,[N]
I know I can do it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good luck, Alexis. I know[N]
you'll do great things.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You too, milady![A][N][OpenLeft]
Take care, young lady.[A][N]
And thank you for guiding[N]
us all to victory.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ZekeElbaCor
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBrandl][OpenLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
[...]I know that might be[N]
disappointing, father.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It is your choice, Zeke.[A][N]
And perhaps the world is[N]
changing faster than I know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To think[...] Elba Cor will no[N]
longer have a crown.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Our travels have taught me[N]
something, Blair.[A][N]
I'm not worthy of this[N]
nation. Nobody is.[A][N]
At least, nobody alone.[A][N]
That's why I want to use my[N]
power to change things.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]It's funny talking about[N]
this to a noble.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Yeah.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Dalst went through a lot.[A][N]
Something familiar's what[N]
they need to stabilize.[A][N]
Perhaps one day, they too[N]
shall change.[A][N]
[...]Until then, I hope our[N]
relations stay strong.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
No need to talk so stuffily[N]
about that.[A] We'll always[N]
be friends, Zeke.[A][N]
US and our lands.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Then let us embrace this[N]
new Ulmaron together.[A][X]

live to witness this change.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To think[...] Elba Cor will no[N]

You're the only man I know[N]
who'd give this all up.[A][N]
[...]Not that I'm complainin',[N]
or anything.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It would only be fair for you[N]
and I to become equals, Cassius.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]It's funny talking about[N]

I trust you'll remain by[N]
my side as well, Cassius?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It almost wounds me that you'd[N]
think otherwise.[A][N]
But I'm here to stay by your side.[N]
Forever.[A] [...]Take care, milady.[A][X]

##Epilogue_CassiusElbaCor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
No rest for us heroes.[A][N]
Elba Cor's gonna be in[N]
one heck of a state.[A][N]
Still, beats fightin'[N]
and dyin'.[A] [...]Not to sound[N]
bitter or anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Trust me, I'm glad it's[N]
over more than anyone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The prince told me some of[N]
his ideas for the nation.[A][N]
Thinks I might have the[N]
charisma to be elected.[A][N]
Wild stuff, I know.[A][N]
But if I ever do somehow[N]
get high up in Elba Cor,[A][N]
well, I'm glad to know I've[N]
got a pal right to our south.[A][N]
Keep yourself well, milady.[A][X]

##Epilogue_RachaelElbaCor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you for guiding[N]
us well, milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And thank you for your[N]
service.[A] To Elba Cor[N]
and Aercolyn both.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is simply one's duty.[A][N]
One that I shall continue[N]
to perform.[A][N]
Even if Zeke steps down,[N]
Elba Cor needs its knights.[A][N]
We must remain ever vigilant.[N]
And so, I shall.[A][N]
Would be a shame to waste[N]
my life's training, really.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The new Elba Cor will be[N]
in good hands with you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can only hope.[A][N]
[...]May your road be safe,[N]
milady. Good day.[A][X]

##Epilogue_RachaelCassiusElbaCor
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRachael][OpenLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
Much as things may change,[N]
seems they'll stay the same.[A][N]
You and I, serving Elba Cor.[N]
Even if it's[...] changed.[A][N]
Become democratic.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]You say that as if that's[N]
a disappointment.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hardly. It's just[...] strange.[N]
Elba Cor without Zeke.[A][N]
Or the king.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
It'll have you, though.[N]
That's a plus.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If the two of you remain,[N]
Elba Cor will be in good hands.[A][N]
You two are[...] more important[N]
to Aercolyn than you know.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I suppose we DID bring you[N]
the king's word.[A][N]
I won't let that go to my[N]
head. Don't worry.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It was simply our duty.[A][N]
And now our duty is to[N]
better our land.[A][N]
That's yours, as well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

our duty to our fullest.[A][X]

##Epilogue_HyperiusElbaCor

It[...] is done.[A][N]
[...]I am proud to have[N]

And I'm proud to have fought[N]
alongside one of your renown.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Had I not embarked to rediscover[N]
our lost prince[...][A][N]
Who could say how this all would[N]
have turned out?[A][N]
[...]And now we find ourselves at[N]
another historical turning point.[A][N]
Zeke seeks to change Elba Cor[N]
forever.[A] If he wills it, I[N]
will guide him along that road.[A][N]
I cannot say for certain if this[N]
will better our land,[A][N]
but my faith in Prince Zeke is[N]
unshakeable and stout.[A][N]
He has more than proven his[N]
noble spirit.[A][N]
Of course, he'll need the help[N]
of all Ulmaron.[A] We must ensure[N]
a lasting peace.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That we must. And I will[N]
continue to fight for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. I wish you all[N]
the best, young lady.[A][X]
