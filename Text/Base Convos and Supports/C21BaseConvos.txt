[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heya, prince. I heard[N]
about what you saw.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is it wrong of me to pity[N]
those mercenaries?[A][N]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] chose this. Everyone who[N]
fights knows what they risk.[A][N]
But even so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
all died for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you afraid you'll[N]
die for nothing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The thought's crossed my mind.[A][N]
But it's more terrifying to[N]
live for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the purpose of my life?[A][N]
I'm a prince who knows nothing[N]
of his kingdom.[A][N]
Nothing of his people.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I have to do all this.[N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to prove myself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is this really the best way to[N]
show you'd make a good king?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. But it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the[N]
only way I know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If that's the way it is.[A][N]
I'll follow your judgement.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Take it easy, prince.[A][X]

Greetings, young one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How've you been, Archbishop?[N]
You're a great help to us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm quite well. Feels good to[N]
stretch my legs some.[A][N]
The world's a wonderful place, and[N]
it's truly great to see it.[A][N]
Maybe I'll take Wendell out here,[N]
someday.[A] He'd like exploring[N]
these mountains, I'm sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How has he been, by the way?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I recieved word that he's been[N]
feeling better.[A] Perhaps I'll[N]
see if anyone can fly him down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heh. The image of a graceful[N]
archbishop alot a dragon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's almost unimaginable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps. But our bond is a testament[N]
to mankind's understanding.[A][N]
He guides us to seek an understanding[N]
of all things and all beings.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]When you put it like that,[N]
that's quite remarkable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In any case, to ensure our reunion,[N]
we must guide our allies to success.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. We'll keep everyone safe.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you wish to talk?[N]
Or to waste my time?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I never liked you.[N]
But I respected you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Respected.[A] Past tense.[A][N]
You're a man stuck in the past.[N]
The whole kingdom's like you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's a worthy past.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What about it is worth fighting for?[A][N]
Nothing but the result of one man[N]
hundreds of years ago,[A][N]
picking up a crown and deciding[N]
he was destined to rule?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just gracefully take my[N]
compliment and go away.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

Guess who it is?[N]
That's right! Jake![A][N]
It's secret shop time![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why is there a shop here?[A][N]
Isn't it an abandoned fort-slash-top[N]
secret research site?[A] Who would[N]
even buy goods from it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Now's not the time to question[N]
the ludonarrative.[A][N]
Now's the time to give you[N]
a patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's tucked right near[N]
one of the back three cells[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's in a very cozy corner,[N]
guarded by a master of blades![A][N]
Well, blade, singular.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for the hint.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing, lassie![A][N]
I'd better be off, then.[N]
Gotta go meet with my twin.[A][N]
She's off in a far-off land.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I fought in[N]
a war there once.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey, this armor's not just[N]
for show, lassie.[A][N]
I make a pretty great cavalier.[A][N]
But that's enough of that.[A][N]
Good luck, and I'll see ya[N]
real soon with another hint![A][X]
