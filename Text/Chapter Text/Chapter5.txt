##Ch5_Rachael_Cassius
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Woah, there! Slow down,[N]
Rachael! Do you want me to fall?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Amusing as it'd be, I'd rather you[N]
not die. After all, imagine the paperwork.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're very funny.[A][N]
Look, have you ever held on for dear[N]
life to a creature that hates you-[A][N]
purely for being a dude!?[N]
...It's not very fun![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Complain later. I think I see them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]All I see is darkness and your back,[N]
but I'll trust ya.[A] Do we make our move?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...They appear to be embroiled[N]
in conflict. On the run, as well.[A][N]
It may be for the best to lay low.[A][N]
We wouldn't want to overwhelm them,[N]
get caught in the conflict,[A][N]
or especially be mistaken for a foe.[N]
We'll head to Kionius.[A][N]
I'd imagine that's their target.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]More flyin'? Can't we take[N]
ten minutes to stretch?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A][N]
(My king... Surely you could've sent[N]
someone besides Cassius...)[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Hey! I heard that![A][X]

##C5MitchellBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
You've come quite far.[N]
I applaud you.[A][N]
Unfortunately, you're about[N]
to die. Goodbye.[A][X]

##C5MitchellButchBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
Butch? What're you doing,[N]
raising your blade?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Unfortunately, an old...[N]
acquaintance, we'll say-[A][N]
asked for a favor.[A][N]
She asked I help guide the[N]
Dalstians to Kionius.[A][N]
Said they're a good bunch.[A][N]
And you know what? Maybe[N]
she's right.[A] Maybe our lives[N]
fighting them were meaningless.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
You'd throw out your pride[N]
on a whim like that?[A][N]
Perhaps I misread you.[A][N]
Well, much as I'd rather not do[N]
this, I have to kill you now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Luckily for you, you won't[N]
have to worry about that.[A][N][CloseEyes]
...I'll kill you first.[A][X]

##C5MitchellDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
I have... failed.[A][N]
Who'll... keep...[N]
us... safe... now...?[A][X]

##C5Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
What's our strategy...[A][N]
Their pursuers- Yg'stra-[N]
some of their footmen might arrive.[A][N]
Before then... Maybe deploy a few[N]
units to fight them.[A][N]
Not many, though- why risk my men[N]
on what Yg'stra's trying to do?[A][X]
