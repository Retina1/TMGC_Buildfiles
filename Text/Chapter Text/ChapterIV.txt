Alright, that's all of them.[N]
Get moving, everyone![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Where to, exactly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anywhere but here. We'll see[N]
if there's more settlements south.[A][N]
But if we stay here, we risk[N]
more of them attacking.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Who were they, anyway?[A][N]
Why would Holanians, few as they[N]
presumably are, attack us?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In fact, how WERE there[N]
that many Holanians?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can ponder that later.[N]
For now, we have to keep moving.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do you still fight?[N]
You know you cannot escape.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Who's there?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't you know?[A][N][ClearFace][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's you.[A][N]
You are walking into your death.[A][N]
And worse, you are leading them[N]
all into their deaths.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What are you talking about?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert]
Must you be so inept?[N]
Open your eyes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good.[A][N]
Is some girl you met once[N]
worth risking your lives?[A][N]
You have all you could ever want[N]
with this group,[A] and yet you'd[N]
risk it all for some nobody?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what we do. We fight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
for those who cannot.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert]
I'm amazed those morals haven't[N]
killed you yet.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't say they've truly[N]
saved a life, though.[A][N]
Real shame what happened[N]
to Reynard.[A][N]
After what we saw in him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you to say everything we've[N]
ever fought for has no value?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert]
What value is there in a life[N]
that can't save itself?[A][N]
We've only gotten this far because[N]
we're strong.[A] And hell, that's[N]
a stretch.[A][N]
It's more like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we're lucky.[A][N]
And that luck's almost run out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Begone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFreddric][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
Viridian! Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you alright?[N]
I thought I heard something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a bad dream.[A][N]
Where are we, again?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We ran into the depths of the night.[A][N]
We eventually found a safe place to[N]
make camp,[A] and you basically[N]
collapsed once your tent was up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Right. Apologies for that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's all alright. You've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
stressed, lately.[A][N]
Anyway, Argent and I have been[N]
cycling nightwatch duties.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you wish to talk?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] alright. I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
uneasy, I guess.[A][N]
I don't want to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
lose what we have.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nobody does.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm fine. Really.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you're sure. I should[N]
return to my station.[A][N]
Sleep well, please.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNeillstrom][OpenRight][LoadArbordia][OpenFarRight][LoadElcorian][OpenRight]
Tarquin. I trust Yg'stra's[N]
under control?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Of course.[A][N]
Most believed that the young lady[N]
had fallen,[A] and those who opposed[N]
have been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] dealt with.[A][N]
The mercenaries I hired were[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
unsatisfied, in the end.[A][N]
But they're not my problem anymore.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's quite unfortunate.[N]
They're really something.[A][N]
A shame our partnerships with[N]
them cannot continue.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That need not be the case.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do you imply?[A][N][OpenRight]
You and I are headed to Holanis.[N]
Ethyl's there too, if I recall.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see that look in your eyes again.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What are you planning?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'll see, friend.[A][N]
For now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Prepare the Yg'stran[N]
remnants under your control.[A][N]
I shall contact you again with[N]
orders to deploy them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that feasible?[A][N][OpenRight]
They see your strength. They'll follow it.[N]
And if not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] You have the power to bring[N]
them in line. To establish order.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. It will be done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
Now then. We'd better prepare, Elcorian.[N]
We're about to make history, after all.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Certainly.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For all these years, I knew you'd[N]
change the world one day.[A][N]
And that change will finally come.[A][N]
I knew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you were worth it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Girard?[A][N][OpenRight]
Apologies. Got lost in thought.[N]
Well, then. Onwards to Jraeyan.[A][X]

##V4DarkeningBegins
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're letting up?[A][N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We still can't stop.[N]
It's starting to get dark.[A][X]

##V4Hurry
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
We're running out of daylight here.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We need to end this.[A][X]

##V4GameOver
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
It's getting so dark[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We won't stand a chance now.[A][X]

//opening text has the request from blair and zeke arrive, lead into narration (questioning working for nobles again so soon, doubts fester as the group is in southern yg'stra/northern holanis)
//dream or vision of the end

##V4NorthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Some guy showed up here recently.[N]
Traded with us for some rare minerals.[A][N]
I don't get it, and I especially don't[N]
get what they gave us.[A][N]
You know what? If you're here[N]
and fightin' off thugs,[A][N]
you'll make better use of this.[A][X]

##V4SouthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Greetings. You caught me[N]
deep in recollection.[A][N]
You see, fifteen years ago this day,[N]
a child from this village[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
went missing. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not mine, mind you.[A][N]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It sticks with you.[N]
Nobody knows where she is.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder if you'll ever[N]
return, young Lirel.[A][N]
But that's enough sentimentality.[N]
You've come a long way.[A][N]
One of our explorers found this[N]
near Jraeyan.[A] No clue where it[N]
came from, but it seems[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] lucky.[A][X]

##V4_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've come quite a way. I'd[N]
say we make camp for the night.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I must say, this[N]
is quite[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unexpected.[A][N]
I figured most of Holanis would[N]
resemble the Lowlands[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But this is quite the[N]
remarkable landscape.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Looking at my map, I can't[N]
fully say what country we're in.[A][N]
Guess this is fairly remote.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yet there's still signs of life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
From what I've heard, eastern[N]
Holanian settlers are a rare,[A][N]
yet resilient thing.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel your family would[N]
be right at home here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure they would be.[A][X]

##V4_Opening4
[OpenLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you okay? I think I heard[N]
an arrow soaring by.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What in the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Who'd[N]
strike us here?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadDean]
Over there.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I recognize those colors.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're Holanians.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Why would-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can ponder that later. We[N]
need to fend them off first.[A][N]
I don't think we'll be safe[N]
until we've dealt with all of them.[A][N]
And if they're recklessly attacking[N]
us,[A] they might threaten those nearby[N]
settlers in the process.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. We need to[N]
be swift and decisive.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I appreciate the plannin',[N]
but I'd move quickly.[A][N]
The sun's goin' down, and if[N]
we don't fend 'em off fast,[A][N]
we'll be in for more than[N]
we could handle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone! Today, we fight[N]
for our survival![A][N]
Time is of the essence,[N]
but I know we can prevail![A][X]

##V4_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I still so[N]
shaken over this?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's like he says. It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
good to feel this way.[A][N]
I know I'm still human.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
Pardon me, Viridian. A messenger[N]
wishes to speak with us.[A][N]
She appears to bear the Elba[N]
Corian banner.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elba Cor? What do they[N]
want with us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've no idea.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, if she was able[N]
to track us down[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
She's probably worth talking to.[A][X]

##V4_Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMessenger]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]Blue haired girl from Couria -[N]
seeking assistance in Holanis.[A][N]
Proposal to sortie at Fort[N]
Jraeyan -[A] negotiate with[N]
messenger and send her back to us.[A][N]
We'll accept any price.[N]
Thank you.[CloseQuote][A][N]
That is what she wrote.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I believe I remember her.[A][N][OpenLeft]
As do I. Thank you.[A][N]
Might we discuss this before[N]
sending you with an answer?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. I shall be outside.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Guess our advertising[N]
finally paid off.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's enthusiatic.[A][N]
Were you not concerned about once[N]
again working for nobility, though?[A][N]
The way she carried herself,[A][N]
and now suddenly having these[N]
sorts of connections[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
She's clearly not an ordinary[N]
client by any means.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
True[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Plus, Fort Jraeyan's supposed to be[N]
in an abandoned part of Holanis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Why WOULD she hire a mercenary group[N]
when she's made it far south alone?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps she expects resistance.[N]
Perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Those attacks as we left Couria.[N]
Might they have something to do with this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So if we agree to this, we're[N]
knee deep in some conspiracy.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Again.[A][N]
But if we do nothing, who[N]
knows what may happen?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How do you mean? If we don't go,[N]
then she doesn't visit an old fort.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon me.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
Excuse me! Messenger! By chance,[N]
do you have any more details?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They didn't tell me much,[A][N]
but I overheard mumblings of[N]
artificial dragons in Holanis.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
changes things.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's many factors at play here.[A][N]
If nothing else, I think we need[N]
to confirm what's going on.[A][N]
If it's far too dangerous, we'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
pull out.[A] And convince her to[N]
get out of this, too.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps this is beyond us.[A][N]
But it's also beyond the thousands[N]
of lives a crisis could endanger.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm behind you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. I'll confirm with the[N]
others, and then we're southbound.[A][X]
