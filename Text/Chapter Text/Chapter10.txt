##Ch10_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin]
So, if I'm not mistaken,[N]
we're nearly to Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Quite fortunate that we haven't[N]
run into any more pirate trouble.[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed. With any luck, we'll arrive[N]
without incident,[A] and then from[N]
there, we can meet with the Arch-[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Bang!*[N]
*Crash!*[A][N][Event][OpenFarFarRight]
Cap'n! We've been struck![A][N]
Someone's shootin' us with[N]
explosive cannonballs![A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
What in the hell? Who'd be[N]
brainless enough ta fire on me?[A][N][OpenRight]
I think I see a ship over there[...][N]
Wait[...] Don't tell me[...][A][N]
That flag. How did Yg'stra find us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why are they here? This is very[N]
obviously not Elba Cor![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Blast[...] I can already feel her[N]
goin' down.[A] 'Twas nice knowin' ye,[N]
Tradewinds[...][A] No sense in cryin'[N]
over spilt ships, though.[A][N]
Gimme a moment, lass.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
What is he[...] Is that a torch?[A][N]
Don't tell me he's joining in[N]
on the destruction[...][A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
Aye, I'm not that mad.[N]
I was just signalin' another ship.[A][N]
When you're infamous as me, ye[N]
make some connections.[A][N]
Any pirate worth their spit'll[N]
gimme a hand, if need be.[A][N]
Lemme see what they're signalin'[N]
back at me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Bang!*[N]
*Crash!*[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Cap'n! We've been struck![N]
[...]Again![A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
Aye, I know. I hear the same[N]
cannons as you dolts.[A][N]
Anyway, we be in luck, lassie.[N]
I'm owed a favor by a certain crew.[A][N]
That boat over there'll get[N]
you outta here.[A][N]
It's a small vessel, and their[N]
navigator's somethin' else.[A][N]
Once ye get near 'em, they'll[N]
open up their deck.[A][N]
It's not gonna get any easier.[N]
Go and gather yer crew.[A][X]

##Ch10_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadJonas]
Sir! Their hull's been breached.[N]
Their vessel is taking on water.[A][N]
[...]It also appears that there's[N]
another vessel, further away.[A][N]
Perhaps an escape route?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Brilliant! I knew this[N]
would be a worthy diversion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I may, sir? [...]Why are[N]
we doing this, again?[A][N]
Surely Valden's orders are[N]
the word of the emperor.[A][N]
And as far as I know, you've[N]
been told not to partake in[...][A][N]
these so-called goose chases.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does that bastard think this a[N]
waste of time?[A] This young lord's[N]
been a thorn in mine -[A] in Yg'stra's[N]
side since this war's begun![A][N]
Once I take her down, they'll[N]
recognize my genius![A][N]
And if they disagree, well[...][A][N]
That's what this beaut's for.[N]
The Arkhinal.[A] The strongest axe,[N]
for the strongest man of all time.[A][N]
You're a smart man, Jonas.[N]
YOU know to make way for the strong.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of course, sir.[N]
My orders?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Take a position near the planks[N]
we've set up.[A] Charge their army[N]
as they attempt to escape.[A][N]
I've got some final preparations[N]
to make, and then this'll all end.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Why am I stuck under him?[A][N]
After this battle, I'm transferring[N]
to Valden's unit.[A] Sane man,[N]
AND Amara's in it.[A][N]
I wonder how she's been?[N]
Not the time, of course.[A][X]

##Ch10_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenFarFarRight]
*Bang!*[N]
*Crash!*[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Cap'n! We've been struck![N]
[...]You're probably tired of hearin' that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We ain't the time to think, lass![N]
Ye gotta get a move on. Now![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What about you? That man is[N]
unfathomably powerful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfathomable power, eh? That sounds[N]
like a challenge for me boys![A][N]
We'll fight 'em off.[N]
[...]And then regroup.[A][N]
But yer mission is too important[N]
to risk.[A] Ye gotta get to Opistia,[N]
and find a way to end this war.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Very well. Thank you, captain.[N]
I'm sure we'll see each other again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, yes. Get a move on, now![A][N]
I reckon there's not much time before[N]
even that tiny boat can escape.[A][N]
Just remember, my mate'll only drop[N]
the gangplank once you're near.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Of course.[N]
[...]Good luck.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well, boys. This may be it fer us.[N]
But we be proud men o' the sea.[A][N]
To go down swingin' against tyranny[...][N]
That's a glorious end, in my book.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]May yer fortunes be vast,[N]
young lassie.[A][X]

##Ch10_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
We've[...] just barely[...][N]
made it[...][A][N]
Where's[...] Cid[...] and his crew[...]?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
It appears[...] that they have fallen.[N]
They bought us time for our escape.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This[...] can't be[...][N]
Oh, gods[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
What[...] have I done?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
This was their choice.[A][N]
Without their sacrifice,[N]
we ALL would have died.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
You're[...] wrong[...][A][N]
There has[...] to have been[...][N]
another way[...][A][N]
Where[...] did we go wrong[...]?[N]
Tell me[...] TELL ME![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Try to rest. Please. It's been a[N]
trying day for all of us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][X]

##Ch10_Ending2
[OpenMidRight][LoadBriant][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
[...]And that is where the[N]
invasion stands.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]It also appears that Lazarus[N]
has gone missing. Again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The Elba Corian resistance is certainly[N]
great.[A] But given enough time, we will[N]
absolutely win the war of attrition.[A][N]
And then[...] Whatever your goal is,[N]
it can be realized. By your leave.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]It'll all be worth it[...][N]
This is[...] the only choice[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
For the future of Yg'stra[...][N]
For our survival[...][A][N]
I[...] must bow to the darkness.[A][X]

##Ch10_Sveltzalus_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSveltzalus]
[...][...][A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What exactly[...] are you supposed to be?[N]
You're just[...] a floating eye![A][N]
That can't be real[...] This doesn't[N]
make any sense![A] And yet it's[N]
clearly here in front of me.[A][N]
Well[...] Let's assume this is perfectly[N]
normal and nothing is wrong.[A][N]
Assume that people-sized eyes exist.[A][N]
It seems[...] friendly?[N]
Are you a friend, eye?[A][N][OpenRight][MoveRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I'll take that as a yes.[N]
So it seems to understand me.[A][N]
We're in quite a precarious situation,[N]
whatever your name is.[A][N]
Could you help us out?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft]
Wonderful! Though I guess I should[N]
give you some kind of name[...][A][N]
How about[...] Sveltzalus?[N]
It feels[...] right, I guess.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft]
Glad to hear! Thanks, Sveltzalus.[A][X]

##C10GameOverMessage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
That's it. Time to end this.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
No! It's[...] too late[...][N]
We can't[...] escape now[...][A][X]

##C10DeckLowering

Yar, in 'ere! Hurry up,[N]

##C10_CidDoesAFunny
[OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Aye[...] They made it.[N]
Good fer them.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But these bastards have made[N]
this whole thing personal.[A][N]
Took out me crew.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]You want a piece o' me,[N]
ye Yg'stran scum![A][N]
I'll take ye' all on![A][N]
Might take me down, but that'll[N]
be nothin' compared to what ye face![A][N][CloseEyes]
Besides, the girl's fine[...][N]
That's enough fer me.[A][N]
This be a hell o' a way to die.[A][N]
One that scum like me[...][N]
truly be deservin' of.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Safe travels, lass.[A][X]

##C10CidDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Well[...] Didn't see[...][N]

Young lass[...] Yer gonna[...][N]
be just[...] fine[...][A][CloseEyes][N]
This be[...] a glorious[...][N]
ending[...] fer me[...][A][X]

##C10LazarusCidBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
So, you must be Cid.[N]
Some kind of pirate king.[A][N]
Know that to me, you are[N]
nothing but an obstacle.[A][N]
A barricade between me[N]
and my vindication.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Aye? And what're ye gonna[N]
do about it?[A] It's me[N]
duty to protect the lass.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[OpenQuote]What're ye gonna do?[CloseQuote] Ha![N]
Do you really need to ask?[A][N][CloseEyes]
As I've said, you're in my way.[N]
[...]And now you're going to die.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Prepare for a miserable end![A][X]

##C10LazarusBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Ah[...] There she is.[N]
The lordling.[A][N]
The source of my shame.[A][N]
Your death shall be[N]
my absolution![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
You're nothing but[N]
a deranged lunatic![A][N]
Yg'stra's after Elba Cor,[N]
not me![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I'm not Yg'stra, now am I?[A][N]
All I am is one man, bound[N]
to change history.[A][N]
[...]You said I'm nothing[N]
but a lunatic?[A][N]
Perhaps you're right.[A][N]
You'll die clinging to[N]
your pathetic ideals,[A][N]
and I'll be alive. Perhaps[N]
a [OpenQuote]lunatic,[CloseQuote] but alive.[A][X]

##C10LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
No more words.[N]
Die.[A][X]

##C10LazarusSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]

Where'd they find this?[A][N]
[...]No matter. You're but[N]
a notch in my belt now.[A][X]

##C10LazarusDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Urgh! Damn it[...][N]

Kill them where they stand.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadJonas]
Did[...] Did Lazarus just[N]
retreat?[A] [...]What a[N]
coward.[A] Well, if he's out,[N]
so am I.[A] Here's to Valden[N]
hopefully doing me better.[A][X]

##C10_JonasDipsAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJonas]
[...]Enough of this. I made it[N]
this far.[A] Not throwing my[N]
life away like this.[A][N]
If I'm lucky, Lazarus falls[N]
in the sea, and life's good.[A][N]
[...]Valden'll understand.[A][X]

##C10_LazThreat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Their vessel's sunk, and they[N]
still think they can run?[A][N]
That's it. No more waiting[N]
around.[A] I don't care what[N]
the rest of you do.[A][N]
I'm charging. Time to end[N]
this right now.[A][N]
Fliers! Prepare your assault![A][N][X]
