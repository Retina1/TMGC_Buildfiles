Ho! Prince![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's up, Bechamel?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I thought it be worth mention[N]
that I grew up in these Lowlands.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, really? Interesting.[N]
How'd you end up a pirate?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, it be complicated. Me sis'[N]
and I wanted escape.[A][N]
It be called a hellscape fer[N]
good reason, mate.[A][N]
Anyhows, many years back, we found[N]
our lucky break:[A] a merchant[N]
caravan wit' a light load.[A][N]
Me an' 'er snuck aboard, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
She was caught.[A][N]
Thrown back into the hell[N]
of our homeland.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And they never noticed you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas, nay. I still wonder if[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
If I should've gone back.[A][N]
Well, it be too late fer regrets.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you have any useful information[N]
that might help our strategy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The Lowlands be terrible.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, Bechamel.[A][X]

##C17_Blair_Zeke_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Tell me about your time[N]
in Holanis, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Should this not wait?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can prepare for battle and[N]
talk at the same time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I grew up in a small village,[N]
somewhere in the east, I believe.[A][N]
When I say small, I mean several[N]
dozen people, at most.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They all knew who you were?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's correct. To my understanding,[N]
they had been sworn to silence.[A][N]
I like to think it didn't impact[N]
what they thought of me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder how they're doing.[N]
Money might be getting tight.[A][N]
If I remember correctly, one of the[N]
woodcutters mentioned a mercenary group.[A][N]
That'd be something, if we hired[N]
someone I've known for years.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. Now it's only fair[N]
for you to regale me.[A][N]
Spin me a tale, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, would you look at that?[N]
Time for the battle.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Wait! You're not getting out of[N]
this that easily![A][X]

##C17_Stefan_Kenneth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft]
Sir Kenneth! A word, if you will?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose I could spare[N]
a few words on you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Your father, Tarquin von Neillstrom[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He's a warrior beyond compare, no?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's what people say, and I'm[N]
inclined to agree.[A][N]
But why bring him up now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why not call upon him?[A][N]
Could he not singlehandedly do what[N]
it takes ten of us to match?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He's a busy man, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Too busy for his son?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The scoundrel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not the word I'd use, personally.[A][N]
In any case, even if he were free,[N]
I don't think I'd want the help.[A][N]
I'm me, and he's him. No need to[N]
draw me into comparisons.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't resent him. Far from it.[N]
He's a brilliant man in his own right.[A][N]
But I want to be more than just[N]
the son of a brilliant man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Forgive my prodding.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eh. I'm used to it from you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll take what I can get.[A][X]
