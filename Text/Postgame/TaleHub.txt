##TaleHubExplanation
Welcome to the Postgame![A][N]
Here, you can partake in a[N]
selection of Trial Maps.[A][N]
Each map gives you preset units[N]
with preset items and skills,[A][N]
in a scenario that either occurs[N]
before or after the main story.[A][N]
Note that for all of these maps,[N]
any death is a game over![A][N]
You'll need to be at the top of[N]
your game for the harder trials.[A][N]
To begin a map, interact with one[N]
of the units scattered in this hub.[A][N]
Grey units mark incomplete maps,[N]
while green units mark complete maps.[A][N]
Right now, there are ten trial maps[N]
available,[A] and if you complete all[N]
of them, a bonus map will unlock.[A][N]
By the way, if you ever lose your[N]
trial map save, don't fret.[A][N]
You'll have the choice to start in this[N]
hub when starting a new game now.[A][N]
Thank you for playing, and good luck[N]
uncovering the Tales of Ulmaron![A][X]
