[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think. It's been such[N]
a tiring road.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't disagree there. But it's[N]
as I've said before.[A][N]
I shall stand by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Couldn't you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be more[N]
than that?[A][N]
Your skills are unparalleled.[N]
Surely[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I leave you to seek glory?[N]
I'm content to be by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I know. I'm just afraid[N]
that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this'll never end.[A][N]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm leading all of us[N]
into some kind of oblivion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're doing as well as you can.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We trust you.[A][N]
That's why we're still here.[A][N]
You don't try to act as some flawless[N]
leader[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Someone incomparable.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you. And that earnestness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It comforts us all.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] struggled, sometimes, to[N]
affirm my purpose.[A][N]
But you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a great purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] needed that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Let's not dawdle.[N]
We've ruins to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, hopefully not ruin.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought that was funny.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never change.[A][X]

##C20_Cassius_Athena_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Hey, Athena. How's the view?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The view? On my wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. See anything interesting?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see a strange man[N]
asking pointless questions.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How bizarre. I don't see anything[N]
of the sort.[A] Guess a wyvern's-eye[N]
view is the way to go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you doing this on purpose?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A little absurdity never hurt anyone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that a yes?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How's the view on your horse?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Tolerable enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup.[A] Hey, not every question's[N]
gonna have a satisfying answer.[A][N]
That's the Cassius style.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. Still as strange[N]
a man as ever.[A][X]

##C20_Apollo_Charley_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Apollo. Might I ask something?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad you're here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
While this certainly isn't what[N]
I'd imagined I'd be doing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm always glad to give back[N]
to those who've helped me.[A][N]
And, isn't that what this is?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. Though, I'd say by[N]
now you've repayed any debt.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. But now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've friends here.[N]
And I can't abandon them.[A][N]
What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm not dissimilar.[A][N]
Nothing's tying me here besides[N]
a sense of connection, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, protecting those connections[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's reason enough to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what Opistus tells you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I take it from that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
you're not devout?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never was my thing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. But, yes. He teaches[N]
us to stand for our bonds.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't want to pressure,[N]
but if you'd ever like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can guide you through[N]
some readings.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll keep that in mind.[N]
Thanks for the offer.[A][N][X]

##C20_Bechamel_Hollandaise_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
Oi, brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
'ow've you been, Holly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
These're some strange fellas,[N]
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you've chosen well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Bit 'ard to rob, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Anyhoots[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I must say,[N]
ye've grown lots.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ain't that what I should say?[N]
You're still a baby to me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ignore the height lead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Arr. Careful who ye call small.[N]
I could chuck ye ten paces.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps if those ten paces were[N]
those of a tiny lizard.[A][N]
Ye wanna try me, brother?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I be good.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I cannae say it enough,[N]
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm glad yer back.[A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry fer leavin'.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're here now. That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nice.[A][X]

##C20_Flynn_Horatio_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Hello, chum! Your sword[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is it of[N]
the heavens, or of this earth?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]W-what?[A] It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a[N]
perfectly normal sword.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Humble, I see. Is your power[N]
then within you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I guess? I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I can[N]
perform alright no matter the sword[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, but friend! There's alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And then there's transcendent![A][N]
[Tact] and I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're transcendent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] your sword's name?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Prince Zeke suggested it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So he did.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a blade of darkness, and yet[N]
it transcends darkness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Quite something, eh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't know what that means.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's a nice blade.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Now that's what I like to hear![N]
It's the blade[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
The blade that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]B[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]ring an end[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
to this farce[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Apologies. Lost myself there.[N]
Well, best of luck, Flynn.[A][N]
May we both survive the day.[A][X]

##C20_Kenneth_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe you're not wrong, mister.[N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a good guy.[A][N]
Despite your dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm truly humbled.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do you use darkness?[N]
We're a force of good![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There's more subtlety to magic[N]
than just good or evil.[A][N]
That's why many, including I,[N]
prefer to call it elder magic.[A][N]
It's quite unfair to write it off[N]
as the product of madmen,[A][N]
when it is in fact a rich field[N]
about the essence of the world.[A][N]
Any magic can produce calamity if[N]
left unchecked.[A][N]
In fact, any THING can in general,[N]
if these ruins are any indication.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As you said, though. We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
the good guys.[A][N]
Nothing'll happen under our watch.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right, mister.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's fine. Now, then. Let's[N]
show them what we can do.[A][X]

##C20_Rachael_Jeff_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you satisfied?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean? Should[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Should I not ask that of you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Touche. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't get you.[A][N]
I'm a self-serving nuisance.[N]
So maybe I never will.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Don't you want more?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I am satisfied to serve my[N]
homeland with pride.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, though. That sounds[N]
antithetical to a knight.[A][N]
Pride[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's the self-serving[N]
shlock I can get behind.[A][N]
So why in the hell do knights[N]
fight for pride?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I guess if I were to rephrase it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's less my own pride[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And more pride for my homeland.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's there to be proud of? It's a[N]
bunch of land and buildings.[A][N]
All represented by whatever family was[N]
lucky enough to have [OpenQuote]royal blood.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you have no pride for Mevion?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nope. But that's my problem.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll never get you.[A][N]
But, hey. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I tried.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is there any reason you're[N]
less coarse today, by the by?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Honestly, who the hell knows.[N]
And who the hell cares.[A][X]

##C20_Artemis_Hollandaise_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHollandaise][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oi! Cyclops![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's an affectionate Lowland[N]
original nickname.[A][N]
Wear it wit' pride![A][N]
Anyways, what're you starin'[N]
into space for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thinking. These ruins are some of[N]
the only remains of old Holanis.[A][N]
Will[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Will Gohranian Holanis end[N]
up in ruins too, perhaps?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're a daft one. Why worry about[N]
the fall of a non-existent society?[A][N]
Perhaps actually start your society[N]
first, no?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It still bears thought, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look, when yer like me, only[N]
one thing bears thought.[A][N]
How'll I make it through the day.[N]
You could learn from that.[A][N]
No point in thinkin' of a future[N]
when yer gonna get chopped today.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The audacity of that woman.[N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see what she means.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We have to fight both[N]
for now and for tomorrow.[A][X]
