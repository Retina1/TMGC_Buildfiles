##_Ch14Seize
Seize the throne,[N]
and end this war.[X]

##C14TheChoice
Kill the emperor by[N]
your own hand?[N]
[Yes][X]

##HandlePulse
Something is within[N]
the depths, beckoning.[A][N]
Answer its call.[A][X]

##ObtainTheHandle
A small tomb lies beyond[N]
the open door.[A][N]
Though you wish not to disturb[N]
it, something catches your eye.[A][N]
...On the ground lies a long[N]
thin rod, like an axe's handle.[A][X]

##Arc1Ending
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The flames of war that had burned[N]
across Ulmaron,[A] just as quickly as[N]
they rose, have been doused.[A][N]
Emperor Briant's dying words ring[N]
clear as day in Blair's mind,[A][N]
but before she can dwell too long[N]
on what meaning they hold,[A][N]
she must return to Elba Cor[N]
and Dalst,[A] as to decide the[N]
fate of Yg'stra's lands.[A][N]
Of course, the echoes of darkness[N]
naught stay silent for long.[A][N]
But before any of that...[A][N]
Another story must be told.[N]
A story of a grand reunion.[A][N]
A story of a young man realizing[N]
his destiny. The story... of Zeke.[A][X]

##Ch14_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]It's time, Blair. Have you made[N]
your final preparations?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I have.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Everyone. Thank you for coming this far.[N]
Today, we bring an end to this war.[A][N]
I know this has been a long and painful[N]
journey, and I'm sorry.[A][N]
But hopefully, this is our[N]
final battle.[A][N]
I call upon you all to lend me[N]
your strength, and bring victory![A][X]

##Ch14_CharleyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
You're Blair, right? I feel like[N]
we might've met before.[A][N]
The name's Charley. I've joined[N]
up with Opistia to help you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad to hear that.[N]
I see you've got quite the large bow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, yes. It's certainly unwieldy,[N]
but its range is unmatched.[A][N]
Whatever you need done, I can[N]
handle for you.[A][X]

##Ch14_AthenaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
[...]So, we meet again after all.[N]
You were in the capital.[A][N]
I'm Athena, if you don't recall.[A][N]
The archbishop sent a few your way,[N]
and, well, here I am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good. I shall be off to battle now.[N]
Guide me well.[A][X]

##Ch14_Ending0
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
He's finally dead[...] That was[...][N]
for everyone he's murdered.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately, he's not our true target.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Of course. I'm sure the emperor's[N]
somewhere in this palace.[A][N]
We just need to keep searching.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Be cautious. By definition, the emperor[N]
is the strongest man in the country.[A][N]
Given how close this battle was, I fear[N]
to imagine what he's capable of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Still[...] We've come too[N]
far to come back now.[A][X]

##Ch14_Ending1
[OpenMidRight][LoadBriant]
[...]So, this is the end of Yg'stra[...][N]
What was everything I sacrificed?[A][N]
What was this war all for?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Valden[...] I'm sorry[...][A][N]
Lazarus[...] Where did you falter?[A][N]
It's all[...] so distant[...][A][X]

##Ch14_Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant]
[...]You've done well to make it[N]
this far, young lady.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I presume you'd be the emperor?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]That'd be correct[...][N]
Emperor Briant.[A][N]
Though I'm far from deserving[N]
of that title now[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Enough talk! Why did you invade Elba Cor?[N]
What do you have to gain from this?[A][N]
Where did you take the soldiers of Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Tell me[...] Why did you do all of this?[N]
Please[...] TELL ME![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. The truth mustn't[N]
perish with me.[A][N][OpenEyes]
We must start at the beginning of this[N]
sorrowful tale. Many moons back.[A][N]
It all began with a messenger from[N]
the shadows.[A] A figure clad in darkness,[N]
delivering me an ominous message.[A][N]
[...]An omen of destruction.[A][N]
I felt to[...] ignore it[...][A][N]
After all[...] No truth could[...][N]
possibly have existed[...] within those words[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Destruction?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It was[...] a small village. Where[N]
I grew up. Where I learned to fight.[A][N]
A message arrived, but by the time I[N]
was there[...] Nothing remained.[A][N]
Upon my return to the palace, more[N]
from the shadows accosted me.[A][N]
Except[...] What was I[...] possibly[...][N]
to do[...][A] Their words[...][A][N]
They had forced me to frame the village's[N]
destruction on Elba Cor[...][A][N]
and use it as a pretense to invade.[A][N]
[...]Valden thought it unusual, but[N]
Lazarus[...] He was jubilant.[A][N]
It's almost as if he wanted this[N]
war more than the shadows.[A][N]
[...]It is a secret Lazarus had hoped[N]
to take to the grave,[A][N]
but he is not of Yg'stra.[A][N]
He had come from afar to prove[N]
his might, and came up short.[A][N]
[...]I shall never fully understand[N]
that man.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]What[...] could anyone[N]
have to gain from this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know not[...] In any case, that is why[N]
the Dalstian negotiations ran dry.[A][N]
Those within the shadows lent us[N]
a fragment of their power[...][A][N]
You say that your soldiers vanished?[N]
[...]It's possible that power[...][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]And pray tell, who are these[N]
agents behind the scenes?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
You[...] don't know?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I am[...] sorry. In attempting to[N]
save my own nation,[A] I've become the ruin[N]
of the entire continent.[A][N]
Well[...] I've told all I can.[N]
There's but one thing left for you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've won this war. But your path[N]
forward lies upon my grave.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you cannot bring yourself[...][N]
I understand[...][A][N]
But it's[...] over for me[...][N]
I've nothing left in this world.[A][N]
My home[...] My generals[...][N]
My pride[...] All forsaken.[A][N]
You've still[...] got a path[...][N]
ahead of you. A land to save.[A][N]
But I've[...] said enough[...][N]
Please[...] make your decision.[A][X]

##Ch14_EndingKill
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Goodbye, emperor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So[...] That's your choice, then[...][A][N]
I'm glad[...] you've the will[...][N]
to carve[...] your own path.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Here I come.[A][X]

##Ch14_EndingKillDead
[OpenMidRight][LoadBriant]
[...]Glory[...] to[...][N]
Yg'stra[...][A][X]

##Ch14_EndingSpare
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I can't do it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I understand[...] Very well[...][N]
I suppose[...] it falls[...] to me[...][A][N]
I'm glad[...] to leave the world[...][N]
to one[...] kind as you[...][A][N][MoveMidRight]
Urgh![A][N]
Glory[...] to[...][N]
Yg'stra[...][A][X]

##Ch14_EndingFinal
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]It's finally over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This doesn't[...] feel right.[N]
What was this all for?[A][N]
And what do we do now?[A][N]
The emperor is dead, yet we've[N]
more questions than answers.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] troubling, to be sure.[N]
But we've more important things to do.[A][N]
With the end of a war comes much to rebuild.[N]
Both in our land, and here.[A][N]
I recommend we return to Elba Cor.[A][N]
It makes a convenient location for[N]
post-war talk, given the involved parties.[A][N]
I'll send out messengers to Opistia[N]
and Dalst.[A] As for you, I believe[N]
you ought to address the troops.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Of course. It's over, and that[...][N]
That's cause to celebrate, if only a bit.[A][X]

##C14PreScriptedBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
[...]What is it now, Lazarus?[N]
You're hardly fit to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[...] I had come to apologize.[N]
I have[...] several regrets.[A][N]
And I wish to fight for Yg'stra again.[N]
On that note, where is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Arkhinal? It has been sealed away.[N]
I'm not at liberty to disclose where.[A][N]
[...]Frankly, I wouldn't even if I could.[A][N]
[...]But if you're sincere about your[N]
desire to fight again[...][A][N]
And you truly understand the error[N]
of your ways[...][A] There may be[N]
a soldier's path ahead for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[N]
[...]Thank you for this chance.[A][N]
But, you do have one thing wrong.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And what would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My path[...] is not one of a soldier.[A][N]
It is one[...] of a conqueror.[N]
Of a living god.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I believe this is where we part ways.[A][X]

##C14ValdenDies
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
Gah[...] You[...] traitor[...][A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
What, you call me a traitor? For what?[N]
For following my own path?[A][N]
For seeking glory? Is that not what[N]
everyone's here for? Glory and power?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There[...] is so much[...] you'll[...][N]
never understand[...][A] You are[...][N]
truly[...] weak[...][A][N][OpenRight]
Pah! Why do I listen to the[N]
ramblings of a dead man?[A][N][MoveRight]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Urgh![A][X]

##C14LazarusMoment
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
At last[...] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest[...] How glorious.[A][N]
Just gotta think of a way to explain[N]
this to the emperor[...][A] And then[N]
the world shall be mine.[A][N]
Perhaps I'd be able to take him[N]
on if I had Arkhinal,[A] but that bastard[N]
just had to get in my way one last time.[A][N]
[...]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[...] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14OpenDeadValden
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So[...] the Dalstians did you in, Valden.[N]
Damn. I was hoping to do that myself.[A][N]
Alas. At least it makes my life all[N]
the simpler.[A] I'd say I feel bad,[N]
but I don't. At all.[A][N]
You were weak, Valden.[N]
That's why you died.[A][N]
As for me[...] Need I say more?[A][N]
I'm the strongest man in this[N]
entire fucking empire![A][N]
With the emperor as he is[...][A][N]
There's nobody better suited[N]
to take this throne than I.[A][N][Event]
Ah[...] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest. How glorious.[A][N]
Of course, that bastard just had to[N]
get in my way one last time.[A][N]
Hid Arkhinal away and took its[N]
location to the grave. Alas.[A][N]
Maybe I'll scour the palace for it[N]
later, and take all that's mine.[A][N]
[...]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[...] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14AthenaCharleyJoin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena]
[...]And here we are.[A][N]
I'd say this is above my pay grade,[N]
but, hey. At least it's exciting.[A][N]
Moreso than border-guarding.[A][N]
[...]You can let go of me now.[N]
We're here.[A][N][Event][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Apologies. Never've been the[N]
most[...] comfortable flier.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]If I may ask, why[N]
did you want to come along?[A][N]
Surely, you can do more personally[N]
fulfilling things than war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For a long time, I've felt like I've[N]
wandered without a purpose.[A][N]
This might be what I've been looking[N]
for all this time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright. Enough talking. The lady's[N]
party should be nearby.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. It's all up to us.[A][X]


##C14SwitchHint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier4]
[...]Why am I standing here, again?[A][N]
Commander Valden told me sternly to[N]
not move from this spot,[A][N]
lest the enemy enable this switch that[N]
makes the throne sink into the floor.[A][N]
But why wouldn't he want that?[N]
[...]That just sounds cool.[A][N]
Alas. I'm not one to defy him.[N]
Hopefully he's doing alright.[A][X]

##C14Spooky
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenFarFarRight][LoadElcorian]
Are you sure this is quite[N]
alright, Girard?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Relax. Nobody will see us from[N]
here, and even if someone does[...][A][N]
Well, we're more than capable of[N]
fending them off.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]Of course.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
So, it appears this war is coming[N]
to an end. I expected nothing less.[A][N]
Whether Aercolyn or our agent falls,[N]
Yg'stra shall be[...] dealt with.[A][N]
In any case, the plan must keep[N]
moving forward.[A] For the sake[N]
of the future.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[...][A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
No need to be so apprehensive.[A][N]
Come, now. We ought to be off[N]
back to our homeland.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]Apologies.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Don't worry about it, friend.[A][X]

##nothroneha
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
What the[...] Did the throne just[...][N]
disappear from under me?[A][N]
What sorcery is this!?[N]
Who built that into the palace?[A][N]
[...]No matter.[A][N]
If those Dalstians think they can[N]
take me down with their tricks[...][A][N]
Well, I'll prove them dead wrong.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[...]You.[A][N]
Treasure your last[N]
living moments.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
What, too scared to speak?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[...]Hardly.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You are going to suffer[N]
for all that you've done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
You think you can[N]
kill me?[A] Hah![N]
Put on a good show, then.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I am the strongest[N]
man in Yg'stra![A][N]
If you wish to throw your[N]
life away, so be it.[A][X]

##C14LazarusHilbertBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Mister Bad Guy! Prepare[N]
to meet your end![A][N]
It's time for Hilbert the Hero[N]
to start the justice![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][ToggleSmile]
[...]Who let this runt in?[N]
Who do you think you are?[A][N]
You truly think a kid like[N]
yourself can topple me?[A][N]
Well, I'll show you a thing[N]
about how the world works.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBechamelBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadBechamel]
Arr[...] Yer the one who killed[N]
the Cap'n.[A] Well, pal[...][A][N]
Ye should've finished the job[N]
wit' tha rest o' his crew.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[...]It's revenge you seek?[N]
You're one persistent barnacle.[A][N]
I killed your captain.[A][N]
What chance does a[N]
deckhand stand?[A][N]
[...]You said I should've[N]
finished the job?[A][N]
You're right. Perish.[A][X]

##C14LazarusAgnesBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadAgnes]
Yer the bastard who[N]
did Cap'n in[...][A][N]
I'll kill you for that![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
So, they didn't all die at[N]
his side that day.[A][N]
Very well. You'll see your[N]
[OpenQuote]captain[CloseQuote] soon enough, wench.[A][N]
Tell him Lazarus sent you[N]
to keep him company.[A][X]

##C14LazarusPeggyBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
I don't know who you are,[N]
but you're sure persistent.[A][N]
A real persnickety bastard.[A][N]
Lemme have a crack[N]
at your skull![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
A holy woman.[A][N]
I see your god has given you[N]
quite the unfounded confidence.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Well, tell him I sent you.[N]
And that he chose poorly.[A][X]

##C14LazarusDesmondBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
I've heard stories of you.[N]
General Lazarus of Yg'stra.[A][N]
A masterful combatant.[N]
And nothing else.[A][N]
You've not the heart of[N]
a true leader.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
What do you mean to say?[N]
Sheer power's gotten me far.[A][N]
You speak of the heart?[A][N]
Where'd heart get[N]
Aercolyn's army?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][ToggleSmile]
A [OpenQuote]pure heart[CloseQuote] isn't power.[N]
Bonds aren't power.[A][N]
Hell, tactics aren't power.[N]
You know what is power?[A][N]
Power. That's what makes[N]
me different from you.[A][N]
Your power's shackled to[N]
those around you.[A][N]
My power[...] is all me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond][ToggleSmile]
[...]You're wrong. And I'll[N]
prove it.[A][N]
This is for all you've[N]
done to Aercolyn.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Have at me, then.[A][X]

##C14LazarusKennethBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...]My father's spoken of you.[N]
Called you a menace.[A][N]
Unpredictable.[N]
And to give him credit[...][A][N]
He's absolutely right.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I'm almost flattered. Perhaps[N]
once I'm done here,[A][N]
I'll pay him a visit.[A][N]
First, though[...][N]
Prepare to die.[A][X]

##C14LazarusNatasiaBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
I bet underneath all that[N]
armor, you're a chump.[A][N]
Lemme crack it open and[N]
see what's inside![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I was about to say the[N]
same of your skull.[A][N]
I'm glad we're on the[N]
same page, child.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
[...]Oh, that's it.[N]
You're dead, pal.[A][X]

##C14LazarusSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[...]You'll make a fine mantlepiece.[N]
Something truly[...] special.[A][N]
A trophy of my conquests[N]
in this land.[A][N]
We're truly both outsiders.[N]
But that won't save you.[A][N]
Stand still, abomination.[N]
You're mine, now.[A][X]

##C14LazarusValdenBattle

Good riddance, Valden.[A][X]

This is for all the good men[N]

Well, Lazarus.[N]
You don't know me.[A][N]
But I know you.[N]
I never liked you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Well, I DON'T know you, and I[N]
can say I detest you.[A][N]
So I guess we're even.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Wrong. One of us is[N]
about to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
You're right.[A][N]
I shall whet my axe[N]
