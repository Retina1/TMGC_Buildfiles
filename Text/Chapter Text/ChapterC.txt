##Z3Note
Escape to the manor in the[N]
northwest corner of the map.[A][N]
Enemy brigands can attack it[N]
like a village -[A] if the manor[N]
is destroyed, it's game over.[A][X]

##_Z3Escape
Protect manor[N]
and escape.[X]

##Z3Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
We're here[...] Elba Cor.[N]
The land of your birth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's truly remarkable. Mountains[N]
as far as the eye can see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Anyway, there's a manor[N]
up ahead.[A] It's owned by[...] an[N]
old friend, we'll say.[A][N]
If we make it there, we're[N]
as good as done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's the hold up, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Let us proceed.[A][X]

##Z3Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
What was that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The Yg'strans[...] They're[...][N]
pulling back! Is[...] the war over?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If that's the case, why are[N]
some of them not retreating?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do they seriously intend to[N]
prolong this conflict?[A][N]
Clearly, this war has passed.[N]
What's driving them to fight?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I had to guess[...][N]
Maybe stubborn pride?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Whatever the case, keep[N]
your guard up.[A][N]
I also see bandits about.[N]
If they wreck that manor[...][A][N]
Well, it's all over for us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm not quite sure I follow,[N]
but very well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then. [...]Are you kidding me?[N]
See those colors over the horizon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Vaguely. If I see them right,[N]
that's[...] Mevion?[A][N]
What're they doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Seems to be a small group[...][N]
Likely just some opportunists.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]We'll stop them. It's my duty[N]
to protect my kingdom.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aptly put, prince. It's[N]
time to move out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Everyone![N]
This is it![A][N]
One final push, and[N]
I'll be back home![A][X]

##Z3Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
We've made it.[A][N]
It was a rough road,[N]
but we made it.[A][N]
Say, whose manor[N]
is this, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius]
It'd be[...] Count Marius's.[N]
I told you. Old friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But he's[...] He's dead now,[N]
correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'd be correct. Illness[N]
claimed him around two years ago.[A][N]
I've been keeping it maintained[N]
ever since he grew ill.[A][N]
That's actually when I started[N]
to unravel this mystery.[A][X]

##TwoYearsAgoLabel
Two years ago...[X]

##Z3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlashbackHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadMarius]
[...]I fear my time grows short,[N]
Hyperius. It is[...] truly a shame[...][A][N]
But at least with you around,[N]
I know any business'll be settled.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
About that, Marius. I know you've[N]
been sending somebody money.[A][N]
Notable sums, regularly,[N]
for the past ten years.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What of it?[N]
The prince is dead.[A][N]
It's merely a coincidence.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If that's the case, then who[N]
is it all for?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I'm sorry, Hyperius.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[...] have you done?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Only what[...] was needed for[N]
the future of the kingdom.[A][N]
When will you recognize[...][N]
that he's gone?[A][N]
I respect you, and it hurts[N]
to see you consumed like this.[A][N]
Before[...] Before my end[...][N]
Promise me something[...][A][N]
Promise that you'll[...] look[N]
towards the future[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Goodbye, Marius. It's been[...][N]
good catching up with you.[A][N]
Let's hope you're still here[N]
next time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Until the end, Hyperius.[A][X]

##Z3Ending3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I will never fully understand[N]
why he did what he did.[A][N]
I want to believe he thought he[N]
was protecting you[...][A][N]
But surely, there must have been[N]
a better way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's all in the past now.[N]
No need to get hung up on it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]You're right, your highness.[A][N]
In any case, a short rest here[N]
would do us all wonders.[A][N]
Afterwards, we shall proceed to[N]
the palace.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well, Hyperius.[N]
[...]Thank you. For all of this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just[...] doing my duty.[N]
Hardly praiseworthy.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]But, thanks.[A][X]

##Z3Ending4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrandl][OpenFarRight][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
Hyperius! Where on Ulmaron[N]
have you been?[A][N]
You had disappeared right as[N]
the invasion mounted[...][A][N]
Had me worried sick that[N]
some Yg'stran got to you![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Apologies, your majesty. I had[N]
business I was long planning.[A][N]
I at least trust that the knights[N]
did a suitable job in my absence?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, the war's over, and we're[N]
still standing.[A] Any man would[N]
call that admirable.[A][N]
Pray tell, what was this[N]
business of yours, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenRight][LoadZeke][Event]
[...]Father? Is[...][N]
Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
W-What matter[...] What kind of c-cruel[N]
apparation is this, H-Hyperius?[A][N]
Who i-is this impostor[N]
in f-front of me?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Unbelievable as it is, your[N]
majesty, it is no jest.[A][N]
It is your son. Ezekiel Johanes Courian.[N]
Alive and well.[A][N][OpenRight]
You must have many questions[...][N]
[...]More than I, at least.[A][N]
But I-I[...] I'm[...][A][N][CloseEyes][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
I'm[...] so glad[...][N]
to see you[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
I-It's really[...] you[...][N]
My[...] son[...] alive.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
I shall[...] leave you two.[N]
I ought to see off our allies.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Why not invite them to stay?[A][N]
We must thank them for their[N]
assistance,[A] and how better to[N]
do that than a grand feast?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Of course. Is that quite alright,[N]
your majesty?[N][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For the first time in a long time,[N]
Hyperius[...] All is quite alright.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Very well.[A][N][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]
([...]You'd be proud if you were[N]
still here, Marius.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadAlexis][OpenRight][LoadLeila][OpenLeft][LoadAvan][OpenFarLeft][LoadToddsworth]
So[...] Where's our reward?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Now's not the time, Todd.[A][N][OpenRight]
Honestly, I'm with Todd on this one.[N]
I wouldn't mind ducking and running.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Nonsense! You're all heroes now![A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadDamien]
Heroes? Huh. Not a bad deal.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]On second thought[...] People throw themselves[N]
at a good hero, right?[A][N]
Watch out, everyone.[N]
Toddsworth's getting some action.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadZacharias]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
In any case, I feel we might be[N]
stuck together a while longer.[A][N]
But, hey. I'm always down for[N]
an adventure with[...][A][N]
Well, we're not strangers, anymore.[N]
How about friends?[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadLeila]
I'll go as far as acquaintances.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
The Royal Acquaintances[...] I like that.[N]
Has a comfy feel to it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadHyperius]
Everyone.[A][N]
The king thanks you for your deeds.[A][N]
You're all invited to remain in the[N]
city for as long as you'd like.[A][N]
There will be a grand reception upon the[N]
return of our Dalstian allies.[A][N]
The kingdom[...] is in your debt.[A][X]

##Z3RecruitmentText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan]
For Opistus's sake, Todd.[A][N]
That's the fourteenth bar this month[N]
you've been banned from for life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
First of all, it's Toddsworth, not Todd.[N]
Second, can you blame me?[A][N]
That idiot was basically begging for[N]
me to punch him in the face![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure. Because he had the gall to ask[N]
you to stop flirting with his wife.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, that's fair. Not right of me[N]
to leave him out.[A][N]
But to think he'd still be mad after[N]
I pour my heart out to him![A][N]
I swear, everyone's the same.[N]
Absolutely terrible.[A][N]
Gods, I need a drink.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nope. We're getting you out of this town[N]
before you end up dead in a ditch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Rude.[A][X]

##Z3RecruitmentText2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenLeft][LoadAvan][OpenFarLeft]
Well, my dear Avan. Looks like[N]
we've got trouble on the road.[A][N][OpenLeft]
This[...] isn't great. I've no weapons,[N]
and you've no skill in the slightest.[A][N]
What are we to do?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon me. Are you two alright?[N]
You seem to be fleeing.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
We're good. Just some[...] local authorities.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Ignore him. We'd like some help.[N]
I'm Avan, and the fop is Todd.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Toddsworth![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright, then. Stay close to us.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. I've got experience[N]
with staves, and Todd, here[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'll serenade you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]That's a threat.[A][X]

##Z3NorthVillageText
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman3]
You're with the kingdom, right?[A][N]
[...]Brilliant! Our town's got a lovely[N]
treasure.[A] Problem is, nobody here[N]
can use it. Take it off our hands.[A][N]
I swear that it'll gouge Yg'strans[N]
real good![A][X]

##Z3NorthVillageToddText
[OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman3]
[...]Are you that scoundrel[N]
on all the wanted posters?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Uh[...] Nope! That guy's Toddsworth[N]
Toddington.[A] I'm[...] John. Sworth.[A][N]
Johnnington.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Johnsworth Johnnington. Right.[N]
Well, John[...][A] I'd run now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why? I'm a law abiding John.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure you are. Look, if it'll[N]
make you leave and never return[...][A][N]
Take this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's a lance. I can't damage[N]
my supple body with that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not my problem. Please leave.[A][X]

##Z3SouthVillageText
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan3]
What's the leading cause of death?[N]
Running out of health, of course![A][N]
Well, this sword here'll help you[N]
out with that.[A][N]
Just sucks away your foe's vitality[N]
in an instant.[A][N]
Is it ethical? [...]Probably not.[N]
But do your enemies deserve ethics?[A][N]
Absolutely not! That's why[N]
they're your enemies![A][X]

##Z3House1Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan6]
Have you been keeping yourself well?[N]
No, not you you.[A][N]
That you. The you reading this.[A][N]
Do you need a drink? A snack? A nap?[N]
Take care of yourself.[A][N]
This land isn't your entire life,[N]
you know. You deserve a break.[A][X]

##Z3House2Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman4]
It's truly hellish[...] Yg'stra refuses to[N]
believe the war's over[...][A][N]
Mevion's ransacking us[...][A][N]
And worst of all, I can't[N]
find my good silverware![A][N]
[...]Look, I spent seven months' salary[N]
on that cutlery.[A][N]
Losing it is worse than war.[N]
Trust me.[A][X]

##Z3House3Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan1]
I think some mercs passed by a bit ago.[N]
Seems they headed towards the capital.[A][N]
I'm sure now that the war's over,[N]
there'll be unrest.[A][N]
That's a job for a merc to handle.[A][N]
[...]But if you'll handle this for free,[N]
that's even better, of course![A][N]
[...]Keeping us safe should be its[N]
own reward, right?[A][X]

##Z3House4Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan2]
Death's a scary thing, youngster.[A][N]
But if there's any solace to be found[N]
within its cold embrace,[A][N]
it's that your friends get to[N]
keep your stuff.[A][N]
[...]What do you mean that's obvious?[A][N]
I've seen many places. You wouldn't[N]
believe how wasteful some people are.[A][X]

##Z3ParqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadParque]
What're you looking at?[N]
These're my scraps.[A][N]
I'm gonna be the new[N]

It's what my brothers[N]
would've wanted.[A][X]

##Z3ParqueZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadParque]
That hair[...] Are you[...][N]
No, that's impossible.[A][N]
You must be some manner[N]

Well, upstart impostor[...][N]
This is MY kingdom now![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Wrong. This is my kingdom.[N]
I shall end your terror.[A][X]

Grah[...] So this[...][N]

Damn it! The manor's fallen.[N]
[...]Looks like we're finished.[A][X]

##ArcZekeEnding
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The truth behind Prince Zeke's [OpenQuote]death[CloseQuote][N]
has been uncovered,[A] and Elba Cor[N]
can move ahead into the future.[A][N]
The fate of Yg'stra is still up[N]
in the air,[A] as are the many[N]
questions within Blair's mind,[A][N]
and inevitably, the struggle[N]
for Ulmaron must begin anew.[A][X]
