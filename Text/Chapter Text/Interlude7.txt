Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Consigned Rapier,[CloseQuote] Arbordia's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. Never mind. I re-evaluated the[N]
look in your eyes.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, how about our chicken?[A][N]
It's made with twice the chicken[N]
as our competitors![A][N]
That's two chicken per chicken![A][X]

Lord Arbordia's a strange one.[A][N]
I mean, he seems like a nice enough[N]
guy when he addresses the city.[A][N]
But I've heard rumors that he's[N]
rarely actually here.[A][N]
Sure, international politics[N]
are important[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But still. You'd think such a chivalrous[N]
statesman'd make time for his own state.[A][X]

My brother's been living in Aercolyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I wonder how he's been handling.[A][N]
Supposedly their lord just upped[N]
and vanished a few months back.[A][N]
The daughter of that shady guy[N]
that got exiled years ago.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What was his name?[N]
Right. Sinclair.[A][N]
I wonder if he knows what's[N]
become of his land.[A][N]
Then again, I'm sure there's[N]
a chain of command in place.[A][N]
Otherwise, the world'd be one[N]
assassination away from anarchy.[A][X]

The academy's had a fresh wave[N]
of graduates lately.[A][N]
It's always reassuring to have[N]
our youth well-educated.[A][N]
I've heard Lord Neillstrom's been quite[N]
eager about this year's military branch.[A][N]
Supposedly, he's got an elite troop[N]
comprised of our best and brightest.[A][N]
It's comforting, knowing that we're[N]
protected by a man such as him.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad you came.[A][N]
As mentioned, I've a cohort that[N]
wishes to speak with you.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadNeillstrom]
Greetings. I am Tarquin von Neillstrom.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do you need of us?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll be straight with you.[A][N]
The Dalstian army's spread thin[N]
keeping order in Yg'stra.[A][N]
We've recieved rumors of a series[N]
of prison camps,[A] maintained by[N]
hostile Yg'stran remnants.[A][N]
Unfortunately, I cannot spare[N]
troops to investigate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So you'd like an outsider to.[A][N][OpenRight]
Precisely. We can negotiate further[N]
details later,[A] but I can promise[N]
handsome compensation for this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that all?[A][N]
No further details on these camps?[A][N][OpenRight]
Nothing that I can share.[N]
Perhaps once you've agreed.[A][N]
Of course, I understand the need[N]
to talk this over with your group.[A][N]
But know that this is your chance[N]
to leave a mark on Dalstian history.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thank you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

Greetings. I am Tarquin von Neillstrom.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have we met before?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I believe so. Near the pond.[N]
You were[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] contemplating.[A][N]
What do you need of us?[A][N][OpenRight]
You've already heard me ramble,[N]
so I'll be straight with you.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]See? I have good ideas.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, Ethyl.[A][N]
On that note, the merc's[N]
here. What happenstance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Viridian, right? I don't believe[N]
we've met,[A] but I'm sure you've[N]
done jobs for my territory.[A][N]
Ciraweiss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] familiar.[A][N]
I was just exploring the[N]
city for a moment, Elcorian.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. Take your time.[A][N]
Lodging arrangements have been[N]
handled.[A] And I'm sure your[N]
party could use some rest.[A][N]
Again, you've exceeded my[N]
expectations.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Exceeded, you say?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhsps I'll have a job[N]
for you as well.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anyway, what were we talking[N]
about, Elcorian?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Something about stars falling.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right. I guess it doesn't[N]
hurt if the merc hears.[A][N]
I've been researching a spell that[N]
harnesses power beyond compare.[A][N]
There's an[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unstable version[N]
that's too much even for me,[A][N]
but I think I've finally worked[N]
out a more controlled casting.[A][N]
Perhaps once I refine it, we'll[N]
have the power to not need mercs.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then again, it needs a mage[N]
of sublime ability to control it.[A][N]
There's more mercenaries than master[N]
anima users in the world.[A][N]
So you'll always have a place.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad.[A][X]

Are you lost, perchance?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just looking around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Nothing to apologize for.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah. Of course.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose not, in a sense.[A][N]
Order has been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wrested from[N]
my grasp.[A] It makes one such[N]
as I feel almost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] powerless.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Something[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] must be done.[N]
For[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] my nation's lives.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I ought not to burden[N]
a stranger with this all.[A][N]
Apologies.[A][X]

from Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps. What's it to you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just observing.[A][N][OpenRight]
Forgive her. We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] envoys,[N]
of a sort.[A][N]
Meeting with Dalst to discuss[N]
terms for the future.[A][N]
Yg'stra's ought to regain its[N]
autonomy some day.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd agree. The actions of one man[N]
cannot keep a nation shackled.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well put, stranger.[A][N]
The name's Joan, by the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Viridian. Just a mercenary.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that all? We wouldn't[N]
want to keep you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I'd say it must be.[N]
Good to see ya, kid.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's good to see you two, too.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where're the others?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Off at some play, I believe.[N]
We'll make sure you see them.[A][N]
How's the mercenary company been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Great, actually. Some big shot noble[N]
invited us to the capital.[A][N]
Impressed him real good on a job.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ha! Nicely done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In fact, I've got this here[N]
for you guys.[A][N]
A cool[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] 4000 gold.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Holy smokes, kid! That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's quite something![A][N][OpenLeft]
We've been working anyway,[N]
since we may as well do something[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But this'll ease our finances[N]
for quite a long time.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anything for you.[A][N]
How much longer do you[N]
think you'll stay here?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's a hard one.[A][N]
This place is real nice[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I'm sure we'll tire of[N]
it someday.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Indeed. But I think for now,[N]
some stability would be nice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. Anyway, I should[N]
probably get going.[A][N]
I'll meet back up with you[N]
and the others tonight, for sure.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're doing big things, kid.[N]
Make us proud.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! That's the plan, dad.[A][X]

I'll catch up. Feel free[N]
to go join them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nonsense. I'll stay by[N]
your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Understandable. I just wanted to[N]
find them before it got dark.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. Your family's currently[N]
living here, correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. I'm sure the open road'll call[N]
them again eventually,[A] but until[N]
that day, this is their home.[A][N]
Gonna throw some gold their way,[N]
since we've finally some to spare.[A][N]
While I'm out here, maybe I'll also[N]
restock the group's supplies.[A][N]
There's some interesting stores here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. This may also be a rare[N]
chance to take it easy for a while.[A][N]
Well, then. Let's find them.[A][X]

set aside 3000 per person[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Besides me, of course.[N]
That's several weeks of pay.[A][N]
And then 4000 for the folks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That'll leave us with[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
60000 or so. That'll be good.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fred'll be waiting for me[N]
once I've seen them.[A][N]
Let's not keep him waiting[N]
too horribly long.[A][X]

I presume your family will[N]
make an appearance?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
