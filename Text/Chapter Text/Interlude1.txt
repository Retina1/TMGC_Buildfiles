##I1_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Well, here we are. Kionius,[N]
the capital of Mevion.[A][N]
Thankfully, Peggy was right.[N]
We don't really stick out anymore.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What do we do, now that we're here?[N]
We can't stay here forever.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's where we run into problems.[A][N]
We're foreigners, so I'm not even clear[N]
on governmental procedure here,[A][N]
and assuming we get an audience with the[N]
parliament,[A] there's no guarantee we'd even[N]
get any assistance.[A] At the same time[...][N]
what other choice do we have?[A][N]
But enough of that. Yg'stra's seemingly given[N]
up on chasing us, so we've room to breathe.[A][N]
I think after everything we've been through,[N]
a short break is in order.[A][N]
Plus, our supplies are likely in need[N]
of restocking.[A][N]
Now's a better time than ever to just[N]
take a moment and take in the scenery.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course[...] That all makes sense.[N]
No time like the present, then.[A][N]
Prepare to advance![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]This isn't a real battle, Blair.[N]
But I'll humor you.[A][X]

##IntExplanation
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[...] It's quite nice to have[N]
some respite from battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed. I'd use this time wisely[N]
to explore the city.[A] This would also[N]
be a good time to shop a bit.[A][N]
You can talk to people and visit[N]
buildings much like a normal battle[...][A][N]
Wait, why am I explaining all this?[N]
This is second nature to you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's alright. The flow of battle is[...][N]
different.[A] Almost makes peace seem[N]
unnatural by comparison![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Heh[...] I guess you're right.[A][N]
Well, when you're done, come find me.[A][X]

##I1PeterTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPeter]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
A young lass new to the city?[A][N]
Don't worry. I don't bite.[A][N]
[...]Can't say the same about[N]
old Darahan, here.[A][N]
I'd stand back if I were you.[A][N]
The name's Peter, by the way.[N]
I'm something of a mercenary.[A][N]
[...]Guess that's all there is to say.[N]
What else is there?[A] The merc life's[N]
a cruel thing.[A] You kill to live,[N]
and then you eventually die.[A][N][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
Almost funny, in a way.[N]
Like a twisted joke.[A][N][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
Anyway, great chat. Let's hope if[N]
we meet again, it's not as enemies.[A][X]

##I1PtolemyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
H-Hello there[...] I'm Ptolemy[...][N]
The flowers here a-are quite lovely.[A][N]
I wonder what my bee friends would[N]
think of them[...][A][N]
You don't see them out here in Mevion much[...][N]
Where I'm from, the bees are everywhere.[A][N]
It's something truly delightful to behold.[A][N]
Maybe if I spread more flowers, the bees[N]
will come here, too.[A][N]
Oh[...] Sorry for going on like that.[N]
Here, have this.[A] One of my bee friends[N]
gave it to me[...][A] You seem like a[N]
bee enjoyer, too.[A][X]

##I1EstelleTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][CloseEyes]
[...]Alas, mine life is but a[...][N]
But a[...] No, that won't[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
Oh, hello there. Didn't see you.[A][N]
My name's Estelle, though if you've been[N]
to the playhouse,[A] you may know me by[N]
a different name.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Theatre? We don't have many[N]
theatres in my homeland.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose our political revolution sparked[N]
somewhat of an artistic rebirth as well.[A][N]
Anyway, if you'll be in the city a while,[N]
come by and see our production;[A][N]
it's a modern classic called [OpenQuote]Dawn's Maiden[N]
and the Champion of Radiance.[CloseQuote][A][N]
My role is that of a humble young noblelady,[N]
who wishes for a life of freedom[...][A][N]
She eventually ends up in the company[N]
of a mercenary troupe, and, well[...][A][N]
Look, I don't want to ruin the show for you![A][N]
Anyway, I've been feeling[...] off, with my role.[N]
Normally, I just [OpenQuote]become[CloseQuote] another person[...][A][N]
That's what acting is, ain't it?[A][N]
But for some reason, I feel like I'm[N]
missing a connection[...][A][N]
Maybe what I need is to join a mercenary[N]
troupe myself[...][A][N]
Rift over there's been talking about finding[N]
work[...] I can probably trust him. I think.[A][N]
Anyway, sorry for rambling there.[N]
And welcome to Mevion.[A][X]

##I1RiftTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
Greetings, maiden! I am Rift,[N]
he who is without compare![A][N]
[...]And by that, I mean I'm a[N]
champion gladiator, I suppose.[A][N]
Never really thought about it like that.[N]
When you're in a life-and-death struggle,[A][N]
[OpenQuote]I'm really good at this![CloseQuote] is hardly[N]
the first thought on your mind.[A][N]
Anyhoot, that is why I have sworn[N]
myself to a new goal:[A][N]
finding something better to do![A][N]
[...]Again, the life doesn't really let you[N]
have dreams, per say.[A] So[...] I'm still[N]
working on finding that something.[A][N]
There's lots of mercenary work to be[N]
done all throughout the land, after all.[A][N]
My companion Estelle and I were actually[N]
on the hunt for a job;[A] perhaps today[N]
our search shall bear fruit.[A][N]
Twas lovely meeting you![N]
Let us hope we meet again.[A][X]

##I1MerchantTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Greetings, young woman! Might I interest[N]
you in a mystical relic beyond compare?[A][N]
For a mere 1500 gold, I'll give you[N]
a truly incredible staff![A][N]
What do you say?[A][X]

##I1NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Wait[...] You don't have enough money![N]
What a shame.[A] Come back if you[N]
scrounge up the cash.[A][X]

##I1StaffBuy
Purchase an [OpenQuote]incredible[CloseQuote] staff?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I1StaffPurchased
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure! Here you go.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Delightful[...] Absolutely delightful![A][N]
[...]Now's a good time to mention that I will,[N]
under ZERO circumstances, take refunds.[A][X]

##I1StaffDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No thank you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]What a shame. If you change your[N]
mind, I'll be right here.[A][X]

##I1CitTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Afternoon, lass. Don't think[N]
I've seen you before.[A][N]
Since this is presumably your first[N]
time in Kionius, have some free advice.[A][N]
If someone asks you to buy some[N]
[OpenQuote]mystical relic beyond compare,[CloseQuote][A][N]
think twice. Some people will scam[N]
poor folk out of their hard earned gold.[A][N]
Like that guy over there. He's got some[N]
kind of fancy staff,[A] and he's trying[N]
to sell it for 1500 gold.[A][N]
Normally, it'd cost you 2500 gold![N]
And the shops here don't even carry it![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Isn't that a discount?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Don't believe in the power of discounts.[N]
That's how they get in your head.[A][N]
I once succumbed, and ended up spending[N]
half my salary on a live duck.[A][N]
[...]He's been a faithful companion ever since.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Quack![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha! Quack indeed, Gerald.[N]
[...]Did I have a point here?[A][X]

##I1Cit2Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Why, hello there, young lady![N]
Care to talk to an old man?[A][N]
You look like you'd hardly remember[N]
the days of the revolution![A][N]
Let me tell you, that was something else.[A][N]
I was already a bit too old to fight,[N]
but my son jumped at the chance.[A][N]
He, like most of us, wanted a better Mevion,[N]
and he was a fiery one![A] Willing to fight[N]
tooth and nail for all of us.[A][N]
Oh, he's still alive. Don't worry.[N]
Moved to a small settlement near the sea.[A][N]
I think it's about time I write[N]
to him again, see how he's doing.[A][X]

##I1House1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
Who're you? A visitor?[N]
Don't get those much.[A][N]
Come in, stay a while![A][N]
So[...] how's Mevion?[N]
Great, right?[A][N]
Sure, there's some banditry,[N]
and some tense borders,[A][N]
but what nation doesn't have those?[A][N]
Plus, here in the capital,[N]
you can almost forget all that.[A][N]
We've got the strongest army[N]
I know standing guard.[A][N]
[...]So what if I only know one army?[N]
I'm not wrong![A][X]

##I1House2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Hm[...] Let's see[...][N]
That's 12 gold[...][A][N]
That's another 6 gold[...][N]
Should I splurge?[A] A good splurge[N]
never hurt anyone, right?[A][N]
Then again[...] Should probably[N]
save a bit[...][A] I'll never know if[N]
I'll need the excess for repairs.[A][N]
Who knows how much longer my house[N]
will hold up?[A][N]
[...]Oh, have you been there this whole time?[A][N]
Sorry about that. Just tryin' to[N]
budget some things out, I guess.[A][N]
Even with a stable job, life ain't cheap.[N]
Would do you good to remember that.[A][X]

##I1House3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman3]
Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Forsaken Shortsword,[CloseQuote] Kionius's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[...]You look a little bit young to be[N]
drinking this stuff, I must say.[A][N]
Join the club, I suppose.[N]
Whatever it takes to make it another day.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]I'm good, thanks. Just passing by.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Well, if you ever need to drown a[N]
sorrow or two, just remember:[A][N]
The Forsaken Shortsword has your back.[A][X]

##I1ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Are you finished here, Blair?[A][X]

##I1LeavePrompt
Conclude exploration?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I1NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I still have a few things[N]
I'd like to do here.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Understandable. Take your time.[A][X]

##I1ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
I believe I'm done![N]
Let us proceed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Very well. I believe it would be in[N]
our best interest to-[A][Event][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]Excuse me! Coming through![A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadRachael]
Apologies for that. Would you happen[N]
to be from Aercolyn?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]I[...] would.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Wonderful! I'm from Elba Cor,[N]
and I've a very important message.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadCassius]I'm here too! Don't forget me![A][N]
[OpenRight][...]As I was saying, our king is sympathetic[N]
to your plight,[A] and thus would like[N]
to meet with you.[A][N]
If you need proof, I've a royal seal[N]
right here.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][...]What do you make of this, Arin?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]I'd say this is a brilliant opportunity.[A][N]
It's certainly a better option than petitioning[N]
to a country that we just fought through.[A][N]
[OpenRight]In that case, we shall guide you to Elba Cor.[A][Event][N][MoveRight]
My name is Rachael, of the Elba Cor[N]
pegasus knights.[A] A pleasure to[N]
meet you.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]The name's Cassius. Don't go[N]
forgetting it, alright?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Th-Thank you! Finally[...][N]
Things might be looking up.[A][X]
