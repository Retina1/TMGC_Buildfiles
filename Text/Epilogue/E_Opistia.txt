This has been a truly[N]
unforgettable journey.[A][N]
[...]But I'm ready to return[N]
to a comfortable normal.[A][N]
I'll see if the church needs[N]
me back here,[A] and perhaps[N]
return to my travels soon.[A][N]
[...]I must once again thank you[N]
for saving me way back when.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's what any good person[N]
would've done, Apollo.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I would hope. But it is still[N]
inspiring to spread good.[A][N]
[...]Take care, please.[A][X]

At last, He has delivered unto[N]
us a new era of peace.[A][N]
A peace which I, and all Opistia,[N]
are eager to bask in.[A][N]
[...]All that said, young lady,[N]
I've grown old and weary.[A][N]
I believe soon it may be time[N]
for me to step down,[A] and let[N]
the youths lead the world.[A][N]
Opistia's no shortage of truly[N]
exemplary successors.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps then I can live out[N]
my life's longest-held dream.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To further study and raise wyverns.[A][N]
My dearest friend Wendell could use[N]
some companions of his own.[A][N]
[...]There's a truly ecstatic beauty[N]
to this species.[A] To all the lives[N]
that make up this world.[A][N]
Perhaps that is what inspired me to[N]
seek and spread His meaning.[A][N]
[...]But I digress. Enjoy your time[N]
in Opistia,[A] and thank you for[N]
all you've done for Ulmaron.[A][X]
