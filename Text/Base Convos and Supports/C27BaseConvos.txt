[...]Some days, I'm truly amazed[N]
to still be alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's hardly something I'd ever[N]
expect to hear you say.[A][N]
You're a man in top condition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You don't need to flatter me.[A][N]
I'm an aged man serving an aged crown.[N]
[...]My whole life is an aged thing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That age brings experience[N]
and wisdom, sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Has that experience once served[N]
Lady Aercolyn or His Highness?[A][N]
From what I can tell, they'd be[N]
more than fine without me.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I should be proud of them.[N]
Of His Highness.[A][N]
[...]But this[...] Saddens me?[N]
Fightens me?[A] I'm[...] not so sure.[A][N]
Do[...] I still have a purpose?[A][N]
With the exception of locating and[N]
bringing the young prince home,[A][N]
has anything I've done these past[N]
twelve years mattered?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You've inspired many in Elba Cor[N]
with your unerring devotion.[A][N]
Me included.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Devotion to what? [...]I can't lie[N]
to myself.[A][OpenEyes] Those years were among[N]
Elba Cor's worst.[A] Even beyond the[N]
tragedy,[A] the land was a stagnant[N]
and dying country.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet, you believed that one day,[N]
things would get better.[A][N]
You knew the state of Elba Cor,[N]
and yet you never gave up on it.[A][N]
Never gave into despair.[A][N]
And that's[...] That's how many of[N]
us carried on.[A] And now, you've[N]
given Elba Cor a new life.[A][N]
You're truly a boon to us all, sir.[A][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]Well. Make me proud, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We will, sir.[A][X]

Ye give it any more[N]
thought, 'olly?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] I think I'll give[N]
'er a shot. The seas.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fer real? What changed yer[N]
mind, if I may ask?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I think I do need[N]
a constant in me life.[A][N]
But I think I'd rather it[N]
be ye than some place.[A][N]
I[...] truly did miss ya.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Always thought you were so[N]
lucky back then.[A][N]
[...]Maybe I was just unlucky.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
'ey, the past's in the past.[A][N]
These folks 'ave shown me that[N]
who you are ain't a big deal.[A][N]
It's who ye want to be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Heh. Cheesy, but not[N]
bad, Bechamel.[A][N]
We've a lot o' catchin'[N]
up ta do, still.[A][N]
But once we're done 'ere,[N]
we're sea bound.[A][N]
And maybe we'll get tired[N]
o' that one day.[A][N]
But[...] Until then, I'll give[N]
ge a chance, brother.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We'll do great things,[N]
Holly. I'm sure o' it.[A][X]

Arbordia. Can't say I've[N]
ever been.[A] At least[N]
not while lucid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're not missing much.[A][N]
Some good eats here and[N]
there,[A] but it's just[N]
another city, really.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And now it's just another[N]
conquest.[A] Just the way[N]
things go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yup.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why're you still here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why're you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey, I've told you.[A][N]
Good people died for me.[N]
Least I could do is this.[A][N]
[...]Hopefully it's what they'd[N]
want of me, anyway.[A][N]
You've got no ghosts.[N]
No closet skeletons.[A][N]
Are you miserable or no?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Neither of us are the kind[N]
to ever swear on anything.[A][N]
But I still feel some sense[N]
of duty to Viridian.[A][N]
Never thought I would.[A][N]
But you? I'm almost sure[N]
you have nothing here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I have nothing anywhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Huh.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd figure you'd understand.[A][N]
We're the same, really. Alone.[N]
Uncared for. Uncaring.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Can't even deny it.[A][N]
Well, at least I've some[N]
kind of camaraderie.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Can't say I'm not grateful.[A][X]
