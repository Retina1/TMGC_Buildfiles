Howdy, lassie![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who're you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You haven't noticed me? But I'm the[N]
guy who saves your suspend data[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Anyway, the name's Jake. I'm here[N]
to tell you about my girlie, Anna.[A][N]
She runs a network of so-called[N]
Secret Shops around the world.[A][N]
There's a few here in Ulmaron, even![A][N]
Thing is, they're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] well, secret.[N]
Not only that, but you can't just walk in.[A][N]
You'll need a shining gold member's card![N]
I think there's one in the palace[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Could you perhaps tell us[N]
where the shop is?[A][N]
If you're helping your girlfriend's business,[N]
it doesn't do good to not know where it is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aw, fine. I'll give ya a little hint.[N]
Now, remember this well![A][N]
The shop's somewhere not reachable by foot.[N]
You'll have to swim for it![A][N]
Furthermore[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, let's just say Yg'stra's[N]
not the only thing [OpenQuote]falling[CloseQuote] today.[A][N]
Well, that's all from me. I'll find you[N]
again when there's another shop nearby.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks?[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello there. You're[N]
Blair, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's correct! You're one of[N]
the defectors, right?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Carbon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
In the flesh. No doubt you've[N]
heard tales of my skill.[A][N]
Have a look at this move![A][N][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wahoo![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] impressive?[N]
Not sure if it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] practical.[A][N]
I can't really see you hitting anything[N]
if you're flailing like that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm not flailing. It's[N]
a power stance.[A][N]
You know. For drawing[N]
out my power.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wait! Don't go, pretty lady![N]
I've more moves to show you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Did you just call me-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Number one! The Carbon Slide![A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Number two! The Carbon Roller![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
I'll just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Urgh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadCarbon]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There we go. I'm up.[A][N]

Well, Carbon. No turning back for us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To be fair, did we ever[N]
have that luxury?[A][N]
We fight to live, and[N]
we live to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] There's more[N]
to living than that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Agree.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] After everything Yg'stra's[N]
done for us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This hurts.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You said it yourself. This is[N]
how we end the war.[A][N]
Personally, I would've gone[N]
on living either way,[A][N]
but there's no chance in hell[N]
I'm abandoning you.[A][N]
We're dishonorable brothers-in-arms[N]
until we die.[A] Speaking of[N]
dishonor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveMidLeft] I snagged you[N]
a little something from the armory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Carbon. Do you really think[N]
I can use this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you asking for moral reasons[N]
or practical reasons?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's just say both.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, your sister uses axes. Sure,[N]
this thing brutalizes axe users.[A][N]
But you don't really think she'd[N]
ever fight you, right?[A][N]
As for the practicality argument[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Just stab half a dozen guys.[A][N]
You'll be a lance master in no time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate the advice.[N]
And thanks for this, in any case.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's the least I could do.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Bythewayyouowemedinnerokaybye[N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup. He never changes.[A][X]

I must say, Flynn.[N]
Your technique is marvelous.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm curious, though. Where'd you[N]
learn?[A] One of my knights knows[N]
a skill to strike twice swiftly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But five times in succession?[N]
That's unheard of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I just picked it up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Remarkable! Perhaps you could[N]
show the recruits a thing sometime.[A][N]
I've never been one for swords.[N]
Always liked the heft of lances more.[A][N]
Plus, I was mostly trained to fight[N]
on horseback, and lances are ideal.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
All my lances have a story.[N]
Like my dear banner lance.[A][N]
Accidentally overbudgeted our army once.[A][N]
Had to make a battle standard by tying[N]
a stick and cloth to an axe handle.[A][N]
I'm amazed it's as functional[N]
as it is. How about you?[A][N]
Tell me about your blade.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] like to hear? Well, my sword[N]
of choice is this shimmersword[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, an anti-magic sword? How[N]
intriguing! Do carry on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'd be glad.[A][X]

Hello there, mister![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Back off, kid. I'm not a charity.[N]
Go beg for scraps elsewhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd never beg, mister! I'm a[N]
hard-working hero![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, realy? Then save me from having[N]
to deal with you and bug off.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay. Maybe I went a little far.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]God damn it.[A][N]
Fine. What do you want?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I was wondering if you could teach[N]
me your stealin' skills![A][N]
I could learn to steal from the rich[N]
and give to the poor![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]

Hey, pal. Name's Cassius.[N]
I heard you're something of a cook.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm Mikey, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well,[N]
you'd be correct.[A][N]
I don't think I'm anything[N]
all too special[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I guess someone said[N]
otherwise to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, yeah. Look, after this[N]
fight, if you'd be willin'[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Could ya' cook me up something?[A][N]
I need salvation from army[N]
rations. No offense to them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a bit forward, but sure.[A][N]
What're you thinking?[N]
I can make pretty much anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about something[N]
meaty and rich, with a bit of spice?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll see what I can do.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, pal. What do ya' want[N]
from me in return?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll just take a round of sparring.[N]
It'd do me well to work against axes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, then. That sounds like a deal.[N]
See ya' after the battle, Mikey.[A][X]

Hey, Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What can I do you for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just wanted to talk.[A][N]
Say, what's the king think of us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Us? You mean our army us,[N]
or Mevion us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mevion. I'm just curious, is all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, considering he believes that[N]
you're the reason his son is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Yeah, I don't think he likes[N]
you Mevs very much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. But still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is it fair to hate[N]
a nation for the acts of a few radicals?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps not. But, hey. Can't[N]
exactly help how you feel.[A][N]
At the very least, you're a[N]
good enough fella.[A][N]
I'm sure the king'd be willing[N]
to share a word with you.[A][N]
But enough politics.[N]
How's life been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine enough?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've been in the same[N]
