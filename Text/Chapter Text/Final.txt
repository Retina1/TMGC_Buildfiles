##FinalArcEnding
And so comes the beginning of an era.[A][N]
Girard's ambitions have finally been[N]
laid to rest,[A] and with them, the[N]
shadows that have long plagued Ulmaron.[A][N]
As Blair and Zeke depart from the[N]
Tower of Opistus,[A] prepared to bring[N]
upon a new age for the continent,[A][N]
they gaze out into the endless horizon[N]
at the top of the world.[A][N]
It is as the youths have spoken.[A][N]
In the future they fought to protect,[N]
anything is possible.[A] The world[N]
will never quite be the same,[A][N]
and though its uncertainty may bring[N]
pain and hardship,[A] it shall also[N]
allow man to do anything it wishes.[A][N]
...Before this future comes the[N]
end of the story of today.[A][N]
The conclusion to the story of Blair,[N]
Zeke,[A] and all those who fought at[N]
their side to the end.[A][N]
...A new dawn is rising over all of Ulmaron.[A][X]

##FinalGirardPhaseShift2
[OpenMidRight][LoadArbordia][CloseEyes]
Avalon[...] Power that has[N]

I call upon you! Let me become[N]

##FinalGirardPhaseShift3
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...]This power[...] I feel it[N]

Come unto me, Aercolyn![A][N]
Bear witness to a power that[N]

Your lives shall wither away[N]
as I claim mine birthright![A][N]
Even as my very being burns into[N]
the future,[A] I shall outlast[N]
each and every one of you![A][N][OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke][OpenLeft][ToggleInvert]
What[...] What happened to him?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Is[...] Is he even still alive?[N]
[...]Then again, it matters not.[A][N]
If he's still standing against[N]
us, no matter his state,[A][N]
we must strike him down.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well. If he'll give up[N]
everything for his future,[A][N]
then we'll fight with[N]
everything for ours![A][X]

##Final_Ending

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]It's over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] is.[A][ToggleSmile] It really is.[A][N]
We've done much today.[A][N]
And now, it's time to[N]
return and rebuild.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] I guess so.[A][N]
[...]It's dizzying to think.[N]
We've come so far.[A][N]
Truly, anything's[N]
possible for us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
After today, nothing will[N]
ever be the same again.[A][N]
[...]It will all be made better.[A][N]
Everybody! Our journey is[N]
finally over![A] Today, we[N]
return, as Ulmaron's heroes![A][X]

##Final_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[...]It's been a long time[N]
since I was here alone.[A][N]
[...]The world below is such[N]
a distant thing.[A][N]
I can[...] truly see forever.[N]
All its glory[...] All its flaws.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Those flaws need not persist[N]
forever.[A] This world can be[N]
better. I can make it better.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It shan't be an easy road.[N]
Nor one all will agree with.[A][N]
But[...] Some things require sacrifice.[N]
Everyone can understand that.[A][N]
And perhaps one day everyone will[N]
be able to look at what I do[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Then again, what do they matter?[A][N]
If I know I'm a just man, then[...][N]
Enough of this, Girard.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]It's time for action. Today, the[N]
unification of Ulmaron begins.[A][N]
We shall rise to meet our[N]
glorious future.[A][X]

##Final_FlashbackAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
This is[...] truly a wonder.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is, Elcorian.[A][N]
You can see forever from up here.[N]
[...]It's unfortunate, really.[A][N]
The world deserves this freedom.[N]
This contentment.[A][N]
But it's a terrible and lawless place.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's definitely[...][N]
room for improvement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But that's why I'm where I am.[N]
So I can change this world.[A][N]
I'll do anything it takes,[N]
for the future of man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You and I. We'll make it happen.[N]
We'll[...] We'll be legends.[A][N]
Remembered as the heroes who made[N]
the hardest of sacrifices.[A][N]
[...]Come. I've a message to deliver[N]
to the young Aercolyn.[A] Something[N]
about Neillstrom territory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I can handle that, if you[N]
so wish.[A] You're a busy man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I appreciate it. [...]I won't hold[N]
you. I'll be up here a bit longer.[A][N]
My notes on the subject are all[N]
on my desk. Take what you need.[A][N]
Good luck with[...] her.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]What will your legacy be?[N]
Will you be another Sinclair?[A][N]
[...]That[...] damnable man.[A][N]

##Final_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
So this[...] is the top[N]
of the Tower.[A][N]
I've read of it before,[N]
but to be here myself[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] marvelous.[A][N]
But we're not here to[N]
sightsee.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Lead the way.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBlank]
You needn't go anywhere.[N]

##Final_Opening2

Stand down, or there will[N]

We've already defeated[N]

how this will end?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you think that I would've[N]
shown my hand that early?[A][N]
Elcorian believed that he[N]
could change your mind.[A][N]
To the end. [...]Poor fool that[N]
he was, I suppose.[A][N]
It was for him that I didn't[N]
purge you from existence.[A][N]
[...]With him gone, there's nobody[N]
left to tell me otherwise.[A][N]
And, besides. I don't fight[N]
alone.[A] [...]Did you think those[N]

All those you once slew are[N]
now at my command.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]You[...] You don't mean[...][N]
More of those simulacra[...]?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They are the pinnacle of our knowledge.[N]
To call them facsimile would be to err.[A][N]
They are superior. Ascendant. Their[N]
being shall serve a glorious purpose.[A][N]
They wield power that has long since[N]
only been told of in legend.[A][N]
In short, they are the heralds of[N]
Dalst's glorious future.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You all speak of a future.[A][N]
But what in the hell is[N]
this future meant to be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The world will be unified as one[N]
glorious Dalst under our rule.[A][N]
There will be no conflict.[N]
No strife. No pain.[A][N]
At least, not for us.[A][N]
Our heralds, our arbiters[...][N]
It shall become their burden.[A][N]
A worthy sacrifice for the sake[N]
of all, I say.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]So you wish to conquer the[N]
world with these beings.[A][N]
[...]You're nothing more than a[N]
tyrant to be put down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What you believe a tyrant,[N]
tomorrow will call a hero.[A][N]
But you will evidently never[N]
