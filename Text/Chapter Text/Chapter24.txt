Sure, sure.[A][N]
Anyway, here's an old bow[N]
I've kept for eons.[A][N]
Had it back when I was mortal.[A][N]
I think some of my skill rubbed[N]
off on it.[A] Pick it up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Okay?[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
[...]Woah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]As predicted. You're now an[N]
inheritor of my skill.[A][N]
Hundreds of years of training with[N]
the bow, all in an instant.[A][N]
[...]Pretty sweet, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] fun.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That'll do for me.[A][N]
Now, child of man[...][N]
Let your new skills shine through![A][N]
Show me what you can do![A][X]

[...]Easy, boy. Stay right over there.[N]
I don't want you getting hurt.[A][N]
If you think this is the place,[N]
I trust your instincts.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll see Archbishop[N]
Vladmir soon.[A][N]
[...]Just be ready to grab me[N]
if things get too dicey. Please.[A][X]

Greetings, Girard. What did[N]
you wish to see me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're of keener mind than I.[N]
Have a look at this.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
What in the[...] That's[...][N]
a lot of notes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The results of my trip to[N]
Holanis.[A] The life's work[N]
of Lord Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[...] you wish me to[N]
analyze them?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You pick up on things fast.[A][N]
See what's of worth within[N]
this pile.[A] Destroy the rest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Surely, if what I heard's[N]
accurate, this can't be all of it.[A][N]
Sinclair was a thorough man.[A][N]
This[...] isn't enough for him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why I'm making more than[N]
one trip.[A] [...]Say, would you[N]
mind coming along?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. That'll simplify[N]
matters greatly.[A][N]
[...]This is the best way to get[N]
back at him.[A][N]
Using what he did for the[N]
good of the Alliance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure is a way to look at it.[A][N]
[...]If we're done here, I'd better[N]
be off. Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What's this document on top, anyway?[N]
