Watch your step. The swamps[N]
get real bad starting here,[A][N]
and it's obviously pretty dark.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't give me that look.[N]
You can wash your clothes later.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Wait. I think I hear something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe there's Mevionese nearby.[N]
Be on your guard.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, yup. Can't imagine you'd be[N]
welcomed this close to the border.[A][N]
As I explained, you gotta get a bit closer[N]
to the capital to escape patrols.[A][N]
At this point, we're not getting out[N]
of a skirmish.[A] To make matters worse,[N]
the patrols are used to this darkness.[A][N]
I was too, once, but it's been far too long.[A][N]
[OpenRight]We'll just have to push forward.[A][N]
I'd imagine if they've got[N]
some kind of leader here,[A][N]
defeating them will be enough of a[N]
distraction to push our way through.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]We'll just want to move quickly.[A][N]
While the Yg'strans are being slowed[N]
by the swamps,[A] I'd think they'd catch[N]
up if we dawdle here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, don't keep us waiting, then.[N]
Get yourselves together for battle.[A][X]

##Ch5_Opening_Dead_Peggy
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
I think this is the right way[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I hope it is, at least.[A][N]
Between the darkness and the swamps,[N]
we're lucky to not be totally lost.[A][N]
At least there's some semblance[N]
of well-traveled paths.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This still feels wrong.[N]
That woman helped us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and died for it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We're beyond doubts now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. I think I hear something.[N]
Likely some more Mevionese.[A][N]
Guess we're still not far enough west[N]
to escape the border patrols.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]We're to fight in the darkness?[N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] probably not great.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the only choice we've got.[A][N]
If we can find and defeat this squad's[N]
leader, we can exploit the resulting chaos.[A][N]
Probably make a clean escape.[A][N]
Which is of particular importance since[N]
the Yg'strans are still behind us.[A][N]
The swamps can't hold them back forever,[N]
after all.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll prepare for battle.[A][N]
Let's just hope this is our last,[N]
if only for a short while.[A][X]

##Ch5_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy]
This way, you fools![N]
Before they regroup![A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
The capital should only be another[N]
day away, if I remember correctly.[A][N]
As long as we lay low, we should[N]
arrive mostly unscathed.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Excellent.[A][N]
[OpenRight]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what do we actually[N]
do once we're there?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's up to you guys.[N]
We'll be safe for a while.[A][N]
Whatever you decide, I might as well[N]
tag along.[A] You're a fun bunch,[N]
after all.[A]
[OpenRight]Thank you, Peggy.[N]
You've been a lifesaver.[A][X]

##Ch5_Ending_Dead_Peggy
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin]
This way, Blair![N]
Before they notice![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] harrowing.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]At least the capital shouldn't[N]
be too much further now.[A][N]
My hope is that it'll be a safe[N]
place to plan our next move.[A][N]
As for what that next move is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]We'll figure that out.[N]
For now, we just keep running.[A][X]

##Ch5_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCallum][OpenMidRight][LoadValden]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate, soldier.[A][N]
Know that I aim to pursue[N]
this to my greatest ability.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that all?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your concerns are important.[A][N]
But this is a very[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] trying time.[N]
Your wishes may have to wait.[A][N]
Until then, continue to serve[N]
your country's needs.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You may leave.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Lazarus! I've words for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
General Valden.[N]
To what do I owe your presence?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lazarus. Am I to believe you defied[N]
orders to chase after a young noble?[A][N]
Not only that, but you failed at your[N]
own game of insubordination?[A][N]
As second-in-command, I believed you to[N]
be more capable of serving your country,[A][N]
not your own twisted ideals.[A][N]
While your combat skills are excellent,[N]
that's not all there is to war.[A][N]
In fact, I just finished conversing[N]
with a soldier under your retinue.[A][N]
He's had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] much to say.[A][N]
Know that if this happens again,[A][N]
judgement shall be swift, and you shall become[N]
nothing more than a common soldier.[A][N][CloseEyes]
We are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all here to serve our emperor.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Bah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What a worthless man, serving[N]
a ruler instead of himself.[A][N]
Once I get my hands on that girl[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He'll see his error. And better yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
The emperor will see his error.[N]
Then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'll get what I deserve.[A][N]
For now, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I suppose the[N]
Elba Cor invasion will have to do.[A][X]

##Ch5_NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Wanna hear a little secret?[N]
Lunatics get hit more.[A][N]
What does it mean? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] got nothing.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look. Honestly, it's not a real secret.[A][N]
It just came to me in a dream,[N]
and I thought it sounded cool.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, maybe it's prophetic?[A][N]
[OpenQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you consider yourself a lunatic,[N]
watch your back.[CloseQuote][A] [OpenQuote]Maybe you can't[N]
rely on dodging blow after blow.[CloseQuote][A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I definitely shouldn't quit my job[N]
for a career in dream interpretation.[A][X]

##Ch5_SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
I don't think I've seen you around[N]
these parts before.[A] You must be[N]
wondering how we cope with these swamps.[A][N]
Honestly? They're not that bad.[A][N]
Sure, wading through them feels like[N]
walking through dense forests sometimes,[A][N]
but they don't hurt us, and they give us[N]
some excellent foliage.[A][N]
Imagine if the swamps DID hurt us![N]
That'd be real hell on earth.[A][X]

##Ch5_Butch_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do I know you? You seem[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
awfully familiar.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]So, you do recognize me, Peggy.[N]
It's Butch. From Mevion.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I got the [OpenQuote]from Mevion[CloseQuote] part from[N]
context, you dummy. But yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I definitely remember you now![N]
How've ya been, old man?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm only 43. I'd like to think[N]
that's not old.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Keep dreaming, pal. What's[N]
got you here, anyway?[A] Thought you[N]
hung up your sword years ago.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I could ask that of you-[A][N]
last I recall, you went off on some[N]
pilgrimage 10 years ago.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, that. Eventually, I ended up at[N]
some church on the border.[A][N]
Served there for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] 5 years, now? Maybe 6?[A][N]
Look, I was basically a kid during[N]
the revolution. Lots has changed.[A][N]
All that is to say, now I've somehow[N]
ended up with these Dalstians.[A][N]
They're great- and more importantly,[N]
they can keep things interesting.[A][N]
Do you know how tiring it is to do[N]
the same thing day in and day out?[A][N]
Cause if not, well, that's a life[N]
of the cloth for you.[A][N]
Anyway, we're headed to Kionius.[N]
They can take refuge there.[A][N]
What about you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. I took up a post here[N]
a few months back.[A] Wanted a piece of that[N]
self-fulfillment pie.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And here we[N]
are now. Sadly, you know how it is.[A][N]
If you're aiding these foreigners,[N]
it doesn't matter who you are.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Well, to think you'd raise a blade against[N]
the woman who saved your life![A] You're an[N]
absolute disgrace and coward![A][N]
If anything, you should be joining ME![N]
You still owe me for that![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, for the love of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Besides, all these Dalstians have done[N]
is flee from Yg'stra![A][N]
Surely, this real war is more important than[N]
the imaginary one in your thick skull![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I suppose I do owe you[N]
this chance.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I swear, how do you[N]
still remember that?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Less whining, more fighting.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And it's good to see you again.[A][X]

##Ch5_Rachael_Cassius
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Woah, there! Slow down,[N]
Rachael! Do you want me to fall?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Amusing as it'd be, I'd rather you[N]
not die. After all, imagine the paperwork.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're very funny.[A][N]
Look, have you ever held on for dear[N]
life to a creature that hates you-[A][N]
purely for being a man?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's not very fun![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Complain later. I think I see them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]All I see is darkness and shadows,[N]
but I'll trust ya.[A] Do we make our move?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They appear to be embroiled[N]
in conflict. On the run, as well.[A][N]
It may be for the best to lay low.[A][N]
We wouldn't want to overwhelm them,[N]
get caught in the conflict,[A][N]
or potentially be mistaken for a foe.[N]
We'll head to Kionius.[A][N]
I'd imagine that's their target.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]More flyin'? Can't we take[N]
ten minutes to stretch?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No.[A][N]
(My king[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Surely you could've sent[N]
someone besides Cassius[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove])[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hey! I heard that![A][X]

##C5MitchellBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
You've come quite far.[N]
I applaud you.[A][N]
Unfortunately, you're about[N]
to die. Goodbye.[A][X]

##C5MitchellButchBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
Butch? What're you doing,[N]
raising your blade?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Unfortunately, an old[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
acquaintance, we'll say-[A][N]
asked for a favor.[A][N]
She asked I help guide the[N]
Dalstians to Kionius.[A][N]
Said they're a good bunch.[A][N]
And you know what? Maybe[N]
she's right.[A] Maybe our lives[N]
fighting them were meaningless.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
You'd throw out your pride[N]
on a whim like that?[A][N]
Perhaps I misread you.[A][N]
Well, much as I'd rather not do[N]
this, I have to kill you now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Luckily for you, you won't[N]
have to worry about that.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll kill you first.[A][X]

##C5MitchellPeggyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
Young woman, do I know you?[N]
You seem familiar.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Nope![N]
You're nothing to me.[A][N]
I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint,[N]
but that'd be a lie.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
Well, then. Guess I won't[N]
have to feel bad about this.[A][X]

##C5MitchellDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] failed.[A][N]
Who'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] keep[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] safe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][X]

##ButchKillsPeggy
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Butch?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What in the hell[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
was that for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Look me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] in the eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
when I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] dying[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] bastard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][X]

##C5Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMitchell]
What's our strategy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Their pursuers- whoever they are-[N]
some of their footmen might arrive.[A][N]
Before then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Maybe deploy a few[N]
units to fight them.[A][N]
Not many, though- why risk my men[N]
when others'll handle it just fine?[A][X]

##C5Hint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch]
You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I never thought that[N]
this is how my life would be.[A][N]
Thought maybe I'd do more for my[N]
country than shoo foreigners.[A][N]
Alas[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Maybe those glory days[N]
truly are gone forever[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Wonder how that lass has been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Peggy, if memory serves.[A][N]
Quite the feisty one- she'd probably[N]
knock me out of this funk.[A][X]
