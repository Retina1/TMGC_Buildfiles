So, they approach.[A] [...]Send troops[N]
out as they near the villages.[A][N]
And of course, if they near us.[A][N]
If we slow them down enough,[A][N]
perhaps Mason's remnants'll arrive[N]
and bring an end to this.[A][X]

##C25Warning2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert]

the distance.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]Run while[N]
you can, Aercolyn.[A][N]

[...]Lady Blair.[N]
[...]It's been[...] some time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Elcorian! What is this?[N]
Explain yourself![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Calm yourself. I wish not to[N]
harm you.[A] [...]I just wish to[N]
speak with you one on one.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps explain my actions.[A][N]
I shall be inside. If you do not[...][N]
wish to talk, I[...] understand.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadZeke]
[...][A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Should[...] I hear him out?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Every fiber of my being wants[N]
to say this is a trap.[A][N][OpenRight]
I[...] agree. But I still want[N]
to at least know why.[A][N]
Why he's assisted in the horrors[N]
we've seen.[A] [...]I'll be alright.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]If you're certain about this,[N]
I won't stop you.[A][N]
Just[...] be on your guard.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Certainly.[A][X]

##C25EndingDebate
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm glad you accepted this.[N]
Please, have a seat.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm certain you have a great[N]
many questions.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Drop this act. I know what you[N]
and Arbordia have been doing.[A][N]
Your experiments in Fort Jraeyan.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Why[...] would you do this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I simply wish to guarantee us[N]
a glorious future.[A][N]
Tell me. How much have you endured?[N]
How many needless deaths?[A][N]
What if those could all be avoided?[N]
[...]I assume you know of Zeimstadt.[A][N]
The legends within of creating draconic[N]
simulacra.[A] I[...] have refined the[N]
process.[A] I can bring a manner of life[N]
back to the departed.[A][N]
It's[...] currently far from perfect.[A][N]
But even in its current state,[N]
the process has limitless potential.[A][N]
Using those that have already died[N]
to fight our battles,[A] rather than[N]
risk those who are alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]What does any of this have to[N]
do with experimenting on the living?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understanding the living and the[N]
dead are two intertwined goals.[A][N]
Besides, Jraeyan, as you know, has[N]
a great many projects.[A][N]
We seek to bolster the power[N]
within mankind,[A] and to gain[N]
understanding of all things.[A][N]
[...]As it is, sacrifice is sometimes[N]
a necessity.[A] It pains me, but those[N]
are lives lost to a grand cause.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]If you're so sure that everything[N]
you've done has been worth lives[...][A][N]
Show me. Anything worth the[N]
lives of my people.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Our work is still-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not your hypotheticals.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Have you torn through innocent[N]
lives for nothing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]What is wrong with you?![N]
Why[...]? Why?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ulmaron is a hellish and dying land.[N]
As I have said, our future-[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Dying? Do you know what you're saying?[A][N]
[...]I've seen this entire continent[N]
over these past few months.[A][N]
Of course there's many who struggle.[N]
Many injustices.[A] But everyone I've met[N]
still gladly goes on.[A] Would you call[N]
that a [OpenQuote]dying[CloseQuote] world?[A][N]
[...]No. If it's dying, it's only[N]
because of shortsighted people like you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Times will change. We won't endure[N]
forever.[A] A noble sacrifice now shall[N]
ensure countless future lives.[A][N]
How can we weigh one life, or ten,[N]
or ten thousand against the endless?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Ten thousand? What[...] sense of[N]
scale are you working off of?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The powers we study brought Holanis[N]
to ruin.[A] We're better off than the[N]
progenitors, but[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I've had enough of this.[A][N]
You're callously taking aim at[N]
every being alive today.[A][N]
It doesn't matter what future[N]
you think may come to pass.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I understand where you're[N]
coming from.[A] Alas, I suppose we[N]
weigh the value of life differently.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's it? That's all you[N]
have to say?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]We're going to stop you.[A][N]
I'm going to stop you.[A][N][OpenEyes]
If I have to kill you to save[N]
Ulmaron from this, I will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Our paths are truly[N]
irreconcilable, then.[CloseEyes][A][N]
[...]So this is how it is.[N]
Truly unfortunate.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]I suppose this is goodbye.[N]
Next we meet, one of us must fall.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]If you truly believe you've the[N]
power to stop us,[A] I challenge you[N]
to prove it.[A] Return now to Aercolyn.[A][N]
We've not touched it once. This isn't[N]
the people's conflict, after all.[A][N]
Girard[...] Lord Arbordia is ordering[N]
all troops march on Aercolyn.[A][N]
If you survive the oncoming storm,[N]
come to Arbordia.[A] I'll[...] be waiting.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've one last thing to say.[N]
[...]Take this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This is[...] one of[N]
Dalst's treasures[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The Foundation.[A][N]
The original founder's most[N]
prized posession.[A][N]
[...]I am simply returning it[N]
to its rightful inheritor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It has long been forgotten,[A][N]
but Arbordia hasn't always been the[N]
nation's most influential state.[A][N]
[...]But that's ancient history now.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Why[...] Why are you[N]
still doing this?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] truly had hoped to show[N]
you to our glorious future.[A][N]
If there can be no compromise,[A][N]
I at least wish to give you the[N]
chance to contest us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][OpenEyes]This[...] doesn't change anything.[A][N]
I truly do appreciate what you've[N]
done for me in the past.[A][N]
[...]But as you yourself said,[N]
that's ancient history now.[A][N]
[...]Goodbye.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I couldn't save her.[A][N]
[...]But it is as it is.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Our glorious future approaches.[A][N]
[...]We[...] must be ready to[N]
sacrifice anything in its name.[A][X]

##C25EndingResolution
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]I'm glad to see you're alright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He was[...] far too civil.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I don't even know if he[N]
comprehends what he's done.[A][N]
Or if those lives are now just[N]
beneath him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Shall we march on Aercolyn?[N]
Or should we rest and prepare?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]We don't need to worry.[A][N]
At least, if he's telling the truth.[N]
[...]Dalst hasn't touched Aercolyn.[A][N]
Our return will be smooth.[A][N]
[...]But Elcorian warned of a massive[N]
invasion force coming for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why would he do that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] don't know. I don't think[N]
I'll ever understand him now.[A][N]
But we'd better use our time well.[N]
We've been given this warning.[A][N]
It'd be a loss to waste it.[A][N]
And if it's untrue, we still ought[N]
to prepare anyway.[A][N]
After all, at this point, I think[N]
there's only one way this can end.[A][N]
[...]We're going to have to overthrow[N]
Lord Arbordia.[A] Bring him and the rest[N]
of Dalst to task.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It won't be easy. But I've[N]
stuck around for this long.[A][N]
I'll fight by your side until[N]
the conclusion, as always.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I still owe it to those mercs.[N]
Avenging them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then let's not waste any more time.[A][N]
[...]I'm finally coming home.[A][X]

##C25ArinSimoneTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Well. Have you made[N]
your choice, child?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's nothing you[N]
need hide.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] still want to know why.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There are many whys[N]
that you could seek.[A][N]
Why did we do this?[N]
Why you? Why this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, you said it yourself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I suppose so.[A][N]
Well, in order, then.[A][N]
We did what we did[...] All of what[N]
we do[...] for nothing.[A][N]
The others try and say it's for[N]
knowledge or the future or whatever.[A][N]
But I see through that crap.[A][N]
They do it[...] I did it to try[N]
and pretend it all had purpose.[A][N]
Funny, really. The only purpose[N]
was that which we ascribed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
As for why you, call it luck.[A][N]
Some manner of divinations sensed[N]
power within you,[A] but frankly,[N]
any other subject would've done.[A][N]
And why I've told you all this?[A][N]
As I've made clear. I believe our[N]
work's lacked purpose.[A][N]
Letting it out into the world to[N]
prove its worth is my goal.[A][N]
And if said work doesn't know what[N]
it's a part of, that's quite unfair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] still don't know how[N]
to comprehend all this.[A][N]
But I know that trusting you is[N]
the best choice I have.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Excellent.[A][N]
Once we're settled in Aercolyn,[N]
I'll guide you.[A][N]
You shall[...] ascend.[A][N]
Perhaps give these last 17[N]
years something worthwhile.[A][N]
Until then, keep well, Lirel.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You too.[A][X]

##C25Opening
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[...]We're finally here.[A][N]
It's been[...] so long.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]To think I'd be returning[N]
home like this.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
[...]I truly wish this could[N]
be a more joyous moment.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll[...][A][OpenEyes] We'll make it joyous.[A][N]
Saving Dalst from its[N]
inner darkness[...][A][N]
That's something I'd say[N]
is worth celebrating.[A][N]
[...]But the road there is still[N]
long and uncertain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hold. I see something ahead.[A][X]

##C25Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
Sir Bobert. The traitor's[N]
army approaches.[A][N]
What're our orders?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Spare them not a shred of mercy.[A][N]
There might, by chance, be faces[N]
you once knew from Dalst.[A][N]
Those faces are now the faces[N]
of your enemy.[A] The faces of[N]
those who kill their fellows.[A][N]
Even my sister[...] may very well[N]
be among them.[A] She too[...] won't[N]
be spared judgement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Understandable, sir.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]

in there anyway, Elcorian?[A][X]

##C25Opening3

The one who can save her.[A][N]
Guide her to our glorious future.[A][N]
[...][A][OpenEyes]It'll all be worth it.[A][X]

##C25Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Even more resistance[...][A][N]
How much does Dalst have[N]
to send our way?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Better not to think about that.[A][N]
We'll just have to break through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Looks like they've a fortification[N]
at that manor across the cliffs.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]If this is where I'm thinking[N]
it is,[A] that manor's one of[...][N]
my father's old retreats.[A][N]
It's about as close as we can get to[N]
Aercolyn without being IN Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Our objective's clear, then.[A][N]
Take control of that manor,[N]
then march on Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]This[...] hasn't gotten easier.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But even so, for the sake[N]
of all of my people[...][A][N]
For everyone who's suffered[N]
because of me[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
I refuse to back down![A][N]
Everyone! Move out! We march[N]
in the name of righteousness![A][X]

My daughter saw a shooting star[N]

[...]This crystal fell from the heavens[N]

[...]Bit of an unfortunate wish, I guess.[A][N]
Holding onto this thing feels[N]
unlucky now.[A] Can you take it?[N]

It feels[...] powerful, though.[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Ah, hello. I was just about to take[N]
this sword over to Anna's.[A][N]
Her shop's been stocking them lately,[N]
and our town's got some extras.[A][N]
It's good business.[A][N]
[...]Say, if you're leaving anyway,[N]
could you take this to her shop?[A][N]
Its exact location is a secret, but[N]
you could probably figure it out.[A][N]
Just[...] make sure you actually[N]
bring it to her.[A][N]
It'll be really awkward if it never[N]
shows up and she learns I got lazy.[A][N]

You appear to be well equipped.[A][N]

I've seen the whole world.[A][N]
Honed quite the skill with my blade.[A][N]
[...]Lost an arm along the way, but[N]
that didn't change much.[A][N]
I'd tell you all about it, but[N]
you seem busy.[A] [...]In that case,[N]
mind if I follow you?[A][N]
I wish to spin more stories to tell.[N]
And you seem like an interesting bunch.[A][N]
[...]Very well. Let us begin, then.[N]
I shall prove my mastery.[A][X]

Hmph. That beast's not right.[A][N]
I've no clue where Dalst got themselves[N]
some dragons, but I don't like 'em.[A][N]
Big and wrathful creatures that could[N]
destroy a town in an instant.[A][N]
Truly, the best choice to fight our wars.[A][N]
[...]Do me a solid, and kill them all.[A][N]
Really, you'd be doing the whole[N]
nation a solid by ridding it of them.[A][X]

##C25House2Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan6]
I've had some strange dreams, lately.[A][N]
The number 236 keeps popping up in[N]

[...]Only ever since I've visited that[N]
town that's a bit south, strangely.[A][N]
[...]It's probably meaningless, anyway.[A][N]
There's nothing I have 236 of.[A][N]
[...]Though there are things I have[N]
2 of, 3 of, and 6 of.[A][N]

You've got a handful of decisive[N]

One of those elites walking around[N]
has a really powerful weapon.[A][N]

I think it's magnifying her strength[N]

[...]You seem fixated on something.[N]
[...]It's that look in your eyes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Apologies, Ethyl. I'm still caught[N]
up in the[...] abusrdity of it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That drivel about Holanis's[N]
ancient dragons?[A][N]
[...]You're a reasonable man.[N]
And that's all fantasy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I returned to Jraeyan again.[A][N]
I found[...] one of them.[N]
An artificial dragon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]And?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They truly can create life.[A][N]
It's not just delusions of[N]
a madman playing god.[A][N]
[...]There might be value in seeking[N]
out what we scattered.[A][N]
Offering them a proposal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd work alongside those[N]
vile scholars?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's for the lasting[N]
prosperity of Dalst[...][A][N]
I'd gladly hoist that burden.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm just concerned how quickly[N]
you changed your tune.[A][N]
The same people who were madmen under[N]
Sinclair will now be our future.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Such is the power of a[N]
strong guiding hand.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand your trepidation.[A][N]
But I truly believe leveraging[N]
these scholars is in our interest.[A][N]
The world's on the brink of change.[N]
We need to ensure our stability.[A][N]
The power and knowledge within those[N]
walls might just do that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]If you insist.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Well. Let's not lose[N]
any more time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're coming? Just like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know your decision's unshakeable now.[A][N]
But you still need someone looking[N]
out for you.[A] Besides[...] I won't[N]
lie and say I'm not interested.[A][N]
From the notes I've read so far,[N]
there's some[...][A] Well, interesting projects.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And they shall serve our needs.[N]
The needs of our land.[A][X]

##C25BobertSamTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
[...]Brother[...] Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Samantha. I presume you[N]
understand why I'm here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'd[...] rather not fight you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, well. Arbordia willed it so.[N]
And this is Barford's chance.[A][N]
Every one of your siblings has[N]
failed our house.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]You can still come back.[N]
There's a place for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] can't. Not[...][N]
after this.[A][N]
I've[...] grown, brother.[N]
If I must, I'll face you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Very well.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Perhaps your leaving was[N]
what you needed, after all.[A][N]
I'm[...] glad for you. And glad[N]
I got to see you again.[A][N]
I see you use the bow.[N]
[...]Good choice.[A][N]
Guess it runs in the family.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've carried this around far too long.[A][N]
It's[...] a keepsake of Father's.[A][N]
He gave it to me years back.[N]
But I've never used it.[A][N]
Did I want to prove myself[N]
on my own terms? Perhaps.[A][N]
[...]In any case[...] You might[N]
as well have it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Come. It's time to fulfill[N]
our duties, sister.[A][N]
Prove to me your new resolve![A][X]
