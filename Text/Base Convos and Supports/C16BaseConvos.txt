Hello, there! You're one of[N]
the prince's, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That'd be correct, milady.[A][N]
He happened upon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] an acquaintance[N]
and I, and came to our aid.[A][N]
So now, here we are.[N]
I'm Avan, by the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's nice to finally talk to you.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You probably know, but I'm Blair.[A][N]
I must say, that flower in your[N]
hair is truly remarkable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you. I happened upon it[N]
in Mevion,[A] and it was simply[N]
too beautiful to pass up.[A][N]
I've been keeping it alive the[N]
past few months with my staves.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who knew they worked[N]
on plants?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wow[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's pretty[N]
spectacular.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a nice reminder of my homeland.[A][N]
No matter where I may wander, this[N]
flower'll be by my side.[A][N]
Well, not my side. You know[N]
what I mean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, I get it. It sounds comforting.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's nothing too important.[N]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] an idea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, battle's on[N]
the horizon.[A][N]
I'll leave you to think about[N]
whatever you're scheming.[A][N]
It was great finally getting[N]
to talk to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, Avan![A][X]

Ah, Lady Blair! It's good to[N]
see you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello, Carbon.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
What's that tone for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you wish to grace me[N]
with more[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] moves?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps. But if you don't[N]
like them, that's fine.[A][N]
There's more to the Carbon experience.[N]
Take a look at this![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
Are those[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sketches?[N]
They're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] marvelous![A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] side venture. In order[N]
to perfect my form,[A][N]
I've taken to studying anatomy,[N]
and to aid in that,[A][N]
what better than to sketch[N]
out my technique?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's not as good as you think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nonsense! This is briliant![N]
Now I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Now I feel bad.[A][N]
About earlier.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
All's fair. I get I can be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
overwhelming.[A][N]
But, hey. If you want to talk[N]
more, I'd always be glad.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. That sounds nice.[A][X]

That sounds[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] edible?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure is. All ye need is water,[N]
flour, and heat![A]
Simple enough that even me and[N]
me mates cannae flub it up![A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. We'll still rematch.[N]
But I'll cook again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Good choice, lassie. Let's just say there[N]
be reason I don't have all me teeth.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Well, make sure not to lose a few[N]
more today. You're not taking me down![A][X]

All you'll say to me?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do you want?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing, really. I just remember how[N]
you used to look up to me.[A][N]
Back when I was your age.[N]
It was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] cute, almost.[A][N]
And now look where your idol[N]
among the Elba Corian knights is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you have a purpose here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't you despise me? Don't you[N]
despise yourself for looking up to me?[A][N]
I am EVERYTHING you hate![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] good to see you well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
