We'll fan our forces[N]

Again, if Arbordia left,[N]
he'll likely return.[A][N]
And that's when we make[N]
our final stand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. [...]To think he's[N]
finally dead.[A][N][CloseEyes]
He[...] wasn't always this way.[N]
He used to be kind.[A][N]
Understanding. One of the few[N]
who'd stand for Aercolyn.[A][N]
[...]But at the same time, I can't[N]
even say he's really changed.[A][N]
It's never felt like he became[N]
this way.[A] [...]Maybe he always[N]
was truly like this.[A][N]
Some god-complex ridden man.[N]
[...]Like the rest of the council.[A][N]
Like[...] Like my father.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]But I'll be different from[N]
them. I[...] have to be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've long proven that you are,[N]
Blair.[A] [...]I'll[...] see to it[N]
that the mercenaries[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
That they get the respect[N]
they deserve in the end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[...]Alright. I just[...] have some[N]

He[...] wasn't always this way.[N]

##C28EndingKenneth
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]
I see you've taken[N]
Elcorian alive.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]If you'd rather him dead,[N]
that's all the same to me.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I trust that you spared[N]
him for a reason.[A][N]
Do with him whatever you[N]
think is best.[A][N]
Just[...] leave me out of it.[A][N][OpenLeft]
But of course.[A][N]
Now, go. You've far[N]
more pressing matters.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Thank you, Kenneth.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Start talking. What would[N]
drive you to do all this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[...] you know how it feel to go[N]
your whole life doing nothing?[A][N]
Feeling like every accomplishment[N]
of yours is but a farce?[A][N]
I[...] had to do something to leave[N]
some mark on the world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Girard[...] always said that I[N]
had potential for anything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hmph. Blaming your actions[N]
on a man like him.[A][N]
[...]Have you considered that[N]
you may just be a scapegoat?[A][N]
Think about it. If word of this[N]
were to get out to the public,[A][N]
and it proved to be some manner[N]
of country-wide scandal,[A][N]
Arbordia could simply pin the[N]
blame on you.[A][N]
Of course, that wouldn't add up[N]
if this was truly your doing.[A][N]
So, who was really in control here?[N]
Did you truly want this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you[...] insinuating that my[N]
life's work isn't truly mine?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm insinuating that you've been[N]
a pawn in some grander scheme.[A][N]
[...]When did you discover this[...][N]
abominable technique?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Some months back, I found some[N]
documents from Girard.[A][N]
He claimed the research a dead end,[N]
but[...] It came so clearly to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]The idea of it being a dead end[N]
is simply laughable.[A][N]
The simulacra dragons we witnessed[N]
in Zeimstadt are proof of that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Girard[...] wouldn't miss as[N]
clear a connection as that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not unless he wanted to.[A][N]
[...]I think he fed this to you[N]
to do[...] Well, something.[A][N]
Whether that be bolster your[N]
confidence,[A] or wash himself[N]
of responsibility[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course, this is all[N]
pure speculation.[A][N]
There's only one person[N]
who can confirm all this.[A][N]
[...]Wouldn't you like to know[N]
if your life had meaning?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't get me wrong.[A][N]
Joining us will not clear[N]
your name in the least.[A][N]
You'd be lucky to again know[N]
freedom in your lifetime.[A][N]
If you try to run, I will hunt[N]
you to the ends of the earth.[A][N]
But wouldn't you like some kind[N]
of closure before the end?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You[...] are truly something.[A][N]
[...]Very well, Kenneth.[A][N]
I am yours to do with as you wish.[N]
Though it pains me[...][A][N]
I will see that what truth remains[N]
comes to light at last.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Come, then. I can't imagine[N]
you'll be popular among us,[A][N]
but everyone ought to know[N]
your place.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Girard[...] Please[...] Please let[N]
this theory be wrong.[A][N]
[...]It[...] must be false.[N]
[...]It[...] can't be.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]
I see you've taken[N]
Elcorian alive.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I'm[...] sorry.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I know this[...] still must[N]
be very hard for you.[A][N]
[...]Do with him whatever you[N]
think is best.[A][N]
Just[...] leave me out of it.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Take care of[N]
yourself, Blair.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Thank you, Emile.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What[...] What even is there[N]
left to say to you?[A][N]
Why[...] would you do this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[...] you know how it feel to go[N]
your whole life doing nothing?[A][N]
Feeling like every accomplishment[N]
of yours is but a farce?[A][N]
I[...] had to do something to leave[N]
some mark on the world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
There's[...] more ways to change[N]
the world than sweeping discoveries.[A][N]
The small things you've done matter[N]
far more than you could ever know.[A][N]
[...]Would you call all you've done[N]
for me nothing? A farce?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] still don't know if it's[N]
too late for you or not.[A][N]
But I[...] I can't just give[N]
up hope. That's not who I am.[A][N]
You[...] You say you do this all[N]
for some kind of future.[A][N]
Can you not entrust that future[N]
to us? Do you not believe?[A][N]
What reasons would you have to[N]
take away our agency in this?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I[...] Girard believes that[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I said you. Not Girard.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Are you simply following along[N]
with this plan for Girard?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've[...] seen what we can do.[A][N]
All the amazing things that we[N]
have proven capable of.[A][N]
Couldn't you place your trust[N]
in that[...] in us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][OpenEyes]I[...] am so very tired of[N]
standing against you.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps[...] it is time for[N]
something different.[A][N]
I[...] I need to know if this[N]
conflict was truly needed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I know Girard's done much for[N]
you. I am[...] sorry for this.[A][N]
For dragging you against him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It is an untenable choice.[A][N]
And that is why I must know if[N]
it needs to be a choice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] I don't think you'll have[N]
many a friend in our group.[A][N]
Or that you'll be treated with[N]
grace after this is over.[A][N]
But still[...] I am[...] glad.[A][N]
[...]I must report to the others.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Girard[...] Was this all[...][N]
What was it for?[A][N]
[...]Was it for anything?[A][X]

##C28EndingSimone
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadSimone][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]
I see you've taken[N]
Elcorian alive.[A][N][OpenLeft]
And I can change that[N]
in an instant.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]If you think he might[N]
know something, so be it.[A][N]
Do with him whatever you[N]
think is best.[A][N]
Just[...] leave me out of it.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course, of course.[A][N]
Now, run off. Don't[N]
worry yourself with me.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Good luck, Simone.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Don't give me your sob story.[A][N]
Your lack of self-worth's hardly[N]
a worthwhile excuse.[A][N]
[...]I'll give it to you straight.[N]
Nothing at Jraeyan matters.[A][N]
I've known that for many years[N]
now.[A] Mainly stuck around out[N]
of misplaced sentimentality.[A][N]
And I think now's the time for[N]
you to cut yourself out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've done nothing special or[N]
unique.[A] Those simulacrums?[N]
They're a Zeimstadt staple.[A][N]
[...]If it makes you feel better,[N]
nothing there was special.[A][N]
All of Jraeyan just aimed to[N]
replicate the past.[A][N]
And all of Jraeyan produced[N]
hollow drivel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You seem unhappy that I'm tearing[N]
into your life's work like this.[A][N]
But from a certain point of view,[N]
it's not even yours.[A][N]
Of course, then that begs the[N]
questions[...][A] What ever[N]
have you offered the world?[A][N]
Anything?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[...] Is adapting knowledge[N]
to a new age not valuable?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's valuable if it actually[N]
means a damn.[A][N]
If one can look at it and think[N]
that it'll improve their life.[A][N]
[...]But that all is beyond my point.[A][N]
You've stood for nothing but hollow[N]
and ancient ideals for years.[A][N]
Wouldn't you like to stand for[N]
something real?[A] Something[N]
that's your own?[A][N]
If you want to leave your mark[N]
on the world.[A] you need to[N]
survive this conflict.[A][N]
And I think you'll only survive[N]
if you fight under me.[A][N]
[...]Do I make myself clear?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Girard[...][A]{N][OpenMidLeft]
What of him? He's the same[N]
as the rest in my eyes.[A][N]
Besides, I bet he's been leading[N]
you along all these years.[A][N]
Any disccovery you've made, he[N]
could've too. Anyone could've.[A][N]
And yet, he let you feel like[N]
you've done something grand.[A][N]
Why would that be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Stir on that. I should go[N]
report to Aercolyn.[A][N]
[...]Remember your place.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Girard[...] She must[...] be wrong[...][A][N]
You wouldn't[...] deceive me[...][N]
after all this time[...][A][N]
[...]I must[...] know[...][A][X]

##C28Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] I know I never[N]
knew you.[A] Maybe this isn't[N]
my tragedy to grieve.[A][N]
[...]I know you all deserved[N]
better than this. Than me.[A][N][OpenEyes][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
[...]Even to the end[...][N]
Evevn to this end.[A][N]
You're still holding onto[N]
your bow so steadfast.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]You[...] You can rest now.[A][N]
I'll[...] finish this for you.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Did[...] Did your grip just[N]

[...]Girard's office. It's[...] empty.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Not quite. There's[...] another of[N]
those crystals on his desk.[A][N]
Like the ones from Jraeyan.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenRight][ToggleInvert]
Lady Aercolyn. Prince Couria. If you[N]
are listening, I commend you.[A][N]
Clearly, if you were able to overcome[N]
Elcorian's creations,[A] you two are[N]
no mere upstarts.[A][N]
Even so, my- our vision for the future[N]
is not so easily disrupted.[A][N]
As you have certainly seen by now,[N]
even life itself is in our grasp.[A][N]
[...]It's truly a shame to think of all[N]
that has happened.[A] All that you have[N]
done to pave your path forward.[A][N]
But I believe it may be in our best[N]
interest to let bygones be bygones.[A][N]
[...]Behind my desk are devices of magic[N]
almost beyond comprehension.[A][N]
Teleportation devices.[A][N]
Capable of transporting almost all[N]
that one could imagine.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps including an army.[A][N]
For tranparency's sake, the inactive[N]
device takes one to Fort Jraeyan.[A][N]
The active device takes one to a[N]
balcony in the Tower of Opistus.[A][N]
The top of the world, so to speak.[N]
It's a lovely place to think.[A][N]
[...]And a fitting place for us to[...][N]
Well, that's truly your call.[A][N]
We can walk away as[...] Well,[N]
something close to equals.[A][N]
Or we can kill each other.[A][N]
I believe that either way, the[N]
fate of all Dalst is at stake.[A][N]
[...]And I believe that Dalst is the[N]
most important place in Ulmaron.[A][N]
It wouldn't be hyperbole to say that[N]
Ulmaron's future, and indeed,[A][N]
the world's future, will be decided.[A][N]
The choice is truly in your hands.[N]
Until then[...] I await you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleInvert]
[...]I don't think there's anything[N]
else to say.[A] Are you prepared?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been prepared to end this[N]
for far too long now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright, everyone. Gather close.[N]
This[...] will be our final battle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Everyone's in the device's[N]
range, then?[A] [...]Let's go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Activating[...][A][MoveMidLeft] now.[A][X]

##C28Ending4

We won't hand our future[N]

Neillstrom.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's Kenneth, Elcorian.[A][N]
I see you're already trying[N]
to fast-track your demise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is such a temper truly one[N]
fit to succeed your father?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My father? Who, to my understanding,[N]
slew an unarmed prisoner?[A][N]
Who mindlessly fought to his death[N]
in the name of Arbordia?[A][N]
A drunkard could do his work[N]
better than he did.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]And yet, he kept the status quo.[N]
Dalst ran smoothly.[A] Our defense[N]
ran smoothly.[A] You and Aercolyn[N]
are the ones rocking the boat.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If freeing Dalst from its corruption's[N]
what you call rocking the boat,[A][N]
then sure. I'll gladly sink this[N]
entire country.[A] Better than what[N]
you and Arbordia are doing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Speak out rashly. See what this[N]
land is like in twenty years.[A][N]
[...]Or perhaps not. Perhaps you[N]
shall fall today.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think not.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Can you live with losing[N]
our knowledge forever, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sure. And[...] if not[...][N]

How is this saving anybody?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You don't see the potential[N]

It's not unlike a sight we[N]

A Yg'stran, seemingly clinging[N]

Ah, right. I had presented him[N]
to Tarquin as a proof of concept.[A][N]
[...]Evidently, he was a failure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
If he was one, who's to say[N]
these mercenaries won't be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And if they are, I shall[N]
refine them again and again.[A][N]
They have many lives they can[N]

drove you to leave us.[A][N]
From my understanding, you[N]
had all you could ever want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, sure. Subjects, science,[N]
cramped halls, all that.[A][N]
But it was missing something.[N]
Took me a long time to notice.[A][N]
[...]Meaning.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Meaning?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've deluded yourselves into thinking[N]
that prodding corpses is an artform.[A][N]
That if something works in the most[N]
perfectly controlled circumstances,[A][N]
it'll somehow just[...] work everywhere.[N]
[...]I simply did what I had to.[A][N]
I left to track down a subject that[N]
escaped many years back.[A][N]
To prove my methods superior.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Don't pretend you've any[N]
real stake in this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

This is what I get for[N]
humoring you with words.[A][N]
Frustrated self-righteous[N]
grandstanding.[A][N]
[...]I think it's about time I[N]
see if I can kill you.[A][N]
Or better yet, if I can't[N]
kill you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

feel responsible.[A][N]
For what happened to them.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]That's hardly cause to[N]
be distraught.[A][N]
The way I understand it,[A][N]
your actions let them be[N]
this.[A] Let them become[N]
the warriors of our future.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][CloseEyes]
[...]You will never understand.[N]
Evidently.[A][N]
[...]And this is why we must[N]
stand against you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
Then stand. Fight.[A][N]
If you wish to prove[N]
your ideals worthy,[A][N]
trample mine beneath you.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianYuyuBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu]
[...]Die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Pleasant.[N]
And, I refuse.[A][N]
You who are the fruit[N]
of our knowledge-[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu]
I wasn't asking.[A][N]
[...]Die.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Myrmidon. Spare me[N]
your ramblings.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
I shall spare you only of[N]
your forsakable head.[A][N]
Mine ashen blade shall[N]
rend your soul in twain.[A][N]
Infinite your pain shall be that[N]
not even kings could endure![A][N]
There will be no absolution[N]
for your innumerable sins![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Sins? Sins they may be,[N]
they are necessary.[A][N]
But you have long been a[N]
man beyond reason.[A][N]
It was a fruitless endeavor[N]
to even try.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianSimoneBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]This'll be fun.[A][N]
You're a wretch, Elcorian.[N]
And now I get to break you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
I never trusted in your[N]
supposed loyalty, Simone.[A][N]
I've long been prepared to[N]
come into conflict.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Oh, really? Then hopefully[N]
you're prepared to suffer.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Surveil. I thought I[N]
caught wind of you.[A][N]
Someone mentioned an eye[N]
back in Couria.[A][N]
To think it's you.[A][N]
And that something like[N]
you could do[...] this.[A][N]
Perhaps I underestimated[N]
what you truly are.[A][N]
[...]I will not once again[N]
make that mistake.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianDalstianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
I take no pleasure in[N]
cutting down one of Dalst.[A][N]
But if you choose to stand[N]
in my way,[A] cut down you[N]
will be all the same.[A][N]
Cut down for the sake[N]
of our ideals.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianViridiansBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Did you perhaps know[N]
those mercenaries?[A][N]
Were you perhaps one of[N]
their numbers?[A][N]
I've brought them back[N]
for you.[A] I believe[N]
you should be grateful.[A][N]
[...]If not, perhaps you then[N]
shall be our next subject.[A][N]
We'll harness your power[N]
just as theirs.[A][N]
All you've thought shall[N]
soon be surpassed.[A][X]

##C28Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
This place is[...][N]
Well, it's huge.[A][N]
Any idea where Arbordia[N]
and Elcorian may be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've got no clue. But we have[N]
the perimeter surrounded.[A][N]
Unless they can warp outside,[N]
there's nowhere they can run.[A][N]
[...]And if they do warp away,[N]
we can prepare for their return.[A][N]
For now, let's make our way up the[N]
hall.[A] [...]Be ready for anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right behind you.[N]
All the way.[A][X]

##C28Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke][OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]So, you've arrived.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I know it's pointless to ask now,[A][N]
but I presume you still have no[N]
intention of joining us?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Who[...] Who do you think[N]
you're saving like this?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Sacrifice the few for[N]
the many.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You talk as if the world's[N]
going to end.[A] What leads[N]
you to think that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It won't end in an instant.[A][N]
But left unchecked, society[N]
will decay. Crumble.[A][N]
Chaos will reign unless we[N]
take measures to-[A][N][OpenLeft]
Will reign? In how long?[A][N]
[...]Fear that one day the world[N]
might be beyond saving[...][A][N]
Whatever that even means[...][A][N]
That's hardly justification to[N]
throw away our lives today.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And you'd condemn tomorrow?[A][N][OpenLeft]
There's a difference between[N]
tomorrow and the future.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course I want what's best[N]
for the Ulmaron of tomorrow.[A][N]
But all the future is not the[N]
responsibility of a single day.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But[...] To be the saviors[N]
of the untold infinite[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What have you even done[N]
to become that savior?[A][N]
All we've been witness to[N]
is your destruction.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I've made exceedingly clear,[N]
sacrifice is a necessary evil.[A][N]
Perhaps you two are simply far[N]
too idealistic to understand.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]No. You're simply too absorbed by[N]
your delusion that you've done good.[A][N]
The way I understand it, no good[N]
can come out of your actions.[A][N]
In your terms, no future worth[N]
fighting for.[A] And so, we'll[N]
stop you here and now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Deny all we've[N]
done.[A] [...]I'll show you the[N]
shepherds of our future.[A][X]

##C28Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ToggleInvert][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]I believe you may be[N]
familiar with this one.[A][N]
Their entire group has proven[N]
to be very worthy subjects.[A][N]
Proof of my concept.[A][N]
But you've proven yourselves[N]
hardly into my rigor.[A][N]
[...]In any case, none of this[N]
matters.[A] My duty is to hold[N]
you off for Girard.[A][N]
Every moment you spend here[N]
brings him further away.[A][N]
[...]If you turn back, so be it.[N]
But if you intend to advance[...][A][N]
I[...] We will hold back nothing.[A][N]
[...]The first move is yours.[N]
Make your choice.[A][N]
Just know that your time is[N]
slipping away fast.[A][X]

##C28Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So this is[...] I'm[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[...] haven't done anything.[N]
None of this is your fault.[A][N]
He's just trying to throw us off.[N]
It[...] It might hurt to do.[A][N]
[...]But all we can do now is[N]
bring end to their sorrow.[A][N]
[...]And to Elcorian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're[...][A][OpenEyes] You're right. We can't[N]
afford to delay long.[A][N]
Best case, we lose Arbordia.[N]
Worst case[...] I don't know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We've overcome much to get here.[A][N]
However great the Viridian Mercenaries[N]
were[...][A][CloseEyes] It's our duty to give[N]
to them their deserved rest.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Viridian disappeared, but Elcorian's[N]
still standing right there.[A][N]
Should[...] we be concerned?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]No. There's nothing more to say[N]
to him or do for him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[A][CloseEyes] [...]Forgive[N]
me for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You still don't need to be[N]
forgiven.[A] You made the best[N]
choice with what we knew.[A][N]
[...]And we may be here now if[N]
not for that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Onwards, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Onwards, everyone![A][X]

##C28Turn1
[OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]So, you choose to fight.[N]
Regrettable, truly.[A][N]
Treasure what little time[N]
you have left.[A][N]
And know that what is about to[N]
happen to you is your doing.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
I[...] do not regret my choices.[A][N]
The sins I've committed are all[N]
in the name of the future.[A][N]
If you deny this future,[N]
there can be no parley.[A][N]
[...]Come, then. Let our[N]
ideals clash.[A][X]

Everything you've given.[N]
Everything you've taken.[A][N]
This is exactly what you've[N]
come to deserve, Elcorian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]

Prove that you have the[N]

I simply think you'll[N]
be a valuable asset.[A][N]
Perhaps you wished to die[N]
here instead.[A][N]
Perhaps you'll wish you[N]
died here.[A][N]
[...]But there will be no[N]
escaping justice.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]

##Ch28_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungElcorian][OpenMidLeft]
You're doing well, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you say so, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You still have doubts on[N]
your mind. Lay yourself bare.[A][N]
I truly do wish to clear up[N]
anything clouding you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] I don't deserve any of this.[A][N]
I still feel like nothing more than[N]
an outsider.[A][CloseEyes] Why[...] What have I[N]
done to earn any of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You are a brilliant young man.[A][N]
There is no need for you to doubt[N]
your intellect or your station.[A][N]
[...]I've been meaning to give you something[N]
for some time now.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]A sword?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More a symbollic prop than anything.[A][N]
You surely know of Arbordia's relic,[N]
the Foundation.[A] Well, that's only[N]
half of the story.[A] It's a truth[N]
lost to time,[A] but the Foundation was[N]
created by the founding lord of Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you mean, lost to time?[N]
The founding lord was Ar-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aercolyn. [...]That's where the truth[N]
has since been muddled.[A][N]
The founding Arbordia was a dear[N]
friend of the founding Aercolyn.[A][N]
As a show of goodwill, Aercolyn[N]
crafted a sword beyond wonder.[A][N]
[...]This blade. The Creator.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] exquisite.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Some generations back, the Foundation[N]
was stolen, the Creator was hidden,[A][N]
and the story of Dalst was entirely[N]
rewritten.[A] Part of me had considered[N]
eventually bringing that truth to light.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But then[...][N]
Sinclair von Aercolyn[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]His legacy deserves[N]
nothing now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Still[...] Did he not[N]
have a daughter?[A][N]
Does she not deserve to[N]
one day learn this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose that depends.[A][N]
Will she repent for her father's[N]
ruinous legacy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[...] Is it her place to?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. Perhaps not.[A][N]
[...]Why does this interest you so?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Pity, I suppose. She may very well[N]
forever be outcast from Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you are hardly outcast, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me. Just[...] give it time.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Your place is with us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This blade[...] The Creator. I entrust[N]
it to you as proof of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] Are you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is a blade nobody has seen[N]
for many decades.[A] It will[N]
hardly make much fuss.[A][N]
Keep it at your side and know that[N]
you deserve to be where you are.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Thank you, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Elcorian.[N]
Now, then. Let us be off.[A][N]
You still have infinite[N]
potential within you.[A][X]
