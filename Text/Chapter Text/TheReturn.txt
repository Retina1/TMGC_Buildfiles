This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This might be wrong of me to say,[N]
but you two are family to me too.[A][N]
We've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been through hell together.[N]
And that's nothing of the ones lost.[A][N]
But on my life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You two will[N]
survive. You must.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right back at you, Dean.[N]
You're not dying on us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll make it out of here, and then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, you can introduce us to your kids![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I like the sound of that.[N]
But first, the battle awaits.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Isn't it obvious? We have to[N]
help them! It's our duty![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As mercenaries?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As people, brother![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was just a trick question.[N]
We've a job, and they paid.[A][N]
Eyes up, both of you.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No time for doubts now.[N]
Stay close to me, sister.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I can handle myself.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If we're done here, then let[N]
us proceed onwards.[A][N][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Leading them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It still feels[N]
wrong. But I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm all they have.)[A][X]

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
So, what now? We charge?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
That's dangerous, brother.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We must.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Never expected you to say that, Eliza.[N]
Guess something's rubbed off on you.[A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can't afford to[N]
be afraid, now.[A][N][OpenRight]
She's right. It's do-or-die. And, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Many good people have died.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, let's make them mean something.[A][N]
Absurd as it is, we're in this[N]
together, until the end.[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we'll die.[N]
I'm not gonna let that happen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

Now's not the time for your jokes, Wilhelm.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are we sure we trust them?[N]
After[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] everything?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Suppose they were the ones who laid the trap.[N]
We're still mercenaries.[A] If they pay,[N]
we do their job. That's the way it goes.[A][N][OpenRight]
You've spent your life in the arena,[N]
and NOW you consider a risk?[A][N]
That's alarmingly out of character.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it.[A][OpenEyes] You're right.[N]
Besides[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thinking about it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We saw that girl, too. On the streets[N]
of Mevion. Must've been months ago.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe there's more than luck[N]
to our encounters with her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look, are you two going to debate, or[N]
are you going to do your duty?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't believe I've gotta be[N]
the serious one now.[A][N][OpenRight]
Apologies, Wilhelm. I'll show the world[N]
my true skills.[A][CloseEyes] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For Viridian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For Viridian![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's the spirit.[A][N][CloseEyes]

Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We'll paint the Lowlands red.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A marriage of crimson and ash.[N]
Sounds quite remarkable.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Weird kid. But that does[N]
sound like a sight to behold.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What beauty is there here?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hey, she started it. And if[N]
she sees it,[A] and if it keeps[N]

That's just who I am. I create[N]

beautiful of it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think that's our hint[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Give them hell.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Succinct, I see. Well, I suppose[N]
more detail would be redundant.[A][N]
We shall indeed give them hell.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Glad we've settled that.[A][N]
Hell is no less than what they[N]
all deserve.[A][N]

And then we'll do our duty[N]
to those who're fallen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Agreed.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Excellent, Wilhelm. It's time[N]
to make an entrance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then let's do it.[A][N][OpenRight]
Patience. What's our plan, boss?[A][N]
We must make the most of this chance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hadn't much of a plan.[N]

Unless you've got anything better.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Well, then.[N]
Improvisation.[A][N]
I'm fine with that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do my thing.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm as ready as I believe[N]
I could ever be.[A][N]
I know you're not much of[N]
one for fighting, Estelle.[A][N]
I'm impressed how well you've[N]
risen to this role.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

wandering specks of dust.[A][N]
Only by standing as one[N]
can we survive,[A][N]
and only through leadership[N]
can we all stand together.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well said.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

We dazzle them, my friend.[A][N][OpenRight]

Use our skills to take down[N]
the baddies.[A] While impressing[N]

fight like normal.[A][N]

Do as you wish.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. You two shall[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. Time to strike, then.[N]
The catharsis of a blade.[A][N][OpenRight]
A daring clash in the darkest[N]
of moonless nights[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
A scene truly beyond compare.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to wax poetic. It's what[N]
it is. Mercenary work.[A][N]
Kill or be killed.[A][N]
We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] still alive, and if we're[N]
not careful, that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah. That's obvious.[A][N]

a downer, Wilhelm.[A][N]

of joy with this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies. I suppose[N]
it is something.[A][N]
Even if it's just a lie[N]
to give yourself purpose.[A][N]

before I ruin the mood more.[A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleCallumArgent

Whatever gets you through[N]
this, young one.[A][N]

It's alright. We'll have to[N]
tear them to shreds anyway,[A][N]
if we wish to help that[N]

May as well relish in it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose. Still, don't[N]
let your guard down a second.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll be fine. I swear.[N]
This isn't my time to die.[A][N][OpenRight]

If you two have concluded[N]
your little comedy,[A][N]
I believe it is time for[N]

Ha! Of course.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Rare for you to be the[N]
focused one.[A] But I[N]
can appreciate it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's our final act. The time[N]
to pull out all the stops.[A][N]
Bravely walk into the light[N]
and seize our destiny.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll seize something, alright.[N]
Destiny, revenge[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

Our superior range would be worth[N]
utilizing.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even so, I must[N]
go on ahead.[A][N]
Keep the two of you behind me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Frankly, staying in the backlines[N]
sounds like a grand waste.[A][N]

Now's not the time to take[N]
things slowly and hide.[A][N]
Now's the time to unleash[N]
everything we've got.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

Special's pushing it for me.[N]
But I guess you're something else.[A][N]
I'm sure no other actor's been[N]
through something like this.[A][N]
It'll make[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] interesting[N]
inspiration.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course. All of life's[N]

They guide my performances.[A][N]
This is hell, but I can make[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Great. Before you get lost[N]
in thoughts,[A] let's make sure[N]
we can actually do our job.[A][N][OpenRight]

Yes, boss! Channel that rage[N]
into your sword![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can we begin?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah. Right. Go on, and kill[N]

from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Let's go.[A][N][OpenRight]
Keeping things brief.[N]
I like that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Whew. Someone's enthusiastic.[N]
Well, then.[A] Better keep a[N]
close eye on ya'.[A][N]
Wouldn't want you to die.[N]
The others would haunt me.[A][N][OpenRight]
Don't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worry. I'll be fine.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yup. I hear your silence[N]
loud and clear.[A][N]
Time to begin, fellas.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Here we are.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate that all[N]
has come to this.[A][N]
Youths like you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] suffering[N]
through all of this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whatever time I've got left[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I swear I'll make a better world.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]T-thank you. Miss Argent.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's get on with this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. I'll keep you[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadRose][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Send you in. See what[N]
happens. You'll be fine.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Send me in instead.[N]
I could use the practice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was rhetorical.[A][N]
We'll do what we've been[N]
doing. Stick together.[A][N]
Stay in the shadows.[N]
Stay alive.[A][N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the least we[N]
could give the others.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine by me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I do prefer the[N]
two of you alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A fifteen year old prefers me[N]
to not be dead.[A] Truly, this[N]
is the culmination of my life.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Enough about that, though.[N]
Onwards, you two![A][N]
Time to fulfill our duty![A][X]

##Ch24_RoseCallumWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still not one for[N]
your comedic bits, boss.[A][N]
Sorry to say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought it was funny.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No need to flatter me, kid.[N]
But that's beyond the point.[A][N]
Joke or not, we've got some[N]
manner of duty to perform.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Funny that it's us three.[N]
The least dutybound I know.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's a chance to let my[N]
sword do its thing.[A][N]
That's enough for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been nice to me.[N]
I'll keep helping you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Guess that leaves me, then.[A][N]
I'll just say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm here[N]
for a friend.[A][N]
A friend who'd tell me to shut[N]
the hell up and get fightin'.[A][N]
So. Let's get fightin'.[A][X]

##Ch24_RoseCallumArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm beyond hell these days.[N]
But I sure can raise something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hell sounds fun about now.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! At least someone's[N]
enthusiastic about this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Those bastards took lots[N]
from us.[A][N]
So we'll just have to beat[N]
them all that much worse.[A][N]
Sure, retribution might[N]
be a waste of our time.[A][N]
But it'll feel so good.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's save it for helping[N]
our client.[A][N]
I can't say I don't appreciate[N]
the enthusiasm, at least.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] show me who to[N]
roast, boss.[A][N][OpenRight]
It'd be an honor, kid.[A][X]

Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly, friend. What a cruel[N]
mistress time is.[A][N]
How are you holding up, child?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm afraid.[N]
To die like they did.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's just the lot we're given.[N]
Life's a bitch like that.[A][N]
We face death every day.[N]
Convince ourselves it means something.[A][N][OpenRight]
Do you have a point, or do you mean[N]
to scar the child further, Wilhelm?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whoops.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's just get going.[A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
Well, if you say so. Manfred?[N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been an honor.[A][N][OpenRight]
It'll be an honor for many[N]
more years, friend.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
Why do you ask us? You are[N]
the one in command here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look. Back me up here.[A][N][OpenRight]
Apologies. I believe we[N]
ought to converge with her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rose?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Me? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a good idea.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
'Twas my plan too. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So we're[N]
all in agreement.[A][N]
I'm glad to hear.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, then. I'll keep the two[N]
of you safe.[A] You'll live to[N]
return to Opistia.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd rather not. But I[N]
appreciate the sentiment.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's just get on with this.[A][X]

##Ch24_RoseWilhelmArgent

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Your orders, young man?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to get so hasty.[N]
Obviously, we charge.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you ready, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yeah. Me neither.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Could you be slightly more[N]
encouraging, perhaps?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You seem to have that handled[N]
pretty well.[A] If you're making[N]
me lead, you can do morale.[A][N]
And the kid can be our mascot.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Mascot?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Something like that, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Please take this[N]
seriously.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Who's saying I'm not?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, anyway.[A][N]
Time to charge, you two.[N]
Stay alive. It'd be nice.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, mister.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Because you asked kindly.[A][X]

We raise hell. Thoughts[N]
on my plan?[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what they deserve.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Some old-fashioned wrath of[N]
the righteous?[A] Fair enough.[N]
Well, then. No need to dawdle.[A][N]
We've all people we'd like to[N]
avenge.[A] And joining them is[N]
how we'll achieve our vengeance.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go, then.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm behind you two all the way.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, charging ahead.[A][N]

We're raring to go.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Welp. No holding the two of[N]
you back.[A] Hell, not sure why[N]
I'm holding myself back.[A][N]
We're just three vengeful men[N]
with nothing left to lose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's a fine skill.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks. I think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
Ah. Right. On with this.[N]
Apologies.[A][N]
If I were one of you, I'd[N]
hate me for wasting time too.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not sure why I'm the[N]
one leading here.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It is not my place. And Dirk's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He's hurting.[A][N]
You're our most capable.[A][N][OpenRight]

Hearing that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][N]

Hit them where it hurts![A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][N][OpenRight]
You heard the kid. No comedy[N]
routine for us today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]All the same, then.[A][N]
There's no cutting this tension[N]
anyway.[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps later we can revel.[A][N]
But for now, we must do what[N]
we swore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Succinct. I agree. But it's[N]
up to you, Manfred.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Vengeance[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That sounds good[N]
right about now.[A][N]
We've been through hell.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]

Indeed we have.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And now, it's time we turn[N]
the tables.[A] Show them our[N]

I agree. Time's wasting as long[N]
as we're standing here.[A][N]
I've learned something from[N]
my many long years:[A][N]
You've gotta act.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] was my plan. Deliberation's[N]
never been me, either.[A][N]
Lived a life at the whim of[N]
the cards and the kingdom.[A][N]

we could hope.[A][N]
Better than either of us.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]

I've seen that look many times.[N]
Despondence. Indignation.[A][N]

get what you want.[A][N]
One way or another.[A][N][OpenRight]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is it, isn't it?[A][N]
Our last chance to make things right.[N]
To make good of the fallen.[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we seek vengeance.[N]
What is there to avenge?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now's not the time to question why[N]
we fight.[A] It's funny, really.[A][N]
Normally, I'd be all over finding[N]
some way to justify myself.[A][N]
But now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I understand.[A][N]
What it means to be a part of[N]
something bigger.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or maybe the ash has finally[N]
gotten to my brain.[A][N][OpenRight]
As always, you baffle us.[N]
But I see your meaning.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't, but I guess we're in[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's simple. We proceed in[N]
our assigned duty.[A][N]
To not would be to disgrace[N]
all the others fell for.[A][N][OpenRight]
Grace isn't my strong suit.[A][N]
But they're against the ones[N]
that took out the others.[A][N]
So it's an easy choice for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I figured as much.[A][N]
As acting leader, I just wanted[N]
to ensure we were of the same mind.[A][N][OpenRight]

You're doing good. Now, then.[N]
