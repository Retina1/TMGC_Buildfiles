##Ch15_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadElcorian]
So, you must be the young prince.[N]
It is good to see you well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Forgive my rudeness. I am Elcorian.[N]
A[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] peer of Blair's.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's nice to meet you.[A][N]
Did you need Lady Blair? I was[N]
just speaking with her.[A][N]
After all, my father had come to[N]
her aid.[A] Only feels right to[N]
get to know her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'll be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nice, having an[N]
ally in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. On the subject of allies,[A][N]
I believe that once we're all returned[N]
to Dalst, the High Council may convene.[A][N]
I trust you can guess for what purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that true? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] fantastic![A][N][OpenFarRight]
After all, Aercolyn's actions brought the[N]
war to a speedy end,[A] even if Elba Cor[N]
and Opistia's hands weighed the scales.[A][N]
Of course, these Opistus-forsaken postwar[N]
roundtables must come to an end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Hey, it's not my fault Yg'stra's all[N]
Dalst's problem now.[A][OpenEyes] Though I[N]
appreciate my not having to deal with it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If we're pinning this on anybody, it's[N]
Tarquin. I mean, Lord Neillstrom.[A][N]
And yet I'm the one drowning in paperwork.[A][N][OpenRight]
Alas. At least soon enough,[N]
this war will be behi-[A][N][Event][OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]
Your highness![A][N][OpenRight]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][Event]
A mysterious figure has appeared outside[N]
of the castle grounds![A][N]
They appear to be warping a legion[N]
of soldiers beyond the gate![A][N][OpenRight]
What do you mean?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Warping soldiers. That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
can't be good at all.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Come quickly, please![A][X]

##Ch15_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How are there so many[N]
of them?[A] For someone to warp such[N]
a large force[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't Lord Neillstrom not too far?[N]
Would he have troops with him?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Good thinking, Blair. I shall retrieve[N]
him as swiftly as I'm able.[A][N]
Until then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're just going to[N]
have to hold on. Apologies.[A][N][OpenRight]
It is alright.[A][X]

##Ch15_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadBrandl]
Zeke! Run off and hide, please.[N]
You must survive this.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm sorry, father. I can't do that.[N]
I must stand and fight.[A][N]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is my kingdom, now.[N]
What would I be if I cowered?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You truly are your father's son.[N]
Very well. Lady Blair![A][N]
Please, keep my son safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, your majesty.[A][N][OpenRight]
So, you're coming too, then?[N]
This isn't your fight.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's hardly true. Who knows why[N]
these soldiers are here?[A][N]
I can't leave loose ends like[N]
this in good conscience.[A][N][CloseEyes]
And, besides[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't want anyone[N]
to die because I ran again.[A][N][OpenRight]
Very well. We'll fight together.[N]
I gathered a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ragtag bunch.[A][N]
I trust you to lead them well.[N]
And of course, my lance is yours.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, your highness.[A][N]
You, your father, all of us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
We'll make it out of this alive.[A][X]

##Ch15_Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadBrandl][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is everyone alright?[N]
We should be safe for now.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we're fine. But who[N]
were those people, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hopefully we'll figure that out.[N]
Neillstrom's going to question the-[A][N][OpenRight]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I recognized them.[A][N]
If I'm not mistaken, they're Holanian.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How would you know that?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I lived in Holanis for over a decade?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ah. Forgive me. Carry on.[A][N][OpenRight]
Their dress was that of Holanis. And for[N]
their leader to hold such eldritch might[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Dark forces[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Could they have something[N]
to do with the Emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Perhaps. I've heard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] rumors,[N]
of a troubling sort.[A][N]
Have either of you encountered[N]
dragons of legend?[A][N][OpenLeft]
As a matter of fact, yes.[A][N][OpenRight]
Yeah, in the Yg'stran mountains.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Beasts that should be long absconded[N]
from history, returning to life.[A][N]
A shadowy presence, centered in[N]
a barren land.[A][N]
Could they be connected?[A][N][OpenRight]
Whether or not they are, we need[N]
to figure out our next move.[A][N]
If another attack of this magnitude[N]
happens, that could spell disaster.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we need to venture out.[N]
To Holanis.[A] That's the best bet[N]
we've got to solve these mysteries.[A][N]
That is, if you're alright with it.[A][N][OpenRight]
I cannot leave a threat to my homeland.[N]
Father, I apologize, but I must leave again.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I understand. Promise me[N]
you'll come back safe.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course, father.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Are you certain, Blair? Do you not[N]
wish to resolve matters with Dalst?[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'm sorry, but I'm set on this.[A][N]
Besides, just as Holanis may come back[N]
to threaten Elba Cor,[A] they too may[N]
threaten Dalst.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I must return.[N]
I wish you the best.[A][X]

##Ch15_GateUnlock
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadBrandl]
Did they just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]? This isn't good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If they got the gate open, who[N]
knows what else they can do?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're fine. We just need to[N]
stay alert. Anything can happen.[A][N]
On the bright side, their leader's[N]
exposed. They look dangerous,[A][N]
but if we take them out, that'll[N]
bring a swift end to this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Whatever you think is best.[A][X]

##Ch15_BridgeTime
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadBrandl]
Did[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] anyone else see that?[A][N][OpenRight]
Father! What's that bridge doing?[A][N]
Did the enemy just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
build it on the fly?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think I sense some lingering[N]
animus energies from it.[A][N]
Why would the enemy magic[N]
a bridge into existence?[A][N]
Do they aim to target your father?[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Or perhaps it's a diversion.[N]
Everyone! Be mindful from all directions![A][X]

##Ch15_NotOverYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is it over?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It can't be. Nobody would end[N]
an assault like this.[A][N]
Be careful. I fear the worst.[A][N][X]

##Ch15_IKingTrabant
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. This is quite bad.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Off in the distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I think I see a signal[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It must be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sir Elcorian![N]
Just hang on a bit longer, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We've come this far. I'm not[N]
giving up on Elba Cor now.[A][X]

##Ch15_ElcorianTheCamooIsHere
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
Leave it to me, Elcorian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My thanks, Tarquin.[A][N]
Blair! Get everyone to safety![N]
Dalst'll handle them![A][N][X]

##Ch15_ElcorianTheCamooIsHere2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom][OpenMidLeft]
Where did he[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. That's not important now.[N]
Take down the stragglers.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. I'll subdue them[N]
for questioning.[A][N]
Go make sure everyone is well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course.[A][X]

##Ch15_ElcorianTheCamooIsHereLate
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
We're here. Though, it seems[N]
they've handled things well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose so. Still, it never hurts[N]
to be safe.[A] If you could take[N]
down the stragglers, please.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. I'll subdue them[N]
for questioning.[A][N]
Go make sure everyone is well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Thank you.[A][X]

##C15BrandlDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this is it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm sorry, everyone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]At least[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I saw[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
him one last time[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
FATHER![A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This can't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C15BossBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUnknown]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Your life is forfeit.[N]
You cannot hope to triumph.[A][X]

##C15BossDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUnknown]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's enough from me.[N]
You cannot fight our will.[A][X]

##C15_Yuyu_Recruitment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who're you? You're not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
one of them, right?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a relief.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You can call me Yuyu.[A][N]
I think I can be of assistance.[N]
In fact[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I know I can be.[A][N]
I've got a talent like none other.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Some may call it a curse.[A][N]
Either way, it's bound to be of use.[N]
So please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Take me with you![A][X]
