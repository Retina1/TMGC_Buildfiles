[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]H-hello[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Sam, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that's correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, what did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] just wanted to[N]
ask about my technique.[A][N]
Y-you're a pretty fantastic[N]
sharpshooter, after all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm flattered, but you're quite[n]
skilled too.[A][N]
Don't sell yourself short.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. Even if you're lacking in sheer[N]
power, you make up in precision.[A][N]
I can't recall you missing any[N]
shots that've truly counted.[A][N]
I mean, we've not fought together[N]
long, but I doubt that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad you think highly of me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But you'll always be an unreachable[N]
goal for me to aspire to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks?[A][X]

Athena! Just who I wanted to see![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've got a wild proposition for you.[N]
Can I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hitch a ride?[A][N]
On your wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You see, though I hate to admit it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My armor leaves me a little[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] slow.[A][N]
I had hoped you could carry me to the[N]
frontlines, where I'd be effective.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. Hop on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yippee![A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
You seem excited.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To be frank, while there is of course[N]
strategic value to wyvern riding[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've also just always wanted to ride one.[N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thanks![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Actually, on second thought. Let's wait.[N]
Don't wanna overwhelm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What's the name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The name? Of the wyvern?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] personal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Well, perhaps after the battle,[N]
we can test their weight limit.[A][N]
I look forward to it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How was I supposed to know[N]
I needed to name you, friend?[A][X]

Mister Kenneth! I know your game![N]
You can't hide forever![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you still on that dark magic thing?[N]
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not just a thing, mister![A][N]
I've lost friends[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and even[N]
my family to dark magic![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, calamities brought upon[N]
by dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sorry to hear that. But I'd like[N]
you to understand something.[A][N]
I'm on your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hmph! You'll just have to prove that[N]
to me![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Back to the battle. I'll[N]
show you my brand of power.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why are you still here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't know. Why are[N]
YOU still here, woman?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a knight of Elba Cor.[N]
It's my duty to serve.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're wasting your life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do I even try with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, indeed? At least I know[N]
how messed up I am.[A][N]
You clearly think there's something[N]
worth saving in me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There isn't.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Go away, please.[A][X]

How have you been holding up,[N]
Bechamel?[A] Any luck with[N]
your learning?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, a bit. It be goin' slowly,[N]
but I think I got tha' basics.[A][N]
I'd show ya', but we be a bit[N]
busy fer that know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I'd be happy to see[N]
your progress after the battle.[A][N]
While you can obviously speak[N]
the modern tongue,[A][N]
learning to read written words is[N]
an entirely different experience.[A][N]
But you're a clever man. More so[N]
than you yourself believe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ye flatter me, mate.[N]
Well, take care then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You too, friend.[A][X]
