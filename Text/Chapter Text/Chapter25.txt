are[...] disgraced.[A][N]
One by one man, one by[N]
a history of stagnation.[A][N]
And today, one shall rise.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Dalst doesn't have your[N]
best interests at heart.[A][N]
This fight[...] isn't worth it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert]

But you won't shake me.[A][N]

Don't worry, Barford.[A][N]

[...]Well, there's a face I[N]
never thought I'd see.[A][N]
How's second place[N]
been treating you?[A][N][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert]
Wipe that smirk off your[N]
face, Charley.[A][N]
Perhaps you once were a better[N]
shot than I.[A] But I've spent[N]
many moons training.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
[...]So have I. That's[...][N]
how you improve.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert]
You know what I mean.[A][N]
I'm now a more than worthy[N]
rival to you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
[...]Sure.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert]
We're far beyond mere[N]
competition now, anyway.[A][N]
Today, we shoot for blood.[N]

I'll be the greatest shot[N]
in all the land![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]

##Ch25_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungEthyl]
[...]You seem fixated on something.[N]
[...]It's that look in your eyes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Apologies, Ethyl. I'm still caught[N]
up in the[...] abusrdity of it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That drivel about Holanis's[N]
ancient dragons?[A][N]
[...]You're a reasonable man.[N]
And that's all fantasy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I returned to Jraeyan again.[A][N]
I found[...] one of them.[N]
An artificial dragon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]And?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They truly can create life.[A][N]
It's not just delusions of[N]
a madman playing god.[A][N]
[...]There might be value in seeking[N]
out what we scattered.[A][N]
Offering them a proposal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd work alongside those[N]
vile scholars?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's for the lasting[N]
prosperity of Dalst[...][A][N]
I'd gladly hoist that burden.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm just concerned how quickly[N]
you changed your tune.[A][N]
The same people who were madmen under[N]
Sinclair will now be our future.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Such is the power of a[N]
strong guiding hand.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand your trepidation.[A][N]
But I truly believe leveraging[N]
these scholars is in our interest.[A][N]
The world's on the brink of change.[N]
We need to ensure our stability.[A][N]
The power and knowledge within those[N]
walls might just do that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]If you insist.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Well. Let's not lose[N]
any more time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're coming? Just like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know your decision's unshakeable now.[A][N]
But you still need someone looking[N]
out for you.[A] Besides[...] I won't[N]
lie and say I'm not interested.[A][N]
From the notes I've read so far,[N]
there's some[...][A] Well, interesting projects.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And they shall serve our needs.[N]
The needs of our land.[A][X]

##C25BobertSamTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBobert][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
[...]Brother[...] Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Samantha. I presume you[N]
understand why I'm here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'd[...] rather not fight you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, well. Arbordia willed it so.[N]
And this is Barford's chance.[A][N]
Every one of your siblings has[N]
failed our house.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]You can still come back.[N]
There's a place for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] can't. Not[...][N]
after this.[A][N]
I've[...] grown, Brother.[N]
If I must, I'll face you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Very well.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Perhaps your leaving was[N]
what you needed, after all.[A][N]
I'm[...] glad for you. And glad[N]
I got to see you again.[A][N]
I see you use the bow.[N]
[...]Good choice.[A][N]
Guess it runs in the family.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've carried this around far too long.[A][N]
It's[...] a keepsake of Father's.[A][N]
He gave it to me years back.[N]
But I've never used it.[A][N]
Did I want to prove myself[N]
on my own terms? Perhaps.[A][N]
[...]In any case[...] You might[N]
as well have it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Come. It's time to fulfill[N]
our duties, Sister.[A][N]
Prove to me your new resolve![A][X]
