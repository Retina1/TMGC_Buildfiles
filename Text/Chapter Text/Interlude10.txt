Ah, milady! I see you're well.[A][N]
Say, do you need some extra[N]
clothes?[A] I've got an old[N]
robe I've long outgrown.[A][N]
Shame to have to give it away.[N]
It's a real nice silk.[A][N]
But it's taking up space, and[N]
I'm sure you'll wear it well.[A][N]
[...]Or at the very least, you know[N]
someone it'll fit.[A][X]

Lady Blair has returned![N]
Praise be![A][N]
Is there anything you need?[N]
I'm sure you need funds.[A][N]
Well, some guy tried giving[N]
me this gemstone.[A][N]
Said it was a symbol of love.[N]
I didn't feel the same way.[A][N]
[...]He refused to take it back,[N]
so it's just been rotting here.[A][N]
I'm sure it's worth something![A][N]
[...]Don't take me giving this over[N]
as a symbol of love, of course.[A][N]
It's just a stone.[A][X]

Things have been running[N]
quite alright without you.[A][N]
Then again, I guess you could[N]
say it's been that way for years.[A][N]
The world kept turning when you[N]
were a tiny child, after all.[A][N]
Course, that means the taxes keep[N]
turning too.[A] [...]Not that I'm[N]
complaining, of course![A][N]
They're very[...] reasonable.[A][X]

I've kept an eye on the shops here.[A][N]
They stock almost everything you[N]
could ever want to buy.[A][N]
Especially the ones lined outside[N]
of your abode.[A] There's truly[N]
no better place in the world to shop.[A][N]
So if you have a dangerous mission[N]
ahead, don't underprepare.[A][N]
There's no reason to.[A][X]

Your Majesty! I wasn't[N]
expecting you to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's good to see you've made it.[A][N]
Elba Cor's pegasi have been keeping[N]
watch of your return.[A][N]
We know the great ordeal you face.[A][N]
If my son will continue to aid you,[N]
so too shall the kingdom of Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm truly glad to hear that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
On that note, if you see Hyperius,[N]
please present him this blade.[A][N]
During the Holanian expedition, I had[N]
dug up an old favorite of his.[A][N]
As thanks for his service, I had[N]
it reforged.[A] Alas, I'm not sure[N]
where he went off to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll get it to him. Don't worry.[A][N]
Do try and make time for him,[N]
though. He's served us well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Surely. There are many people I[N]
must commend while we're all here.[A][N]
Now, then. I won't keep you long.[N]
Go and do what you must.[A][X]

[OpenQuote][...]For my lovely lady. Let our[N]

Mine wits and skill have crafted[N]
a sword worthy of you.[A][N]
I name it Hopesinger. Let it[N]
protect that which you hold dear.[A][N]
Your homeland. Your husband.[N]
Your newborn daughter.[A][N]
[...]I shall be off to Holanis.[N]
But I will come back to you.[CloseQuote][A][N]
[...]So this was a gift for Mother.[A][N]
[...]And this is the other note.[A][N]
[OpenQuote][...]She left. She left me.[A][N]
Let that be your lesson, child.[N]
You're the only one you can trust.[A][N]
[...]If I am gone when you find this,[N]
then I am vindicated.[A][N]
Do as you wish with this blade.[N]
It is worthless to me now.[CloseQuote][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]You're wrong. My bonds got me[N]
to where I am now.[A][N]
[...]I hardly knew you, but I know[N]
I won't repeat your mistakes.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]This sword will lead Dalst[N]
out of the shadows. I swear it.[A][X]
