Ah... It's quite nice to have[N]
some respite from battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed. I'd use this time wisely[N]
to explore the city.[A] This would also[N]
be a good time to shop a bit.[A][N]
You can talk to people and visit[N]
buildings much like a normal battle...[A][N]
Wait, why am I explaining all this?[N]
This is second nature to you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's alright. The flow of battle is...[N]
different.[A] Almost makes peace seem[N]
unnatural by comparison![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Heh... I guess you're right.[A][N]
Well, when you're done, come find me.[A][X]

##I1PeterTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
A young lass new to the city?[A][N]
Don't worry- I don't bite.[A][N]
..Can't say the same about[N]
old Darahan, here.[A][N]
I'd stand back if I were you.[A][X]

##I1PtolemyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
H-Hello there... I'm Ptolemy...[N]
The flowers here a-are quite lovely.[A][N]
I wonder what my bee friends would[N]
think of them...[A][N]
You don't see them out here in Mevion much...[N]
Where I'm from, the bees are everywhere.[A][N]
it's something truly delightful to behold.[A][N]
Maybe if I spread more flowers, the bees[N]
will come here, too.[A][N]
Oh... Sorry for going on like that.[N]
Here, have this.[A] One of my bee friends[N]
gave it to me...[A] You seem like a[N]
bee enjoyer, too.[A][X]

##I1EstelleTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][CloseEyes]
...Alas, mine life is but a...[N]
But a... No, that won't...[A][N][OpenEyes]
Oh, hello there. Didn't see you.[A][N]
My name's Estelle, though if you've been[N]
to the playhouse,[A] you may know me by[N]
a different name.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Theatre? We don't have many[N]
theatres in my homeland.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose our political revolution sparked[N]
somewhat of an artistic rebirth as well.[A][N]
Anyway, if you'll be in the city a while,[N]
come by and see our production-[A][N]
it's a modern classic called [OpenQuote]Dawn's Maiden[N]
and the Champion of Radiance.[CloseQuote][A][N]
My role is that of a humble young noblelady,[N]
who wishes for a life of freedom...[A][N]
She eventually ends up in the company[N]
of a mercenary troupe, and, well...[A][N]
Look, I don't want to ruin the show for you![A][N]
Anyway, I've been feeling... off, with my role.[N]
Normally, I just [OpenQuote]become[CloseQuote] another person...[A][N]
That's what acting is, ain't it?[A][N]
But for some reason, I feel like I'm[N]
missing a connection...[A][N]
Maybe what I need is to join a mercenary[N]
troupe myself...[A][N]
Rift over there's been talking about finding[N]
work... I can probably trust him. I think.[A][N]
Anyway, sorry for rambling there.[N]
And welcome to Mevion.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Greetings, young woman! Might I interest[N]
you in a relic beyond compare?[A][N]
For a mere 1500 gold, I'll give you[N]
a truly incredible staff![A][N]
What do you say?[A][X]

##I1NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Wait... You don't have enough money![N]
What a shame.[A] Come back if you[N]
scrounge up enough cash.[A][X]

under ZERO circumstances, take refunds.[A][X]

##I1StaffDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4][OpenMidLeft]
...No thank you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]What a shame. If you change your[N]
mind, I'll be right here.[A][X]

##I1NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
Hm... I still have a few things[N]
I'd like to do here.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Understandable. Take your time.[A][X]

##I1ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]

Let us proceed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Very well. Prepare to advance.[A][X]
