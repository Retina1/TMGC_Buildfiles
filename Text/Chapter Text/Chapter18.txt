[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Thank you, my friend.[A][N]
And thank you, Opistus, for[N]
leading me to these youths.[A][N]
I shall do what it takes[N]
to keep them all safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Archbishop! Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that you?[N]
What're you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He has brought me to you.[N]
I shall serve your will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sure this is alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fear not, child. If the worst[N]
is to come,[A] there are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
contingencies in place.[A][N]
For now, let me aid you[N]
to the best of my ability.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you're certain[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Thank you, Archbishop.[A][X]

##Ch18_AllAlight
[OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
Damn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] They're too strong[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And it's too bright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There goes our advantage.[A][N]
Fellas[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's shameful to admit,[N]
but we gotta run.[A][N]
We'll live to burn another day.[A][X]

##Ch18_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadVladmir]
hi[A][X]

##Ch18_EndingVladmirDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
we have so much blood on our hands[A][X]

##Ch18_EndingNoVladmir
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke]
That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] tense.[N]
But I think we drove them off.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadVladmir]
I see you've kept yourselves well.[A][N][OpenRight]
Wha-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A-archbishop? Is that you?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
That it is, child. I apologize[N]
for my tardiness.[A][N]
He has informed me of your trials,[N]
and I felt compelled to come help.[A][N][OpenRight]
I appreciate that, Archbishop[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But what if[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
If something happens to me, Opistia[N]
has contingencies in place.[A][N]
I shall do what you require[N]
of me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Archbishop. Anyway[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Shall we continue, Zeke?[A][N][OpenRight]
Certainly. Though, given the harsh[N]
battles we've seen,[A] we may want to[N]
take some time to rest.[A][N]
If this map's accurate, there's[N]
a nice clearing ahead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'll make camp for a few days.[N]
And then, it's off to the Aqueduct.[A][X]

##Ch18_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
If I'm reading this map correctly,[N]
we should be nearing northern Holanis.[A][N]
From there, we'll be a stone's[N]
throw from the Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I must say, it's getting[N]
rather dark and dreary.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say.[N]
I've been thinking.[A][N]
Lately, I mean.[A][N]
Am I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worthy?[Event][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worthy? Of what?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, all of this.[N]
Leading us into war.[A][N]
Having a crown on my head.[N]
Everything I've recently gained.[A][N]
When all I've done my whole life is[N]
while away at the edge of the world.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Am I to believe that I'm the future[N]
of Elba Cor,[A] just because I was[N]
lucky enough to be born that future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't think I can give[N]
you a satisfying answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
It's alright. I know it's a lot.[N]
I just can't shake it from my mind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
In any case, you've been invaluable.[A][N]
Ever since you joined our forces,[N]
it's like a weight has been lifted.[A][N][CloseEyes]
The war with Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It constantly felt[N]
like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was drowning.[A][N]
Like the world was closing in on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Good people fell on my watch.[A][N]
And I felt I had to burden myself[N]
with it all. For the army's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Apologies for pouring that out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. It does us well[N]
to speak our minds.[A][N][Event][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBaddie1]
How touchin'. It'll also do ye[N]
well ta die, ye' rats![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
Fellas! It's them nobles who took[N]
down the Brothers Ed![A][N]
Well, I'll have ye know,[N]
we've got a policy here:[A][N]
No baddies go unavenged.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Get 'em, boys![N]
Drown these dastards in darkness![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke]
Darkness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If that's their game,[N]
I think I've a plan.[A][N]
I see one torch nearby, and I have[N]
to imagine there's more.[A][N]
Set them ablaze, and their ambush[N]
loses its teeth.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Good thinking, Zeke.[A] Everyone! It's[N]
time to bring light to the darkness![A][X]

##_Ch18SysText
To complete this map,[N]
light every torch.[A][N]
They must all bit lit at once-[N]
don't bother dousing them.[A][N]
Once they're all lit, the map will end[N]
at the start of the next enemy phase.[A][X]

##C18BungalasBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
Gwahaha! The Great Bungalas[N]
will smash you![A][X]

##C18BungalasDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
Gwah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
