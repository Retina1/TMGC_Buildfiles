[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Out-of-Mind Gladius,[CloseQuote] Aercolyn's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[...]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]I have. I've been here many times.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wait[...] Lady Blair!? It's been[N]
so[...] very long.[A][N]
I'm glad to see you well.[A][N]
I know you've got something real[N]
big comin',[A] so I'll put in[N]
your usual. It's on the house.[A][N]
[...]Thanks for coming back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose I have some time.[N]
[...]Thank you.[A][X]

##I10Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]We're here. I'm sure you've[N]
much to do, so I won't keep you.[A][N]
Just come find me when you're ready[N]
to plan our defense.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] appreciate it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove](...It's been so very long.[N]
But I'm finally here.)[A][N]
(This might be our last chance[N]
to safely stock up on supplies.)[A][N]
(And I certainly should check in[N]
on everybody, if I can.)[A][N]
(...If this place is untouched,[N]
the vault might...)[A][N]
(It might be worth a check.[N]
...No more hesitation.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[...]Onwards.[A][X]

##I10DoorText
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove](...As expected, this hasn't[N]
been opened in years.)[A][N]
(I... was told years ago to[N]
unseal this to change my fate.)[A][N][CloseEyes]
(...It never made sense, but[N]
there's... no harm trying.)[A][N]
(...And open.)[A][X]

##I10ChestText
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove](...A sword? Since when did my[N]
father use swords?)[A][N]
(...There's a pair of notes[N]
attached to it. Let's see...)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenQuote][...]For my lovely lady. Let our[N]
strengths be as one.[A][N]
Mine wits and skill have crafted[N]
a sword worthy of you.[A][N]
I name it Hopesinger. Let it[N]
protect that which you hold dear.[A][N]
Your homeland. Your husband.[N]
Your newborn daughter.[A][N]
[...]I shall be off to Holanis.[N]
But I will come back to you.[CloseQuote][A][N]
[...]So this was a gift for Mother.[A][N]
[...]And this is the other note.[A][N]
[OpenQuote][...]She left. She left me.[A][N]
Let that be your lesson, child.[N]
You're the only one you can trust.[A][N]
[...]If I am gone when you find this,[N]
then I am vindicated.[A][N]
Do as you wish with this blade.[N]
It is worthless to me now.[CloseQuote][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]You're wrong. My bonds got me[N]
to where I am now.[A][N]
[...]I hardly knew you, but I know[N]
I won't repeat your mistakes.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]This sword will lead Dalst[N]
out of the shadows. I swear it.[A][X]
