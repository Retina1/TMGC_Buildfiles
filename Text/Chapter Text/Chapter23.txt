##C23TarquinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
You wish to destabilize the[N]
law of this land.[A][N]
Wash away order with chaos.[N]
For that, I cannot look away.[A][N]
You will get what comes to all[N]
who stand defiant before me.[A][X]

##C23TarquinBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You do not wish to back down.[N]
Unfortunate, young lady.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I can't back down. Not now,[N]
after learning what I know.[A][N]
Surely, you wouldn't stand[N]
for it either.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
I never pretended to[N]
understand Arbordia.[A][N]
I've always understood[N]
conflict and control,[A] and that[N]
has served me enough this far.[A][N]
Maybe it's shortsighted,[A][N]
but I'm not throwing away[N]
these years.[A][N]
Arbordia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, Girard. He's[N]
earned my trust.[A][N]
My respect. All you've done is[N]
scamper around the continent.[A][N]
If his will is for you to[N]
fall, I won't deny it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C23TarquinKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Kenneth. Do you really think[N]
your forces can take us on?[A][N]
I taught you better than that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I wouldn't know. I'm not our[N]
tactician.[A] I'm not what you[N]
wanted out of me, I guess.[A][N]
Now. Let us pass. I'd rather[N]
not cut you down.[A][N]
But I will if I must.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Show me what you've learned.[A][N]
Show me how you wear the[N]
name of Neillstrom.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I'll do you one better.[A][N]
I'll show you my own will.[N]
One that stands on its own.[A][N]
I don't need a title to hide[N]
behind. I never have.[A][X]

##C23TarquinNatasiaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
You must be Natasia.[N]
Kenneth has spoken of you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
So he has.[A][N]
He's also spoken of you.[N]
Not many great things.[A][N]
Plus, you've threatened[N]
Blair.[A] So, pal[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not lookin' good for you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
You think you can stand up[N]
to one such as I?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well, commoner.[N]
You won't be missed.[A][X]

##C23TarquinDesmondBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
I've always appreciated your[N]
skill, Desmond.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
As have I.[A][N]
Unfortunate that we must fight,[N]
but I won't hold back.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Neither will I.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C23TarquinZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Young prince. You're making[N]
a grave mistake.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Hardly. I've seen the sins[N]
of your nation.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know what we must do[N]
for the rest of the world.[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Sins of my land?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elba Cor spent a decade[N]
wasting away.[A][N]
Mevion's a closed off hive[N]
of villainy and scum.[A][N]
Yg'stra's a lawless purgatory.[N]
Need I go on?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
The whole world's a flawed place.[N]
That doesn't erase your flaws.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And we'll lead the world[N]
to a new era.[A][X]

##C23TarquinHyperiusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
General of Elba Cor.[N]
Your strength is great.[A][N]
And yet, you cannot triumph[N]
against Dalst's might.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Don't count us out yet,[N]
Tarquin.[A][N]
My country's survived far[N]
worse than you.[A][N]
Far worse than what Dalst[N]
can ever throw at us.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. Have at me.[N]
I shall break your resolve.[A][X]

##C23TarquinDalstianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
It's not too late for[N]
you to surrender.[A][N]
Return. Swear yourself[N]
to Dalst anew.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N]
You shall be cleansed.[A][X]

##C23TarquinYgstranBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Turning your blade on[N]
he who conquered?[A][N]
A bold move. Well, Yg'stran[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'll grant you the[N]
death you deserve.[A][X]

##C23TarquinSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I remember seeing one[N]
of your kind.[A][N]
Girard thought you a[N]
potential guardian.[A][N]
An overseer of order.[A][N]
But it was not meant[N]
to be.[A][X]

##Ch23_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure you don't wish[N]
for the army to escort you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is alright. It's my duty alone[N]
to confront those in Holanis.[A][N]
Those with ties to Sinclair.[A][N]
Their power is unfathomable, and[N]
I'd rather not risk your life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And for the sake of Dalst, you[N]
probably shouldn't risk yours.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If worst comes to[N]
worst,[A] Ciraweiss is next[N]
in line to control Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lord Ciraweiss? Isn't he[N]
quite along in years?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More than likely at this point,[N]
Ethyl would run things.[A][N]
She's already essentially taken[N]
control of her own state's affairs.[A][N]
In any case, I hardly plan on dying.[N]
Have at least some faith, Tarquin.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, sir. Safe travels.[A][X]

##C23_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Phew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] These're exhausting to[N]
navigate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. It's not unlike what[N]
I've seen in Mevion.[A][N]
If I'm not mistaken, I think[N]
I see some solid land over there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. There's not[N]
just land.[A][N]
Up there in the sky.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A wyvern?[A][X]

##C23_Opening2
[OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good day, young lady.[A][N][OpenRight]
L-Lord Neillstrom? What are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What are you doing out here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Lord Arbordia instructed me to lead[N]
the Yg'stran remnants here.[A][N]
Some manner of loyalty-building[N]
exercise, I suppose.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unusual. In any case,[N]
we've dire findings.[A][N]
Dalst's entwined in conspiracy[N]
within the Holanian wilds.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. What do you[N]
intend to do?[A][N][OpenRight]
Bring it to light, of course.[A][N]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are you implying?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So he was right.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The sentencing shall begin.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sentencing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Girard feared that you'd turn[N]
traitor to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Surrender yourself now,[N]
and I will make this quick.[A][N][OpenRight]
Absolutely not![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. I suppose this can[N]
be that Yg'stran exercise.[A][N]
Know that in forfeiting a swift[N]
and noble execution,[A][N]
you've damned yourself and your friends to[N]
a miserable end to these lawless savages.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But perhaps this will be what they[N]
need to be brought to order.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And if you fell them, you'll[N]
still fall before me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In the distance. They're coming.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So this is what Dalst[N]
has come to.[A][N]
It's decided, then.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Lord Neillstrom must fall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to agree.[N]
Shocking as it is.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] will that be enough?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'd hope[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But if it's the Yg'strans[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They're sure to be organized.[A][N]
We'll just have to find anyone who[N]
looks important,[A] and dismantle[N]
their chain of command.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Very well. Once we do this,[N]
there's truly no turning back.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
We have to do this for[N]
the future of Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not just Dalst.[N]
For[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all of Ulmaron.[A][X]
