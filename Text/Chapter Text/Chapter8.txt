...Are you quite sure offering to[N]
do this was the best idea?[A][N][OpenRight]
His Majesty surely would gladly[N]
assist you without... this.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, maybe I am in over my head.[A][N]
But if the king is offering to help[N]
us, I can't just give nothing in return![A][N]
Besides, this isn't too severe a detour.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
...I'm sure the old man appreciates it.[N]
And this'll be a chance to see Cid in action.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Gwah hah hah! Righty-o, lad![A][N]
You be almost as mad as me for[N]
doin' this, lass![A] I like[N]
yer attitude.[A][N][OpenLeft]
See? We'll be fine.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
If you say so. I believe we're nearing[N]
the sacred grounds.[A] It's quite dark,[N]
so be careful out there.[A][N]
If we want to do this right,[N]
we'll need to rout them all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll do me best to leave 'em kickin'.[N]
Gotta let the youngsters have some.[A][N]
But if things get rough, don't be[N]
afraid to let me go wild.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'm sure you'll get to unleash[N]
the fury, sir![A][X]

...Are you quite sure offering to[N]
do this was the best idea?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The king was ready and willin'[N]
to help you for free, after all.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, maybe I am in over my head.[A][N]
But if the king is offering to help[N]
us, I can't just give nothing in return![A][N]
Besides, this isn't too severe a detour.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Very well. I suppose there's no stopping[N]
you once you're set on something.[A][N]
In any case, this will be a chance[N]
to evaluate our new ally's skill.[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]

This'll be but a brief diversion.[A][N]
Besides, after what happened to[N]
the king's knights...[A][N]
...We owe this to the kingdom.[A][N][OpenRight]
...Very well, Blair.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
That's all of them, lass.[A][N]]OpenMidLeft]
Excellently done, everyone.[N]
I'm sure the king will be pleased.[A][N][OpenRight]
I still don't quite see what[N]
this accomplished,[A][N]
but I suppose that's neither[N]
here nor there.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, sometimes ya' don't need to[N]
think about those things.[A][N]

##C8EsmeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Why are you doing this?[N]
We're just trying to live.[A][N]
You're the ones who cast us[N]
out into the proverbial fire![A][X]

##C8EsmeRachaelBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
Wait... I recognize you.[N]
You're Esme, correct?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Ah, one of the king's dogs?[A][N]
What, have you come to drive[N]
us out of [OpenQuote]sacred grounds[CloseQuote]?[A][N]
Don't give me that. You know[N]
we've been cast out.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][CloseEyes]
...It is the duty of a knight[N]
to serve their liege.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
...There's truly nothing left[N]
for you. Goodbye.[A][X]

##C8EsmeCassiusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Those colors... So, the king[N]
did send you after all.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
So what if he did?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Your kind and your blind[N]
obedience sicken me.[A][N]
We're a people suffering[N]
here, and we get no sympathy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius][CloseEyes]
...I can't fix the world order.[N]
All I can do is my duty.[A][X]
