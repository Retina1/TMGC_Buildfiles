[...]What did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll keep this brief. You are[N]
a man of unlimited potential.[A][N]
And yet, you have made a mistake[N]
most untenable.[A] Still, I believe[N]
there is room for compromise.[A][N]
For you to grow from this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've written for you a modest proposal.[A][N]
If you take the deal and render us your[N]
assistance, you will be a free man.[A][N]
And it would simply be a shame for[N]
one like you to remain shackled.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Give me-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Some time to think on the matter?[N]
But of course.[A] The plan is one[N]
of a grand scale anyways.[A][N]
Just know that if you join us,[N]
you will be remembered.[A][N]
[...]As it stands, you are to be[N]
forgotten by history.[A][N]
A true pity of a fate.[A][N]
Now. Feel free to take your leave.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][Event][OpenMidRight]
[...]This criminal may be nothing.[N]
Or he may be everything.[A][N]
But with our future at stake,[N]
every card must be played.[A][N]
[...]And on that note, I believe[N]
it's time for him to pay his dues.[A][N]
Surely, he will understand that he[N]
brought everything unto himself.[A][X]

##Prologue_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]So is this the place?[N]
Neillstrom territory?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Should be. [...]Don't see any signs[N]
of what the council reported.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I can't go back empty-handed.[N]
I need to impress them somehow.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I'm sure you did when you took their[N]
suggestion of doing this alone seriously.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How was I supposed to know that[N]
was a joke?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
And that there is the problem with[N]
the council.[A] You'd think they'd[N]
spare at least a handful of troops.[A][N]
But I digress.[A] [...]Hold. I think I[N]
see something ahead.[A][N]
[...]Looks like some rebels.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see as well. Should we[...][N]
try talking to them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Look at them, Blair. They're[N]
not going to listen to you.[A][N]
And I'm sure the council would[N]
prefer they be eliminated anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah. Right. [...]Well. Should[...][N]
we get started?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Are you sure you're alright[N]
with all of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of[...] Of course![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Get in there with[N]
your magic when you can.[A][N]
I've[...] known swordplay for some[N]
time, and I've also a staff.[A][N]
As long as we're decently careful,[N]
we should be fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
We can handle this.[A][N]
I know we can![A][X]

##Prologue_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that it? Have we won?[A][N][OpenRight]
I believe[...] we have.[A][N]
The people living here[N]
need fear no longer.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What happened, anyway?[A][N]
To think you'd be dealing[N]
with our rabble.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Orders from the council.[N]
For Aercolyn's re-legitimization.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]They choose to send a young girl,[A][N]
one with zero combat experience,[N]
to quash a rebellion.[A][N]
[...]Sometimes I truly wonder how[N]
Dalst's not collapsed yet.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sounds like you were concerned for us.[N]
How sweet of you, Kenneth![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Anyway.[A] It appears I can't[N]
escape being involved in this.[A][N]
If you two are to continue on this[N]
journey, I shall follow you.[A][N]
Clearly, without my levelheadedness,[N]
you'll be digging early graves.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then![A][N]
I guess you can call that payback for[N]
all the times I bailed you out,[A][N]
back at the academy.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I had hoped we came to a mutual[N]
agreement never to speak of that again.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Enough, you two. We ought to[N]
report this day's events.[A][N]
Let us depart.[A][X]

##Prologue_Ending_Dead_Kenneth

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Is that it? Have[...] we won?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I believe[...] we have.[A][N]
The people living here[N]
need fear[...] no longer.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sorry[...] Kenneth[...][N]
This is[...] my fault[...][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Blair[...] It is[...] regrettable[N]
what happened today.[A][N]
But you must not blame[N]
yourself.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But that[...] that's just not true![A][N]
I'm the one who chose[...][N]
who chose to fight![A][N]
I dragged him into this[...][N]
And now he's dead![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Let us proceed.[N]
It's our duty to carry on for him.[A][N]

Wait[...] is that Blair?[A][N]
What's she doing in Neillstrom[N]
lands after so long?[A][N]
I[...] I had seen reports on the[N]
recent uprisings[...][A] But to think[N]
SHE'd be acting on them?[A][N]
[...]Whatever the case, it's my[N]
duty to help an old friend.[A][N]
I'll give these brutes a taste[N]
of what I can conjure.[A][X]

##PNVillageText

have already evacuated.[A][N]
[...]What's this note?[A][N]
[OpenQuote]If any heroes see this, please,[N]
take this relic and save our town![CloseQuote][A][N]
[...]It'd be wrong NOT to[N]
take this, right?[A][X]

##PSVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Are you with Dalst? [...]Yes?[N]
Oh, thank the heavens![A][N]
These rebels have been performing[N]
vile acts to draw your attention.[A][N]
At this point, I don't even care[N]
what their cause is anymore.[A][N]
I just want to know that I'll[N]
live to see tomorrow.[A][N]
Please, take this, and use it[N]
to save our village![A][X]

##PDavelarnBattle

I say![A][X]

##PDavelarnDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavelarn]
Urgh! You[...] scum[...][A][N]
Signing us[...] away[...][N]
to[...] Yg'stra[...][A][N]

the end[...] for you[...][A][N]

##PBlairBattle

I mustn't falter now[...][A][N]

The primal magical essence[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
Shall deliver us to[N]
a glorious future![A][X]

##PBlairKennethTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I'm glad to see you, Kenneth.[N]
What brings you by, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was[...] merely headed north to conduct[N]
some business for my father.[A][N]
But I should ask you that.[A][OpenMidRight]
Orders from Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]To stomp out these[N]
rebels singlehandedly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Arin's here too.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Alright. Clearly some miscommunication's[N]
been happening.[A] But don't worry.[N]
I'll lend a hand.[A] It's my territory,[N]
so it's my problem too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate it, Kenneth.[N]
[...]Good to see you again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't thank me yet. I'll show[N]
you what I've learned.[A][X]
