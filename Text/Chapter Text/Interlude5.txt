[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello there. Who might you be?[N]
You appear to have business with Father.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]? But, wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Wouldn't that mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, of course. I should introduce myself.[N]
Prince Ezekiel. Or just Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So that means[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You've been alive[N]
this entire time?[A] I just realized.[N]
Haven't introduced myself either.[A][N]
I'm Blair. From[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How did I not put[N]

Do you ever regret them? Ever hate how[N]
in this life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] there's only one chance?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And yet, part of me would make[N]
all those choices again.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Sorry for rambling. I've long lost[N]

Even an old man as I is[N]
impressed by your deeds.[A][N]
I myself have been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite busy.[A][N]
I regret not helping against Yg'stra,[N]
but my mission was worth it.[A][N]

##I5Opening
[OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenLeft][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're finally back. It's still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
hard to believe.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Young lady! It's a pleasure to see you well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Same to you, Archbishop.[N]
If you're here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's correct. Elba Cor is still[N]
standing.[A] They probably would've[N]
managed without our help,[A][N]
but we relieved a lot of pressure.[A][N]
Since you're back, I presume[N]
your task went to plan?[A][N][OpenLeft]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is correct. Yg'stra has fallen.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Unfortunately, the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is no more.[N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what happens now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I planned ahead and arranged a roundtable.[A][N]
Elba Cor, Opistia, and Dalst shall all[N]
be in attendance.[A] We will discuss the[N]
fate of Yg'stra there.[A][N]
In fact, I believe every necessary party[N]
is in the city.[A] Once you've arrived[N]
at the castle, we'll convene.[A][N]
Don't feel rushed, though. I'm sure that[N]
it has been a long and painful journey.[A][N]
Take some time to yourself. There's lots[N]
to see here.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
On that note, it seems there's commotion[N]
near the castle,[A] beyond what this meeting[N]
should be capable of causing.[A][N]
What of that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, of course. Today is a blessed day indeed.[N]
You recall hearing of Prince Zeke, correct?[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
The late prince? What of him?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I'm sure you'll see for youself.[N]
I must be off now.[A][N]
May you all ever walk in His light.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
Well, you heard him. We're in no rush.[N]
This would be a good time to resupply.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But the war's over.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
You can never be too prepared.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well, Arin. Once we're done,[N]
I'll make my way to the king.[A][N]
Then we can get these talks in motion.[A][X]

##I5Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadBrandl][OpenRight][LoadElcorian][OpenFarRight][LoadNeillstrom][OpenFarLeft]
Greetings, General Neillstrom.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's an honor to see you, your majesty.[N]
Apologies for Lord Arbordia's absence.[A][N]
I trust my presence here to be[N]
satisfactory?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. You're Dalst's most reputable[N]
man when it comes to military.[A][N]
If I may ask, who is that with you?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah, right. I am Elcorian. One of[N]
Arbordia's peers.[A][N]
Call me an envoy, I suppose.[A][N]
I felt my presence here would be valuable,[N]
especially given my familiarity with Blair.[A][N]
On that note, it's good to see you well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Thank you, Elcorian. That means a lot.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadVladmir]
And of course, I shall speak[N]
for Opistia in these talks.[A][N]
Though, my people wish to pull out[N]
of Yg'stra as soon as possible.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I would agree. The last thing Elba Cor[N]
needs is more territory to worry about.[A][N]
Especially when we don't even quite[N]
know why this war began.[A][N][OpenLeft]
If[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If I may. Before the emperor perished[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He'd mentioned something.[A][N]
Some kind of dark force from[N]
within the shadows.[A][N]
Pulling the strings of this war.[N]
Forcing him to invade to save his people.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadNeillstrom]
Interesting. Perhaps his words held weight.[A][N]
Or perhaps they were the ramblings of[N]
a madman.[A] Either way, Yg'stra needs[N]
some kind of order, now.[A][N]
Luckily, Arbordia prepared a contingency[N]
plan for this event.[A][N]
If there are no objections, the Dalstian[N]
army shall occupy Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]One moment, please.[A][N]
If I'm not mistaken[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] By Yg'stran law,[N]
the strongest is the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And if Blair overcame the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Are you saying I'm technically the[N]
emperor of Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps if their society recognizes you[N]
as such[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's absurd, Elcorian.[N]
Do you truly believe-[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm just saying, that could lend[N]
an air of legitimacy to this.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Unfortunately, that would likely conflict[N]
with Arbordia's intentions.[A][N]
Do recall Aercolyn's position[N]
within Dalst.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course, said position may change[N]
given recent events,[A] but until then,[N]
we ought to act in Dalst's best interest.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I understand. Yg'stra is yours to take.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Excellent. I believe a night's recess is in[N]
order before we finalize any details.[A][N]
If it pleases you, your majesty, talks[N]
shall resume again tomorrow.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. Keep well, everyone.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies, Blair.[A][N][OpenLeft]
What for?[A][N][OpenRight]
Tarq- General Neillstrom walked all[N]
over you there.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, it's as he said. Things[N]
might change.[A][N][OpenRight]
I get that. It's just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I feel bad.[A][N]
Amidst proving your loyalty, you're[N]
thrust into a grueling campaign.[A][N]
And all I did to help was give[N]
you a pittance of gold.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Nobody could've seen what this[N]
war were to become.[A][N]
And in any case, it's over now.[A][N][OpenRight]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it is.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
One more thing. I have something for you.[N]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, look for yourself.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] beautiful. And this emblem[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Is it the Aercolyn insignia?[A][N][OpenRight]
That'd be correct. This medallion had[N]
been confiscated from your father.[A][N]
Ever since his exile, it'd just been[N]
collecting dust in Arbordia.[A][N]
Given your stature, I felt it[N]
right to return to you.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps keep this quiet.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course, Elcorian. Thank you for this.[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
It's nothing. I shall see you[N]
when we reconvene.[A][X]

##I5KennethScene
[OpenLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
There you are, Kenneth. Don't go and[N]
think you can hide from your dad![A][N]
And, Blair[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Apologies for back there.[A][N]
You understand. Arbordia's always playing[N]
several steps ahead.[A] Taking the[N]
initiative. All of that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How much did my father[N]
pry from you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Now, son. Pry's a strong word![A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Again, I'm just acting[N]
in Arbordia's interests.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hmph. Why did he not show up himself?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Beats me. I'll never quite understand[N]
that man's schedule.[A][N]
Anyway, it's good to see you're both well.[N]
Has my boy been any help, Blair?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Either way you take this, it'll just[N]
make a fool of me, somehow.[A][N]
I've been sufficient, father.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good to hear. Keep yourself safe, alright?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry about that.[N]
He's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a lot.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Trust me, I've known for a while.[N]
But as he's said, it's Arbordia's game.[A][N]
Nothing to fault your father for.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I suppose. Still, you'd hope the man would[N]
have a semblance of independent thought.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
But, hey. That's what I'm for.[N]
I'll carve my own path.[A][X]
