[OpenMidLeft]
So we're to stop Mevionese[N]
interloping?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I believe that's the case.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Why us, though?[N]
Surely they've better options.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine it's a test of sorts.[N]
Seeing if you can handle this.[A][N]
I'd imagine that Dalst wouldn't just[N]
hand your family title back,[A][N]
after what your father did.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Surely there's more reasonable[N]
tests of trust than this?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately, this is how it is.[N]
At least you're not alone.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Very true! ...I might've forgotten to say[N]
this, but thanks for sticking with me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I mean, we've known each other for[N]
years. There's no chance I'd leave you alone.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm glad to hear that.[N]
Come- let's prepare to advance![A][N][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
We're in the base, Blair.[N]
You should know this place.[A][N]
It's where we can just sit back[N]
and talk before the battle.[A][N]
I suggest talking to everyone[N]
you can-[A] good things will[N]
surely happen.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see! Hey, do I get[N]
anything for this one?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Uh... Take... this...?[N]
I... found it on the ground.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wow, what a lucky find![A][X]
