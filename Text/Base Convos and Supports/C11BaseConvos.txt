...*Sigh*...[A][N]
You know, I'd thought I had[N]
something going.[A][N]
That I was this defender of the[N]
weak I proclaimed myself to be.[A][N]
But at every turn... Well, life's[N]
trying to prove me wrong![A][N]
Twice now, Yg'stra's had us[N]
backed up into a corner,[A][N]
and twice now, I've failed this[N]
army in its darkest moments![A][N]
You'd think I'd have learned[N]
a thing or two...[A] But no![A][N]
People have died because of[N]
my failure to protect them![A][N]
Maybe it's time I pack[N]
up and retire...[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
...Huh? What's this?[A][N][MoveRight]
Whoa! This lance is... immaculate![N]
The most beautiful I've ever seen.[A][N]
...Oh. And there's the bones of[N]
the man who died wielding it.[A][N]
Still... For the lance itself to be so[N]
pristine... That must mean something.[A][N]
...I feel it calling me. Telling me[N]
that my duty is not yet done.[A][N][CloseEyes]
...Perhaps you're right, lance.[N]
Maybe it isn't too late to save someone.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I'm just gonna...[A][N][MoveRight]
take you real quick...[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
There we go. You're truly a[N]
thing of beauty.[A] Thanks for[N]
reminding me of my path.[A][X]

It appears we have no choice[N]
but to fight in the sands.[A][N]
Far from an ideal situation,[N]
especially for our cavalry,[A][N]
but our enemies will obviously[N]
have to contend with it too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Really? I'd hardly noticed[N]
the sand as an issue.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, right. I've read about this before.[N]
Magic users aren't affected by the sand.[A][N]
...How DOES that work, anyway?[A][N]
I guess since we're in the holy land,[N]
acolytes may have some sort of favor?[A][N]
And I suppose anima mages might have[N]
some say over the earth?[A] But then[N]
what about elder scholars?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's better not to think about it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. On an unrelated note,[N]
I see some strange markings in the sand.[A][N]
Perhaps we should investigate them,[N]
assuming we have the time.[A][N]
It's possible they're hiding[N]
something quite valuable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you suggesting buried treasure?[N]
...Cid's crew would've enjoyed that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. No point in dwelling on it.[A][X]
