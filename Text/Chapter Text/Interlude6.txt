Hey, Sveltzalus. How're you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveMidRight][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, can't imagine all this ash[N]
and soot is good for you.[A][N]
Sorry about that, friend.[A][N]
I must say, you've been in[N]
great form lately.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's that? Is your eye[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

You know, I gotta say.[N]
You're quite the machine.[A][N]
Still not quite sure if I[N]
got my money's worth[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ToggleSmile]
But you're fun. And sometimes,[N]
that's all that matters.[A][N]
I'm sure your creator's doing[N]
great things[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] And you'll be[N]

##I6ArtemisConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
Greetings, young lady. I had been[N]
meaning to ask you something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You knew I was from Holanis, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] correct. I guess we could've[N]
saved some trouble by asking you things.[A][N]
Lime where the army we fought  came from.[A][N]
Apologies. It's been a hectic string of[N]
events, and I overlooked that option.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can appreciate being busy. Besides,[N]
as it happens, I wouldn't be much help.[A][N]
The closest thing to an army Holanis[N]
should have is in Gohranos,[A] and it's[N]
hardly enough to support an invasion.[A][N]
Many of those at the archives were[N]
mercenary in nature.[A] Technically, you[N]
could argue all Gohranians are mercenary,[A][N]
but in this case, most of those at the[N]
archives were not familiar to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What does that mean? Is someone[N]
funding these mercenaries?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If only I knew. Gohranos should hardly[N]
have the coin for this kind of manpower.[A][N]
Perhaps there's another faction behind[N]
the scenes, setting this all up.[A][N]
But I've seen nothing of that in[N]
Gohranos.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can probably just continue[N]
our route as planned.[A][N]
The landmarks that're recorded[N]
in the Archives.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd agree. Of the three, I've only ever been to[N]
the Aqueduct, and only in passing.[A][N]
Can't say anything for sure of[N]
what actually happens there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, Artemis.[N]
This helped a lot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time. I'd rather not fight for[N]
a Holanis borne of the shadows.[A][X]

##I6ToddsworthConvo

Ah, milady. Perfect timing![N]
I had the grandest of ideas![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it, Toddsworth?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To bolster army morale, I thought[N]
perhaps I could regale us with a song.[A][N]
A perfect ballad came to me in a vision![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What kind of vision?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, I found some absolutely[N]
delectable berries,[A] and when I[N]
ate them,[A] the gods themselves came[N]
unto me.[A] They called me their most[N]
turpid vessel,[A] and spoke to me a[N]
song beyond mortal ken.[A][N]
And then, I woke up and found a stream[N]
of blood coming from my ears.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're fine now.[A][N]
Anyway, shall I?[A][X]

Lady Blair! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm alright, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! A quick question,[N]
if you'll be so kind.[A][N]
I've been meaning to get[N]
in some sparring.[A][N]
Specifically, some practice[N]
against other swordsmen.[A][N]
I'm wondering if there's anyone[N]
in particular you wish me spar.[A][N]
I'd imagine I'll grow differently[N]
based on my opponent, after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd trust your judgement,[N]

I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]

make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]

It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
