How're you holding up, Sam?[N]
Things are definitely tense.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] strange. Normally, I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm glad to hear that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know that one wrong move[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

me together.[A] Knowing that I[N]

Fine enough. A bit dark for my liking.[N]

I'm curious, Mikey. How does[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait, that's probably classified.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Probably. But you won the war,[N]
so who's to stop me, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I wasn't quite invested in many[N]
of the finer details,[A] but the[N]
basic structure's easy to grasp.[A][N]
At the head was Commander Valden.[A][N]
You'd think the emperor, the strongest[N]
warrior in the nation,[A] would be the[N]
one to lead the military,[A][N]
but governal duties muddle that.[A][N]
Underneath him would've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I think Lazarus?[A][N]
The upper echelons always confused me.[A][N]
What matters for the individual is[N]
that soldiers are sorted by specialty,[A][N]
often through which weapons they use[N]
or whether or not they're cavalry,[A][N]
and each of those regiments is lead[N]
by a paragon of that specialty.[A][N]
My[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My sister's actually the[N]
head of a unit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Impressive! Aercolyn's military is[N]
far smaller,[A] and thus far simpler.[N]

That's a horror I'd wish on nobody.[A][N][OpenEyes]
For real, though. I'm glad you're[N]
well. You keep things interesting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Agreed, Cassius.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Greetings, Sveltzalus.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still can't believe that name.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I mean, it's a fine name. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not what I figured Blair'd come up with.[A][N]
Anyway[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Keep up the good work?[N]
You've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite helpful?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I doing this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, then.[N]
Good day to you.[A][X]

Ah, Hilbert. How have you been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Check this out, Mister Emile![A][N][MoveMidRight]
Fwoosh![A][N]
Pretty impressive, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks! I've been practicing nonstop[N]
ever since we were in Yg'stra![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So that's what the bright flashes[N]
in the night were.[A][N]
I'm glad to see you're picking[N]
things up quickly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's all thanks to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly. The talent[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's all you.[A][N]
All I've done is show you some[N]
hand gestures and theory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but without you, I would've[N]
never known the magic moves![A][N]
You're a great teacher, Mister Emile![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate it, Hilbert.[A][X]

Another day, another battle.[A][N]
Better men than I would've[N]
given up on this by now.[A][N]
And that's to say nothing of[N]
you, Sam. I'm truly amazed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-thank you, sir. It's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
scary, for sure[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not sure if[N]
I made the right choice[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I've met brilliant people[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
like you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, Sam! I'm simply[N]
doing my duty.[A] Saving the world[N]
from the wretched,[A] while giving[N]
the old family some spare change.[A][N]
Speaking of, have you been in[N]
touch with your family at all?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]N-no. I doubt they[N]
even notice I'm gone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. Well, know that you're[N]
a true knight of Dalst.[A][N]
After this is over, we'd be[N]
happy to keep you with us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, sir.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]H-hello[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Sam, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that's correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, what did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] just wanted to[N]
ask about my technique.[A][N]
Y-you're a pretty fantastic[N]
sharpshooter, after all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm flattered, but you're quite[n]
skilled too.[A][N]
Don't sell yourself short.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. Even if you're lacking in sheer[N]
power, you make up in precision.[A][N]
I can't recall you missing any[N]
shots that've truly counted.[A][N]
I mean, we've not fought together[N]
long, but I doubt that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad you think highly of me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But you'll always be an unreachable[N]
goal for me to aspire to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks?[A][X]

Athena! Just who I wanted to see![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've got a wild proposition for you.[N]
Can I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hitch a ride?[A][N]
On your wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You see, though I hate to admit it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My armor leaves me a little[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] slow.[A][N]
I had hoped you could carry me to the[N]
frontlines, where I'd be effective.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. Hop on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yippee![A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
You seem excited.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To be frank, while there is of course[N]
strategic value to wyvern riding[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've also just always wanted to ride one.[N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thanks![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Actually, on second thought. Let's wait.[N]
Don't wanna overwhelm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What's the name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The name? Of the wyvern?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] personal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Well, perhaps after the battle,[N]
we can test their weight limit.[A][N]
I look forward to it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How was I supposed to know[N]
I needed to name you, friend?[A][X]

##KennethHilbertCPSupport

Mister Kenneth! I know your game![N]
You can't hide forever![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you still on that dark magic thing?[N]
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not just a thing, mister![A][N]
I've lost friends[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and even[N]
my family to dark magic![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, calamities brought upon[N]
by dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sorry to hear that. But I'd like[N]
you to understand something.[A][N]
I'm on your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hmph! You'll just have to prove that[N]
to me![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Back to the battle. I'll[N]
show you my brand of power.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why are you still here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't know. Why are[N]
YOU still here, woman?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a knight of Elba Cor.[N]
It's my duty to serve.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're wasting your life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do I even try with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, indeed? At least I know[N]
how messed up I am.[A][N]
You clearly think there's something[N]
worth saving in me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There isn't.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]

How have you been holding up,[N]
Bechamel?[A] Any luck with[N]
your learning?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, a bit. It be goin' slowly,[N]
but I think I got tha' basics.[A][N]
I'd show ya', but we be a bit[N]
busy fer that know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I'd be happy to see[N]
your progress after the battle.[A][N]
While you can obviously speak[N]
the modern tongue,[A][N]
learning to read written words is[N]
an entirely different experience.[A][N]
But you're a clever man. More so[N]

Ye flatter me, mate.[N]
Well, take care then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Sir Desmond, a moment.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No need for formality, Mikey.[N]
I'm hardly in charge of you.[A][N]
Desmond's fine.[A][N]
What do you require of me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Can you give me a few[N]
pointers on my technique?[A][N]
I need to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be better.[N]
So I can make it home.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Survival is an understandable[N]
goal for us all.[A] And proper technique,[N]
while it cannot ensure it,[A] will make[N]
it orders of magnitude more likely.[A][N]
That being said, I've noticed little[N]
that demands improvement.[A][N]
Your technique, as long as you keep[N]
up with drills, shall serve you well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad to hear.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must say, if survival is your goal,[N]
wouldn't it make sense to return home?[A][N]
Nothing binds you to us. Nobody would[N]
blame you for wanting a peaceful life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But I feel I owe Dalst[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's just the way I was raised, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough. In any case, you serve[N]
us well. We'll keep you safe.[A][X]
