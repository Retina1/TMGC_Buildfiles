##Ch12_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
I shall move to mobilize our army[N]
with all haste.[A][N]
Of course, all things take time.[A][N]
I've a suggestion if you wish[N]
to prepare for an invasion.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is that, sir?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've no doubt heard of and seen[N]
the Tower of Opistus by now.[A][N]
As something of a rite of passage,[N]
we hold a trial of strength within.[A][N]
Since you've the time and nothing[N]
else to do,[A] you might as well[N]
test your skills.[A][N]
It may be somewhat perilous,[N]
but what isn't, young one?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you think it's a good idea,[N]
I'll do it.[A][N]
Might as well make the most[N]
of our time here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent! In the meantime, I shall[N]
attend to business.[A][N]
Good luck, and may the light of[N]
Opistus shine on you.[A][X]

##Ch12_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
You must be Lady Blair. Greetings.[A][N]
I am Laronde, and I shall be[N]
overseeing your trial.[A][N]
Your goal is to reach and defeat me.[A][N]
Make use of any items in chests[N]
however you wish.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe that's everything.[N]
Take your positions when ready.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
This has me a little nervous,[N]
I must admit.[A][N]
What if we make fools of ourselves[N]
towards Opistia?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We've come this far. I doubt[N]
that'll happen.[A][N]
Remember. This may as well[N]
be a real battle.[A][N]
Nothing's different from[N]
the norm.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Right. You're right. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
do what we've done before.[A][X]

##Ch12_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
why did we do this[A][X]

##Ch12_Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
here have 10000 money[A][X]

##Ch12_Ending3
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenFarFarRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Girard. What did you[N]
wish to show me?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Ah, but of course. This is where we've[N]
been conducting[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] experiments.[A][N]
Though, given the progress we've made,[N]
I'm loathe to merely call them that.[A][N]
We've had successes in calling forth[N]
a power long forgotten by the world.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] truly something.[A][N]
I've never come close to a[N]
discovery of this magnitude.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
This place truly does open the[N]
mind, in a sense.[A][N]
We'll change the world for the[N]
better with what we find.[A][N]
Now come along. Simone's off elsewhere,[N]
but her research is coming along well.[A][N]
I'm quite certain you'll find it[N]
absolutely fascinating.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Of course. Lead the way.[A][X]

##_Ch12BossKill
Defeat Laronde[N]
and overcome trial.[X]

##Ch12_Flynn_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah! Hello! I hardly[N]
noticed you there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]Eep![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Wait, don't run away![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you going to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
say anything?[A][N]
You appear to be a swordsman[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Are you one of those brooding[N]
and silent types?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry, sorry![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not great at this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Talking to people,[N]
I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair enough. Might[N]
I at least have your name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Blair. Nice[N]
to meet you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. I should probably[N]
get back to the task at hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait, please. I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
like to join you.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You seem kind.[N]
I'd like to repay that kindness.[A][X]

##C12LarondeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
Impressive! But your real[N]
trial begins now.[A][N]
Good luck, and en garde![A][X]

##C12LarondeDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I yield.[N]
Well done.[A][N]
You are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] more than ready.[N]
Now, we'll just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Huh?[A][X]

##C12LarondeVsDragonDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is this power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[N]
I have to run[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's too much[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I must do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C12Huh
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
What is it? Isn't the trial over?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hear something. It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
coming down the stairs.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is it just me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Or does[N]
the air feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] cold?[A][N][X]

##C12OhNo
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Wha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What is that thing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I'm studied on my history[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
T-That's a dragon.[A] And not the[N]
tamed wyvern kind of dragon.[A][N]
That's a dragon that's lost to history.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's lost to history, how did[N]
it end up here, in front of us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I-I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know! This has[N]
never happened before![A][N]
It looks dangerous[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But we've[N]
got no choice.[A] We have to stop[N]
it from getting outside.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How will we even know if we're[N]
hurting it?[A] It looks[N]
absolutely impenetrable![A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's like our modern wyverns,[N]
it's not as durable as it looks.[A][N]
Worst case, one of the chests here might[N]
have some kind of dragon-killer.[A][N]
I'm certain that with its power,[A][N]
as well as your power that bested[N]
the trial, we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I hope you're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Everyone! We must bring[N]
an end to this threat![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It seems a bit[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] stunned by[N]
its surroundings.[A] Make use of this[N]
time before it collects itself![A][X]

##C12HeChargeth
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
The dragon's preparing to move![A][N]
If you can't handle it, fall back now![A][X]
