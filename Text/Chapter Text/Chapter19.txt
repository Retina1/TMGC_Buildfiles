Seize the carpet tile in the northwest[N]
to cause the river to flow.[A][N]
This will also open up the southern[N]
tower and allow you to seize to win.[A][N]
Note that if any units are left in the[N]
riverbed, they will be stuck.[A][N]
This applies to both player and enemy[N]
units.[A] Be careful if you don't want[N]
half of your army swimming.[A][N]
Also, note that both Blair and Zeke[N]
have the ability to seize points.[A][N]
This will hold true for all future[N]
maps with a seize objective.[A][X]
