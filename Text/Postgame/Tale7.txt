##Tale7Opening
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJoan][OpenLeft][LoadSonia][OpenRight][LoadTobias][OpenFarRight][LoadJonas]
Forces spotted, Sonia.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Excellent. [...]Well, not excellent.[N]
But excellently done.[A][N]
[...]You knew what I meant.[A][N]
[...]Can't believe those ingrates.[N]
The war's done.[A][N][OpenRight]
That's just 'ow it is, Sonia.[A][N]
Dalst 'ad it in for 'em, and they[N]
don't want Dalst's peace.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's much more than Dalst's peace.[N]
It's[...] It's Ulmaron's peace.[A][N][OpenLeft]
And yet we're the ones who have[N]
to beat it into them.[A][N]
[...]Guess it's practice for the[N]
tourney, if nothing else.[A][N][OpenRight]
That's the spirit, lassie.[A][N]
And don't go forgettin'. I've[N]
got me 'ole gang 'ere.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadDamien]
That's right! Point, and I'll[N]
give 'em the one-two![A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadZacharias]
Ready and willing.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadLeila]
[...]Sure.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
And don't forget, everyone.[A][N]
We're not killing our fellows[N]
today. Just subduing them.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadCarbon]
Ah. That's why our gear's[N]
so[...] plain.[A][N]
Thought someone might've been[N]
playin' me a bad joke.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadMikey]
It's a small comfort to know[N]
nobody needs to die today.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadSonia]
Just remember, they aren't sparing[N]
us that same mercy.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadJoan]
[...]Please do stay safe.[N]
Especially you, sweetie.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadJonas]
Pardon. I took the liberty of[N]
flying over their forces.[A][N]
Looks like they've got around[N]
seven elites calling the shots.[A][N]
Neutralize them, and we're in a[N]
good position to negotiate.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Thank you. Hear that, everyone?[A][N]
Seven troops, in and out.[N]
Quick and painless.[A][N]
[...]Move out![A][X]

##Tale7Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJoan][OpenLeft][LoadJonas][OpenRight][LoadSonia][OpenFarRight][LoadTobias][OpenFarLeft]
That should be all of them.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'll see to their wounded.[N]
Ensure no foul play.[A][N][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarRight]
Nicely done, lassies.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]What's nicely done about[N]
any of this?[A] We're barely[N]
holding these scraps together.[A][N]
Stuck with a land that we need[N]
to beat into submission.[A][N]
It's how it is, but it's so[...][N]
inefficient.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps Yg'stra's traditions are[N]
stuck in the past.[A][N]
[...]But I think we might be able[N]
to change them.[A][N]
You're the strongest women I know.[N]
[...]And the best all around.[A][N]
Anyway. If you can use that strength[N]
to win the tournament,[A] you're[N]
in a place to change the world.[A][N]
To show Yg'stra a path into the[N]
future you wish for it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yer wife's right, lass.[A][N]
You use yer strength to get[N]
'em to listen,[A] and then[N]
show 'em a different strength.[A][OpenRight]
[...]Is that a strength[N]
I really have, old man?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd say so. And even if you[N]
doubt yourself, we're here.[A][N]
No need to rebuild the world[N]
all on your own.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You'll do great, lass.[N]
Trust me.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]'as been a long day.[N]
I'm feelin' starved.[A][N]
Shall I prepare our forces[N]
a feast?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]You shall.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sounds delightful, Toby.[A][N]
[...]You did well today, love.[N]
You truly did.[A][N][OpenRight]
Then we can only hope to[N]
keep doing well.[A][N]
For Yg'stra.[A][X]
