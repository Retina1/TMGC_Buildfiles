[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Well, lassie... The winds're favorin'[N]
us. We're making good time to Opistia.[A][N]
I'd guess we're another four or five days[N]
out at most.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent![A][N][OpenMidRight]
...So, what be your plan, anyway?[N]
Draggin' Opistia into this war?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's... not quite how I'd phrase it.[A][N]
But I suppose you could see it that way.[A][N]
While the Opistians are normally a[N]
pacifistic nation,[A] they've historically[N]
stepped in during major conflicts.[A][N]
I'd consider the Yg'stran invasion worthy[N]
of their consideration.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I suppose. Never been one for politics[N]
meself.[A] All o' my disputes are settled[N]
either with a sip o' ale or a good clubbin'.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...You could just call this war[N]
a large scale [OpenQuote]clubbin'.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It be more complex, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...We've nothin' better to do.[N]
I'd say give yer allies a holler.[A][N]
Dependin' on how the cards fall, these may be[N]
yer last peaceful moments for a long while.[A][N]
I'm sure everyone's got a lot on[N]
their minds.[A] That's what I do wit'[N]
me crew, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good idea, captain.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
(If I remember correctly, there's also[N]
some pirate-run shops on this boat.)[A][N]
(It wouldn't hurt to see what[N]
they have available.)[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Ah, Blair. How are you[N]
holding up?[A][X]

##I3StefanConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Milady! Have you been keeping well?[N]
It's truly an honor to see you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I should be saying that to you, Stefan.[N]
You've been such a valuable ally![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, milady.[N]
But I'm just doing my duty.[A][N]
I know I can push myself further[N]
and serve us all the better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you say so. Just don't[N]
overdo it, please.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No promises, milady![A][N]
Anyway, I'm off to run four hundred[N]
laps around the deck of the ship![A][N]
A pleasure seeing you![A][X]
