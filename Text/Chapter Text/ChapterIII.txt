[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred][OpenRight]
[...]How in the hell?[A][N]
This[...] shouldn't be possible.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're right, friend.[N]
This defies logic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Calm yourselves. I know what to do.[A][N]
[...]Ahem! Please contact Retina in the[N]
Discord if you see this message![A][N]
Either the game's broken or you're[N]
an LTC legend.[A] Either way, he'd like[N]
to have a word with you.[A][N]
Now back to your scheduled[N]
Tarquin moment.[A][X]

##V3Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
We've cleared this place out.[N]
But what of their leader?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll talk to him. [...]Alone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you sure that's wise?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not really. But I want to[...][N]
understand him.[A][N]
And I need him to be willing[N]
to talk to me for that.[A][N]
Just the two of us. No weapons.[N]
No trap to lead him into.[A][N]
[...]If things get bad, I'll[N]
yell out to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Be careful.[N]
[...]Please.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Don't undersell me.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I'll be alright. I promise.[A][X]

##V3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What in the hell do you want?[N]
Do you wish to spit in my face?[A][N]
Kick a broken man while he's down?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hardly.[N]
I just wish to understand you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is there to understand?[N]
You're fighting for Dalst.[A][N]
And Dalst's treatin' us like[N]
some kind of spoils.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're a proud land of warriors[...][A][N]
And Dalst's tearing all of that[N]
apart[...][A] Just let us decide[N]
a new emperor and be done with it![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That general of yours thinks he[N]
knows how to run our land[...][A][N]
Thinks that the best way to solve[N]
a problem is to throw men at it![A][N]
The emperor screwed up, and died[N]
for it already.[A] Why can't we just[N]
go back to the way things should be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Does this justify[N]
these prison camps?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't try to take the high ground.[A][N]
It's just what Dalst deserves.[N]
What everyone who stands for it deserves.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, now what? You gonna[N]
kill me yet?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I have no reason to.[A][N]
Even though I don't agree with[N]
your methods,[A] I understand[N]
your nation's struggle.[A][N]
And[...] I do wish to somehow[N]
help find a way forward.[A][N]
Knowing all of this, I[...] don't think[N]
I can blindly fight Dalst's battles.[A][N]
My group needs to return to how[N]
things used to be.[A][N]
Fighting for the common man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sounds nice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're a man of remarkable[N]
skill.[A] And I can tell you wish[N]
to help your fellow man.[A][N]
This may sound absolutely mad[...][N]
But would you wish to-[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadNeillstrom][Event]//mute
Well, then. There you are.[A][N][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][Event]//play his theme
[...]You've done well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What treachery is this?[N]
This was all a trap, wasn't it?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What? No! [...]What is the[N]
meaning of this, Neillstrom?[A][N][OpenRight]
It's simple. I came to check up[N]
on your progress.[A][N]
I see you've captured their leader.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]That we have.[A][N][OpenRight]
I appreciate it. Truly.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]And now justice[N]
can be carried out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] You bastard![A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
Rebel. For your crimes against the[N]
Dalstian Alliance[...][A][N][Event]//mute music here
I sentence you to death.[A][X]
//screen goes black, murdery sound effects play

##V3Ending3
[OpenFarRight][LoadViridian][OpenRight][LoadNeillstrom]
[...]Well, then. That's that.[N]
Now, about payment.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What[...] What in the[N]
hell did you do?![A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNeillstrom]
[...]I executed a dangerous criminal.[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
Dangerous criminal?[A][N]
He was an unarmed man![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. But who knows what he'd[N]
have done if he got arms again?[A][N]
And you can't change the fact that[N]
he took captive Dalstian citizens.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]In any case, let this be[N]
behind us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I don't think I can.[A][N]
[...]We're leaving. Keep your[N]
blood-tainted coin.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Very well.[A][X]

##V3Ending4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]I understand. We depart[N]
once everyone's ready.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I feel like I tricked that[N]
poor man into his death.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Even if you had a weapon,[N]
could you have stopped him?[A][N]
Could you have stopped Neillstrom?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I understand feeling responsible,[N]
but know that it's not your fault.[A][N]
For what it's worth, we attempted[N]
to stop his approach.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I appreciate that.[A][N]
It's just[...] unfair.[A][N]
Nobles like him don't care for[N]
lives they don't control.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What do we do now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] don't know.[A][N]
But we'll find something[...][N]
That's all we can do.[A][X]
//more here?


##V3_Civ1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan2]
Whew! You're really somethin',[N]
alright.[A] I'm gonna go hide in[N]
that there tree until yer' done.[A][N]
Be careful, though. I saw some[N]
lasses preparin' in that building.[A][N]
And they'll likely be out any minute[N]
now to rip your group to shreds.[A][N]
[...]Godspeed.[A][X]

##V3_Civ2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman2]
You saved me! You're truly[N]
a dashing hero.[A][N]
I'm gonna escape while they're[N]
distracted by the battle.[A][N]
I think I saw some wyverns[N]
over the river a bit ago[...][A][N]
So, if you could[...] Take them[N]
down for me? Please?[A][X]

##V3_Civ3
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman4]
Thank you so much! Don't worry[N]
about me now. I'll keep running.[A][N]
But as thanks, let me give[N]
you some information.[A][N]
Some higher-up here ordered for[N]
some horseback reinforcements.[A][N]
They'll likely arrive from the[N]
south any minute now.[A][N]
[...]Thanks again![A][X]

##V3_Civ4
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan5]
Freedom! What a glorious day![A][N]
I'd best be off before they[N]
notice that I'm gone.[A][N]
By the by, I heard there's some[N]
reserve troops in these forts.[A][N]
If they haven't come out yet,[N]
you can get the drop on them![A][X]

##V3ReynardBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
Hmph. That bastard couldn't[N]
even show up himself.[A][N]
Had to hire some mercs.[A][N]
Well, I'll show 'em the[N]
might of Yg'stra![A][N]
We'll never back down![A][X]

##V3ReynardCallumBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
I know you. Traitorous scum.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
[...]Good to know. Doesn't change[N]
where my sword's going.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
If we had you, perhaps this[N]
rebellion would be over.[A][N]
[...]You're a strong man.[A][N]
But you'll die a deserter.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
Perhaps. But I'll also die[N]
far away from this hellhole.[A][X]

##V3ReynardDefeat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
You[...] really think[...][N]
this'll stop me[...]?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]Take him alive.[N]
We need not kill him.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
[...]You[...] scum[...][N]
Kill me[...] like a man[...][A][X]

##V3ReynardDefeatAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
What[...] in the hell[...][N]
do you think[...] you're[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]I'm capturing you.[N]
You're not dying today.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard]
[...]You[...] scum[...][N]
Kill me[...] like a man[...][A][X]

##V3_Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]We're nearly at the location[N]
Neillstrom gave us.[A][N]
Let us hope it's accurate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[...] unfortunate, that we[N]
have to come to blows.[A][N]
It almost feels wrong to put[N]
down freedom fighters like this.[A][N]
But at the same time[...][A][N]
Holding prisoners like this[N]
is simply unjustifiable.[A][N]
[...]We're doing this for them.[N]
Not for Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And if Dalst was lying?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, obviously we'd turn around[N]
and ask what the hell is going on.[A][N]
In any case, we signed a contract.[N]
And now it's our duty.[A][N]
After this, though[...] I wanna get[N]
away from nobility.[A][N]
Return to our roots.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm glad to hear that.[A][X]

##V3_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
Reynard! We've got company below![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hmph. So we do. If they're here,[N]
they're here for the prisoners.[A][N]
Well, then. We'll spring them a[N]
nice ol' trap, I say.[A][N]
First thing's first. Let me[N]
get in position.[A][X]

##V3_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidLeft]
What was I sayin'? [...]Right.[A][N]
As they free the prisoners,[N]
spring our men on them.[A][N]
We'll not bow down to Dalst[N]
until they recognize us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Keep yourself alive,[N]
captain.[A] You're the heart[N]
of this resistance.[A][X]

##V3_Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
Remember, everyone! Our goal's[N]
to free the prisoners![A][N]
If you see a camp gate and[N]
have a key, crack it open![A][N]
Only once we've freed everyone[N]
should we seize their main building.[A][N]
Wilhelm's squad should be[N]
converging shortly.[A][N]
And remember, it's getting dark.[N]
Keep your wits about you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]They haven't quite noticed[N]
our presence yet.[A][N]
If we need to shift our formation,[N]
I can carry people over the river.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. We'll send[...][N]
five on each side.[A][N]
Get ready, friends. Today,[N]
we fight for freedom![A][X]

##V3_Arrival
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred][OpenMidLeft]
Hold. I believe we're here.[A][N][OpenRight]
Yup. That's an encampment.[A][N]
[...]And that's a guy who's[N]
lookin' like he'll stab me.[A][N]
Well, remember the plan.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Isn't the plan just [OpenQuote]don't die[CloseQuote]?[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
It's a damn fine plan, Manfred.[A][N]
I'd bet my life on it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I've had more than my fill of life.[N]
I'll be your shield, gentlemen.[A][N][OpenRight]
Gentle? That's a stretch.[N]
For both of us.[A][N]
And we can hold our own.[A][N]
[...]Especially with the looming[N]
promise of payday.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll be alright, Argent.[N]
Keep yourself alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course. Let our[N]
deeds be remembered.[A][N][OpenRight]
That's the spirit.[A][N]
Though, hopefully by tonight[N]
I'll have forgotten them,[A][N]
and it'll just be me, a nice[N]
bottle, and a stack of cards.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Just make sure to save some[N]
for me, friend.[A][X]

##V3_DoorsRemain
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
[...]What am I doing? There's[N]
still work to be done.[A][X]

##V3_NoDoorsRemain
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
I think we got everyone.[N]
Now, let's wrap this up.[A][X]
