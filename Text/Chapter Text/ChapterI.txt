##ViridianArcPrimer
Welcome to the Viridian Chapters![A][N]
Similar to the Zeke Chapters,[N]
you'll focus on a small party.[A][N]
A few notes for Viridian's maps:[A][N]
-Viridian has a convoy that can hold[N]
up to 50 items,[A] as well as a[N]
separate gold supply from Blair.[A][N]
-Just like Zeke's maps, any unit[N]
death will be a game over.[A][N]
-You will get access to base[N]
preparations starting next map.[A][N]
-Some maps may force deploy large[N]
amounts of units.[A] Remember that[N]
you can rearrange force-deploys.[A][N]
Thanks for sticking with this hack[N]
for so long, and good luck![A][X]

##V1ElcorianPanic
[OpenRight][LoadNeillstrom][OpenFarRight][LoadCiraweiss][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Tarquin. I[...] need[N]
a favor.[A][N]
Can you[...] spare me[N]
some Dalstian troops?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Something's[...] come up. And I need[N]
some cleanup.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]That's quite vague. In any case,[N]
I unfortunately cannot help.[A][N]
The army's got its hands full[N]
keeping order in Yg'stra.[A][N]
And that's not to mention our[N]
fruitless search for the Arkhinal.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn[...] I see. Ethyl?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That includes Ciraweissian troops.[N]
What did you do, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd rather[...] not say.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Well, then. How much coin[N]
do you have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose mercenaries might[N]
be the only way out of this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Here, come with me. I've a[N]
registry of merc groups.[A][N]
[...]If you tell me more,[N]
I'll cover some costs.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That is alright. I've the[N]
wealth that I'll need.[A][N]
I'd rather keep this[...][N]
on the down low.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Suit yourself.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Well. Maybe that's what I need[N]
in Yg'stra too, then.[A][N]
I don't[...] have enough power to[N]
keep order.[A] [...]I need order.[A][X]

##V1TheJob
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]Viridian. We've a message.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadSoldier2]
I bring a message from Elcorian of Dalst![A][N]
He seeks your aid on an urgent and[N]
private matter.[A][N]
If you intend to aid him, meet at[...][A][N][MoveRight]
this location.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What's his offer?[A][N][OpenRight]
70000. Up front. More to[N]
come if you impress him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see. We'll[...] have to[N]
consider this. Thank you.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's[...] more than the past[N]
several months combined.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Secret business with a head honcho[N]
of the Dalstian Alliance.[A][N]
And with such a large price.[A][N]
This feels[...] suspicious.[N]
But[...] We need the money.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, we'll discuss with the[N]
rest tonight.[A][N]
And if they're alright with it[...][N]
And you're alright with it[...][A][N]
I shall face it alongside you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sounds good to me.[A][N]
[...]Let's just hope this isn't[N]
something sinister.[A][X]

##V1EndingClarqueAlive
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRift][OpenLeft][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric][OpenRight][LoadViridian]
[...]I believe we're done here.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Everyone's alive. That's[...][N]
always a relief.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Indeed. Good work today,[N]
Rift. You too, Estelle.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It was nothing for one[N]
of my calibre.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Indeed. 'Twas a spectacle[N]
in name only.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Is that a good thing?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadDean]
[...]I'd say. By the by,[N]
where're the others?[A][N][OpenRight]
If they're done cleaning[N]
up, they should be nearby.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadEliza]
Let's go, then. Don't wanna[N]
keep my brother waiting![A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse]
It will be nice to get some[N]
rest after a job well done.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well said.[A] Well, then.[N]
Onwards![A][X]

##V1EndingClarqueDead
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRift][OpenLeft][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric][OpenRight][LoadViridian]
[...]We're done here.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Everyone's[...] alive.[N]
That's[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
Are[...] you alright?[N]
I thought I recognized-[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Make sure everyone is well.[N]
We'll[...] meet the others.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]You sure, boss?[A][N][OpenLeft]
I think it would be for the best[N]
if we[...] step away, Rift.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
Very well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadDean]
I remember that man. He[...][N]
was a fine merc, once.[A][N]
I don't know fully of your[N]
history with him[...][A][N]
But you have my condolences.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Thanks, Dean.[A][N]
I'll[...] be fine.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It's the unavoidable truth[N]
of being a mercenary.[A][N]
Sometimes, you cut down a[N]
former ally.[A][N]
It hurts, but in the end[...][N]
We both chose this life.[A][N]
[...]He once told me that this[N]
life never gets easier.[A][N]
But that taking death in this[N]
manner[...] keeps us human.[A][N]
[...]In any case, we're needed.[N]
We can't lose sight of our duty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If[...] you say so. Just[...] let us[N]
know if you need an ear.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Thank you.[A][X]

##V1EndingReconvene
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDirk][OpenLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenRight][LoadViridian]
Aha! There you all are.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, well. If it isn't the[N]
boss themself.[A][N]
I presume all went smoothly?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I would say so.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Excellent. Same goes for us.[A][N]
Hardly a surprise, considering the[N]
talent at your employ.[A][N]
Well, then. If it's alright, I'm[N]
gonna go hit the bar with Manfred.[A][N]
G'day, all.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Brother![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Good to see you safe.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I suppose I can trust[N]
her with you, Virid.[A][N][OpenRight]
Trust me. Threat of your wrath is[N]
reason enough to keep her safe.[A][N]
Where're the others?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Callum and Argent are off at[N]
the armorer's,[A] and as for[N]
Rose[...] Who knows with her?[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadRose][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Ah.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadViridian]
Hey, Rose.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Good to see you, boss.[A][N]
Say, you got anything sweet?[N]
[...]Or money for anything sweet?[A][N][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Fine.[A][N][MoveLeft]
Here.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Thanks![A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]A small leak can sink[N]
a great ship.[A][N]
Or in this case, a great payoff.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
Ah, Viridian. I collected the[N]
other half of our payment.[A][N]
[...]I presume I'll have to detract[N]
5 gold for Rose.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'll[...] handle that. Just track the[N]
whole 10000 as equipment funds.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. The innkeeper said tonight's[N]
on the house.[A] We'll rest a day or[N]
two, then it's off to another job.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sounds good. Thanks for keeping this[N]
all straight, by the way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We're in this together.[A][N][OpenLeft]
For the rest of our lives.[A][X]

##V1NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Hmph. Mercs. When'll Mevion give[N]
a damn enough to defend itself?[A][N]
I mean[...] I'm not thankless.[N]
You're doing quite alright.[A][N]
I just ask why the hell it[N]
has to be this way.[A][X]

##V1SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman4]
I'm surprised you're up here.[N]
My house is real out of the way.[A][N]
[...]Frankly, I don't know why I[N]
even live here.[A][N]
Novelty, I guess. But it's such[N]
a pain to leave and come back.[A][N]
[...]Maybe it's time to move.[A][X]

##V1EastVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
Our saviors! Huzzah![A][N]
[...]Right? You're here to[N]
save us?[A][N]
Good! Well, then. Take our[N]
prized lance.[A] It's been rusting[N]
ever since the revolution.[A][N]
[...]Everyone in this village[N]
uses swords or axes now.[A][N]
So, uh[...] It's worthless[N]
to us.[A] But you can use[N]
it, I'm quite sure![A][X]

##V1WestVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
Why would Clarque[...][N]
Why would he do this?[A][N]
[...]Right, we should probably[N]
close ourselves up now.[A][N]
Thanks. Take this little trinket.[N]
It might bring you fortune.[A][N]
And, really[...] We all need[N]
some fortune these days.[A][X]

##V1RiftAscends
[OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
[...]That's it, fellas.[N]
You want a piece of me?[A][N]
Cause I think it's high time[N]
that I show you what I'm made of![A][N]
Well, then[...] HAVE AT ME![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]Ah, right. That.[A][N]
Still not quite sure where[N]
he gets that energy from.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Knock 'em dead, Rift.[A][X]

##V1ClarqueSpeaks
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
So[...] Mevion can't be bothered[N]
to keep their own safe.[A][N]
Putting lives in the hands of[N]
mercenaries.[A] I'd call that[N]
shameful[...][A] But I guess I'm[N]
hardly in a position for that.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Well, in any case.[N]
Deploy the reinforcements.[A][N]
Keep our foes under pressure.[A][X]

##V1ArrivalLTC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
Already finished? And they[N]
couldn't even leave any for me[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Truly a tragedy. In any case,[N]
let's let them know we're here.[A][X]

##V1Arrival
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
And so, the curtain ascends.[A][N]
Rift, it is our time to put[N]
on a spectacle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well said, Estelle. Looks like[N]
Virid's in a bit of a bind.[A][N]
But that's hardly an issue[N]
for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Do be mindful, mine companion.[N]
Recall why we're late, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So what if I got caught in a[N]
hunting trap?[A] Happens to[N]
the best of us from time to time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You got caught in a hunting trap,[A][N]
then proceeded to get accosted[N]
by a bear.[A][N]
And that's not mentioning[N]
falling into quicksand.[A][N]
How does one even find that[N]
in a swamp?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, at least the quicksand scared[N]
off the bear.[A] [...]You could've[N]
helped me.[A] Instead, you just stood[N]
there, laughing and taking notes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
When comedic inspiration strikes,[N]
one must exploit it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure. Anyway, enough rambling.[N]
Time to work.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Time to leave my mark.[A][X]

##V1ViridianRebuts
[OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]These're too coordinated[N]
for simple bandits.[A][N]
It's as if some manner of[N]
veteran is leading them[...][A][N]
In fact[...] I think I might[N]
recognize these formations.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] don't want to[N]
believe it, though.[A][X]

##V1Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
Well, my friend. We're finally[N]
in the money.[A] How's it feel?[N]
No discount inns for us now![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You know I've been managing our[N]
finances tightly.[A] We've had[N]
premium inn money for months.[A][N]
I just felt it prudent not to[N]
waste it all in an instant.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Besides, it builds character.[N]
And you need character, Viridian.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
What's that supposed to mean?[A][N]
I'm a perfectly well rounded[N]
individual, Fred![A][N]
Besides, consider the rest of[N]
our company.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadChartreuse]
It's quite fine by me. I'd rather[N]
a cheap room than none at all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
See? Chartreuse has my back![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Though[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[...]And there's the[N]
imminent betrayal.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadEliza]
[...]I like comfy beds.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm glad we're of the[N]
same mind, Eliza.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadDean]
I appreciate the lightheartedness, but[N]
shouldn't we prepare for the job?[A][N]
Where'd Rift and Estelle run off?[A][N][OpenRight]
They're ahead scouting. We'll[N]
converge at the destination.[A][N]
I trust Rift's ability. And[...][N]
Estelle[...] Uh[...][A][N]
Look. She'll be fine.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I'll never understand some[N]
of your hiring decisions.[A][N]
I guess Eliza and Dirk were a package[N]
deal, and so were Rift and Estelle[...][A][N]
But can you explain that Opistian?[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Nope! Look, you try refusing a child[N]
that looks at you like that.[A][N]
[...]Was nearly convinced she'd[N]
try to stab me.[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Anyway. I believe we're near.[A][X]

##V1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian][OpenMidLeft]
It's been a while, Mevion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right[...] This place brings back[N]
memories.[A] [...]Not good ones, but[N]
that's beyond the point.[A][N]
Remember, everyone! We're being paid[N]
to clean out these raiders![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That reminds me. We got 10000 gold[N]
as a down payment.[A][N]
The other 10000 will come later.[N]
We should stock up here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We've been dealing with[N]
scraps ever since Couria.[A][N]
And as much as I love this bow,[N]
it's[...] seen better days.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anyway. I shall take point.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadDean][OpenMidRight]
Dean, run 'em through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadEliza][OpenMidRight]
Eliza, keep us healthy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse][OpenMidRight]
[...]Stay close to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Be ready for anything.[A][N]
Once Rift and Estelle converge,[N]
we'll be in a good position.[A][N][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]
([...]Wherever you are, Clarque[...][N]
I'll make you proud.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
Viridians[...] advance![A][X]

##V1ViridianClarqueConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque][OpenMidLeft]
Clarque[...] What are you doing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Viridian. Good to see[N]
my protege is well.[A][N]
I took a job. That's all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How could you? Don't you see[N]
what these brutes have done?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What of it?[A][N]
I have nothing left in[N]
this world.[A][N]
Nothing left tying me[N]
to this country.[A][N]
Do you remember my sons?[A][N]
They all threw themselves into[N]
battle, and they all died.[A][N]
Why should I deserve a peaceful[N]
end? A glorious end?[A][N]
No[...] This is[...] right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Listen to yourself. You've[...][N]
done so many great things.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You've taught me[...] so much.[A][X]

##ThreeYearsAgoLabel
3 years ago...[X]

##V1Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridianYoung][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We've failed him.[N]
We've failed everyone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It certainly[...][N]
could've gone better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does[...] Does it ever get easier?[A][N]
Having to kill so many?[N]
Our friends dying before us?[A][N]
Please[...] Tell me.[N]
It[...] has to.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]It doesn't. It never gets easier.[A][N]
But in a way[...][N]
That's a blessing.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It keeps you human. [...]You're something[N]
special.[A] 'Twould be a shame for you[N]
to lose yourself to heartlessness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks for everything, Clarque.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You can't throw in the towel[N]
just because you've screwed up once.[A][N]
Don't tell me that's your intent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not at all. I just[...][N]
need some time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright. I care about you.[N]
[...]Don't forget that.[A][X]

##V1ViridianClarqueConvo2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[...]I have nothing left, Viridian.[N]
My sons are gone.[A][N]
My pride is gone. At least let[N]
me die with a weapon in hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I refuse to strike you down.[N]
I'm sorry[...] old friend.[A][N]
I wish I could give you that[N]
mercy.[...][A] But I'm not strong[N]
enough, I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]So what, then? Are we gonna stare at[N]
each other until the end of time?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You've had ample time to strike[N]
me down.[A] And yet, you've held your[N]
weapons back.[A] You don't want this.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Retreat, and live. My friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Damn it[...] You're[...] You're[N]
right, Viridian.[A] [...]If I'm leaving,[N]
at least take this.[A][N]
You'll[...] find a use for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thank you.[A] Where shall[N]
you go, now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I[...] I don't know, anymore.[N]
But I'll find a way forward.[A][N]
And I'll pay you back someday.[A][X]

##V1ClarqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
I've lost everything.[A][N]
My family, my purpose,[N]
my pride[...][A][N]
But I'll at least go down[N]
with a blade at my side.[A][X]

##V1ClarqueViridianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian][CloseEyes]
[...]So it is you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque][CloseEyes]

this can end, now.[A][N]
[...]I'm sorry.[A][X]
