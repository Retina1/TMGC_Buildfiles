The Mugger[X]

##C7_Mugger
[OpenFarFarRight]
*Rustle! Rustle!*[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Um[...] Excuse me? Has a[N]
rat gotten into our convoy?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff]
*Rust-* Aw, crap.[N]
Guess I deserve this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]Are you the fabled[N]
convoy rat?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]What? No. I'm a burglar.[N]
Here to burgle you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see! You must be[N]
a dashing swordsman type.[A][N]
A noble man who embraces the[N]
world's darkness to fight it[...][A][N]
How exciting![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]I'm not a dashing anything.[N]
I'm a thief named Jeff.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me[...][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that a Lancereaver?[N]
Where'd you find it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]I stole it. From you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope. I'm sure we didn't[N]
have an extra lying around.[A][N]
What a spectacular weapon of choice![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha[...] Of course[...][N]
I can[...] definitely use it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We could always use another[N]
thief around in our army.[A][N]
Care to join us for the[N]
thrill of adventure?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]How many times do I have to explain?[A][N]
I'm NOTHING special! Just the gutter[N]
trash of Mevion![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be so hard on yourself.[A][N]
One man's gutter trash is another[N]
man's gutter treasure, after all![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]Fine. If it'll shut you up,[N]
I'll stick around.[A] Don't go crying[N]
when your gold goes missing.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Good one, Jeff! I know[N]
you'd never do that.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][...]Damn. Called my bluff like that.[A][N]
Well[...] Maybe this IS a sign.[N]
Maybe it's not too late for me.[A][N][ToggleMouthMove]
[CloseEyes]([...]It's always too late. There's[N]
nothing left for you.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
We'll see about that.[A][X]


##C7_Sam_Arin_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadSam][OpenMidLeft]
There you are, Sam. I'd been[N]
meaning to talk to you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]M-me[...]? What did I do wrong?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]Nothing. I just wanted to see[N]
how you've been adjusting.[A][N]
If I'm not wrong, you're of a[N]
noble house, correct?[A][N]
It's just interesting to see[N]
you choose to join us.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I see[...][N]
Well, you know[...][A][N]
The Barford name[...] doesn't mean much.[A][N]
Really, it's just a ceremonial house[...][N]
And I guess it bolsters Dalstian numbers.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Still, most wouldn't choose to leave[N]
that kind of life.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]When you're a noble of an[N]
unwanted house[...] You get lonely.[A][N]
I thought that maybe[...] the army would[N]
make me less so[...][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I suppose since we're talking[N]
now, your theory may be correct.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha[...] I guess so[...][N]
Thanks, Arin.[A][X]


##C7_Stefan_Josef_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Ho! Young man![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Finally noticed my skills, Sir Josef?[N]
I'd be honored to clash with you![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]What? No. I've noticed in these[N]
recent battles[...] You've been reckless.[A][N]
Charging headlong into the enemy.[N]
You'll get yourself killed like that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hardly! If you've seen my skills,[N]
you know I'm in no real danger.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's what they all say.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Who's [OpenQuote]they[CloseQuote]?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Every hotheaded fool who charged into[N]
an early grave.[A][N]
Look, I'm just concerned for you.[A][N]
Don't you want an impregnable shield[N]
such as myself by your side?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]And wait for them to come to us?[N]
Not a chance![A] A true knight charges[N]
ahead to defend the weak![A][N][CloseEyes]
To save[...] the[...] helpless[...][N]
The ones[...] you could[...] have saved[...][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][...]Apologies. Just[...] be careful, please.[A][N]
We'd all like everyone to come back alive.[A][X]


##C7_Rachael_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Well, Rach. Looks like the worst's[N]
come to pass.[A] Yg'stra's at our[N]
doorstep now.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Our king is a strong man.[A][N]
If worst comes to worst, I'd gladly[N]
lay down my life for him.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Funny. I'd rather live for him[N]
than die for him.[A][N]
But suit yourself.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]You know what I mean.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Of course I do. I'm dumb,[N]
not an idiot.[A] [...]Honestly, I'll[N]
miss the easy life.[A][N]
Sure, I was basically a glorified[N]
errand boy for the crown,[A][N]
but hey! Better than fighting[N]
in some war.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Then why are you here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Stubborn pride? A sense[N]
of duty?[A] Look, I can't explain[N]
the inner workings of Cassius.[A][N]
Besides, at this point, I'd just[N]
look bad if I left without you.[A][N]
And I know there's no chance[N]
you'd leave these fellas.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Duty is everything,[N]
after all.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, yeah. Just[...][N]
don't get yourself killed.[A][N]
Needlessly, that is.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]I'll see what I can do.[A][X]
