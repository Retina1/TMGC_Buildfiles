And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The mysteries of Holanis's fall[N]
have all been laid bare.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this, here? Writing?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's see what it says.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Listen, one who hears my cry.[N]
Heed the warnings of my tale.[A][N]
Our glorious land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Holanis.[N]
Led to ruin by man's ambition.[A][N]
Let these tragedies never again[N]
scar the land of Ulmaron.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's all it says. This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
can't be everything.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Where's the path forward?[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This panel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's sticking out a bit.[A][N]
Maybe if I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight]
Aha! It slid in![A][N]
And I think the path ahead[N]
is opening up now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'd best be careful.[N]
Who knows what lies ahead?[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] writing?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Listen, one who hears my cry.[N]
Heed the warnings of my tale.[A][N]
Our glorious land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Holanis.[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's all it says. This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
must be incomplete.[A][N]
How do we proceed, though?[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This panel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's misaligned.[A][N]
Maybe if I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight]
I see. It slid in.[A][N]
And I think that opened[N]
up the path ahead.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Stay cautious. New dangers[N]
may be before us.[A][X]

More writing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Holanis was a nation beyond all others.[N]
Of that, I am certain.[A][N]
Perhaps, then, that grandness is what[N]
led it down the path of ruin.[A][N]
Our greatest minds though to tame[N]
the heavens themselves,[A][N]
and to assert their will over all[N]
things within our realm.[A][N]
For that, they sought power.[N]
And for power, they sought legends.[A][N]
Legends of the sheer might held[N]
within the dragons roaming our wilds.[A][N]
They sought to shackle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
To harness that power.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And there's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveMidLeft] another switch.[A][N]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] could this mean?[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, tales of success don't move[N]
the hearts of man like tales of ruin.[A][N]
The premise was simple. Capture dragons[N]
and harvest their power via elder magic.[A][N]
While the prospect of controlling the[N]
dragons was considered,[A][N]
directly harvesting their power was[N]
determined to be more efficient.[A][N]
The procedure, however, went awry.[A][N]
As for why, we are left to theorize,[A][N]
though my theory is that the overwhelming[N]
energies caused a chain reaction,[A][N]
annihilating other nearby dragons,[N]
and thus causing a chain reaction.[A][N]
In any case, as untold amounts of energy[N]
permeated Holanis, all was wiped clean.[A][N]
Those who somehow managed to survive[N]
found themselves in a barren land.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Then how[N]
are they still alive?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We have to keep going.[N]
Learn all we can.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How do you explain the[N]

an answer soon.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Despite the calamity that befell Holanis,[N]
those who lived pressed onward.[A][N]
Some even believed that with just a[N]
bit of fine tuning,[A] the energies[N]
could be contained.[A][N]
Of course, the chain reaction led to[N]
the death of most of Ulmaron's dragons.[A][N]
Curiously, domesticated wyverns bred for[N]
human flight were spared:[A] perhaps the[N]
breeding process diluted their energies?[A][N]
In any case, Holanis's brightest were left[N]
in a ruined nation,[A] devoid of the dragons[N]
that were to be its salvation.[A][N]
In an act of desperation, the dwindling[N]
population created the Simulacrums.[A][N]
Artificial dragons meant to capture[N]
the power held by the real dragons.[A][N]
The Simulacrums would go on to spell[N]
the end for the last of Holanis.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Every dragon we've fought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They're all imitations?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is all so confusing.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even so, we carry on.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah, Girard. I was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] digging around,[N]
and I found some of your old notes.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
So you have. Forget that rubbish.[N]
'Twas but a fleeting dream.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
That's what I had thought, but the[N]
concept had stuck with me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And I had to refine it.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have a look.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You solved the problem?[N]
This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is amazing![A][N]
To think we can go beyond mere Simulacrums[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Creating genuine life from the departed![A][N]
This will change the world. I'm certain.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not without its flaws.[N]
But it's a start.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
You undersell yourself, friend. With this,[N]
our glorious future is finally within reach![A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] honor me, Girard. Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you[N]
quite sure this is right, though?[A][N]
There's some not quite noble implications[N]
to this whole[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] procedure.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
That there may be, but all shall be[N]
worth it. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'll see.[A][N]
And your name may perhaps go down[N]
in history.[A] The man who brought[N]
salvation unto mankind.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, Girard.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArbordia][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
This'll all be worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In any case, I must be off.[N]
There is much to be done.[A][X]
