Defeat the[N]
Brothers Ed.[X]

##Ch17_Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Their leaders are down, and it[N]
appears they have scattered.[A][N]
We shouldn't linger, though.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Right[...] As the red one[N]
said in his dying breath,[A][N]
we're likely not finished here.[A][N]
And that'll be more true the[N]
longer we stick around.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well, then. Lead the way, Zeke.[A][X]

##Ch17_BlairHollandaiseTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
Oi! Blue![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[...] Are you talking[N]
to me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, do ya see anyone else[N]
blue around these parts?[A][N]
Of course I'm talkin' to you![A][N]
Look, I'll be honest with ya.[N]
I'm not so fond of these brutes.[A][N]
So I'll tell ya what. I won't get[N]
in your way.[A] And you'll let me[N]
join up with ya after the battle.[A][N]
I'd say that's a fair deal.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What? [...]I guess if she's not[N]
going to fight us[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
What a strange woman.[A][X]

##Ch17_BlairHollandaiseFollowup
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
Blue! Ye dealt wit' them.[N]
I'm a woman o' my word.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see. Tell me,[N]
who are you, exactly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The name's Hollandaise.[N]
Don't question it.[A][N]
I've lived 'ere long as I[N]
can remember.[A][N]
And I'm sick and tired of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How do I know this isn't some[N]
trick?[A] For all I know,[N]
you'll rob us blind tomorrow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps.[A][N]
Look, I'll show you my worth[N]
on the battlefield.[A][N]
And, frankly, it's not like I[N]
could run off with much anyway.[A][N]
Worst you'd lose is a few thousand[N]
gold and some precious swords.[A][N]
Anyhoot, if that's all decided,[N]
I'm helpin' myself to rations.[A][N]
Good day, boss![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I guess she has a point.[N]
What's the worst that could happen?[A][X]

##Ch17_HollandaiseJoinsUnprompted
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
Hey! Pinky![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What?! Another bandit?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Waitwaitwaitwaiiiiit! I'm 'ere to[N]
join ye! Never liked that gang anyway.[A][N]
The name's Hollandaise, by the by.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And on what grounds should I let[N]
you accompany our army?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'll think of some.[N]
Later, I mean.[A][N]
Look, I'll show you my worth[N]
on the battlefield.[A][N]
Anyhoot, if that's all decided,[N]
I'm helpin' myself to rations.[A][N]
Good day, boss![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Why does this have to[N]
happen to me?[A][N]
[...]Well, I suppose if she acts out[N]
of line, we can take her on.[A][N]
We DO need all the allies we can get.[A][X]

##Ch17_BechamelRecruitsHollandaise
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise][OpenMidLeft]
Avast[...] I can't believe me eyes[...][N]
Do that be ye, Hollandaise?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Avast? That's all you can say, brother?[N]
After leavin' like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[...] I cannae apologize enough.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're the one who got to escape.[N]
Stowin' away wit' some merchant fools.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, whatever. You're still my[N]
flesh and blood.[A][N]
Who're ya traveling wit' now?[N]
Has your crew run far aground?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
It be a long story, but I'm wit'[N]
some nobility.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent. I'm coming with you.[N]
No promises I won't rob you blind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ye'd[...] really come wit' us?[A][N]
This[...] be the happiest day o'[N]
me life![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Save the waterworks, brother.[A][N]
I've got some bastards to cut through,[N]
and no connection stopping me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Aye[...] She's just as[N]
I remember 'er.[A][X]

##Ch17_BechamelAndHollandaiseCatchUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise][OpenMidLeft]
Avast[...] I can't believe me eyes[...][N]
Do that be ye, Hollandaise?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Avast? That's all you can say, brother?[N]
After leavin' like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[...] I cannae apologize enough.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're the one who got to escape.[N]
Stowin' away wit' some merchant fools.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, whatever. You're still my[N]
flesh and blood.[A][N]
And as it 'appens, I'll be travelin'[N]
with you now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Really? This[...] This be the[N]
happiest day o' me life![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I guess it's nice to[N]
see you again, brother.[A][X]

##Ch17_Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke]
Hm[...] If I'm reading this right,[N]
this should be the right way.[A][N]
The Great Aqueduct's still quite far[N]
south, but this is the fastest route.[A][N]
If that's not where we find what we[N]
seek[...][A] Well, there's more recorded[N]
landmarks than just it.[A][N]
But we'll see if it comes[N]
to that.[A][N]
Apologies that we can't go through[N]
Dalst, but that'd take too long.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's quite alright. Truth be told,[N]
I'm quite fascinated by the Lowlands.[A][N]
Living in such an adverse landscape[N]
as this one must be quite the experience.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]I'm sure those struggling to survive[N]
would appreciate your viewpoint.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]My bad. I'm sure there's more than I[N]
could ever know to life here.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Holanis has to deal with some of[N]
Loile's ashes, but this[...][A][N]
This is almost unfathomable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet, it's a reality for many.[N]
[...]I think I hear something.[A][N]
Be on your guard.[A][X]

##Ch17_Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadEddie][OpenRight][LoadEduardo][OpenFarRight][LoadEdward]
Well, well, well[...][N]
Boss! Do ya hear that?[A][N][OpenRight]
Why, yes, Ed. I do. We've got[N]
some fresh meat on the menu.[A][N]
What do you think, Ed?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Well, Ed-Boss, I think you're[N]
right. We've got us some scraps.[A][N]
Howzabout you, Holly?[A][N][OpenLeft][LoadHollandaise]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I said, howzabout you, Holly?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Cram it. I 'eard ya,[N]
loud an' clear.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, fellas. You know the drill.[N]
Move out and pick 'em clean![A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
Gotcha, boss! We'll bleed[N]
'em all dry![A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
Of course, boss! We'll[N]
wring 'em all out![A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
[...]Blast it, why am I still[N]
wit' these brainless punks?[A][N]
But, 'ey. Maybe these travelers'll[N]
'ave my ticket outta 'ere.[A][N]
Speakin' o' escape[...] I wonder[N]
how he's doin'[...][A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadEdward]
Oi! You comin'?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Aye, ye impatient dastard![A][X]

##Ch17_Opening3
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Up ahead. We've got unfriendly company.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I can't imagine them being too[N]
well organized.[A] If we take out[N]
their leader, we should be alright.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Yes, but[...] Which one's their leader?[N]
[...]I'd have to guess it's that one, but[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
There's two others that look just like him.[N]
Hm[...][A] Unfortunately, I think we'll have[N]
to take out all three of them.[A][N]
That'll hopefully be enough to[N]
put them to rout.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sounds good to me. Everyone,[N]
be on your guard.[A][N]
Our foes and this terrain[N]
are treacherous alike![A][X]

##Ch17_Ending2
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadJohan][OpenFarFarRight][LoadPtolemy]
[...]H-hello, subject 4A6- I mean[...][N]
I think I figured out their system[...][A][N]
The first three letters of your name[...][N]
Would they happen to be J-O-H?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
[...]That would[...] be correct.[N]
Tell me[...] What are you doing to us?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
I'm sorry. I wish I knew. I'm just[...][N]
I'm just a Holanian they conscripted.[A][N]
I don't[...] I don't know what[N]
any of this is for.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
[...]I see. Might I ask who[N]
exactly you are?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Of course. My name is Ptolemy.[N]
[...]Funny name, right?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
It's not too unusual.[N]
[...]I'm Johan.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
You and your friends[...] I wish[N]
there was something I could do[...][A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Busting us out would be too great[N]
a risk for us all, I'd imagine.[A][N]
For now[...] I think we need[N]
a kind of hope.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
I'll see what I can do, Johan.[N]
I'm sure one day, we'll escape.[A][N]
And then you can meet my friends![N][OpenFarFarLeft]
[...]That sounds[...] nice.[A][X]
//have the "They're all bees!" line pay off later (ch 22/23) so scene isn't undercut


##BechamelKillsHollandaise

##C17EddieHollandaiseBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEddie]
