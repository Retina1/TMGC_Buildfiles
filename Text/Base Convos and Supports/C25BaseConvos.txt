You still holding up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No need to worry about me, Desmond.[N]
[...]Truly. I'm alright now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to hear.[A][N]
I[...] know you had your concerns[N]
about who you truly are.[A][N]
Still might.[A] But you have served[N]
us above and beyond the call of duty.[A][N]
You've a special place in the heart[N]
of our lady,[A] and by extension,[N]
the hearts of all Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You speak too highly of me.[A][N]
If anybody deserves praise, it's you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It is but my duty. I have given my[N]
life to Aercolyn,[A] and I shall[N]
continue to do so until I die.[A][N]
That said, I don't plan on dying.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a relief.[A][N]
[...]Funny to think how different[N]
yet similar we truly are.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's the power of a worthy cause.[A][N]
Something I've learned in my time[N]
as our commander.[A][N]
The unruly hearts of men can be[N]
made as one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's[...] strikingly beautiful.[N]
I'll be sure to remember that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But enough waxing philosophical.[N]
We've much work to do.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
It's time to bring freedom to[N]
our homeland![A][X]

You continue to impress me.[N]
I'm truly surprised.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Guess being an errand boy was[N]
holdin' back my potential.[A][N]
I'll miss those days, but there's[N]
no going back now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, now that my skill's known[...][A][N]
Surely I wouldn't be able to get[N]
away with my old post anymore.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The way I see it, your duty might[N]
earn you a peaceful life.[A][N]
Once this conflict's over, Elba Cor[N]
will still need messengers.[A][N]
And you've proven your ability to[N]
take on an odd job.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Still[...] It'll feel kinda wrong to[N]
go from the action of the field[...][A][N]
Back to what once was normal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Indeed. Especially with the[N]
prince's return.[A][N]
But managing that's a skill as[N]
valuable as swinging an axe.[A][N]
And you can do both.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm truly touched, old man.[A][N]
You've well-earned a retirement[N]
yourself, I'd say.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll only retire when these old[N]
bones fail me completely.[A][N]
[...]No pressure to follow[N]
me in that path.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm truly glad. I like my[N]
bones as is.[A][X]

##C25_Emile_Simone_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
You still haven't answered[N]
my questions.[A][N]
I'm almost offended. But it's[N]
alright. They're quite nontrivial.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I prefer to avoid sacrifice.[A][N]
Especially when it comes to the[N]
lives of others.[A] It's not my[N]
choice to make.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Moral, I see. Not a surprise.[N]
They didn't get in your head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]They?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The ones at Jraeyan. They'll justify[N]
anything.[A] I should know. I was[N]
one of them.[A][N]
Maybe I still am at heart.[A][N]
[...]Do you trust me not to bring you all[N]
to ruin for the sake of some future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] can't say for certain.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That's why I like you, kid.[N]
You're not blind or ignorant.[A][N]
Maybe once this is done, we can[N]
co-author a paper.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Or has meeting your hero gone[N]
and backfired hard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll admit you're[...] different[N]
than in your dissertations.[A][N]
But I can tell we're both[N]
passionate for our craft.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Craft? For me, tearing into the[N]
world isn't a mere craft.[A][N]
It's a way of life. A state[N]
of being.[A] It is me.[A][N]
And I've learned much about[N]
you from our talks.[A][N]
You're an interesting man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] glad?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You should be.[A][X]

Greetings, Apollo.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Charley. Is there[N]
something you need of me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Forgive me if I'm overstepping[N]
any boundaries.[A] But I feel we've[N]
gone through[...] similar things.[A][N]
[...]Are you happy with who you are?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I've never been happier.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Didn't doubt that for a second.[A][N]
I[...] am content, myself.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]
If I may ask, what brought[N]
you to ask this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm happy with who I am.[N]
But I still feel a yearning.[A][N]
Is that selfish of me?[A][N]
Living as I wish, but still[N]
being unsatisfied?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd hardly say so.[A][N]
The search for identity's only[N]
one part of us.[A][N]
It's part of everyone, really.[A][N]
And once you know who you are,[N]
that's only just the beginning.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That makes me feel better.[N]
Thanks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. I'm glad to share[N]
my experiences.[A] Especially if[N]
they bring comfort to others.[A][X]

[...]I could swear we had more[N]
rations just yesterday[...][A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Our supply in general feels[N]
disorganized, lately[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadIan]
Hello, miss![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Gah![A][N][ClearFace][LoadBlair]
[...]A child? What[...] What[N]
are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Ian![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see. What are you[N]
doing here?[A][N]
Where are your parents?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I live by a big river![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Big river[...]? Don't tell me[...][N]
Do you mean in Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah! I saw dragons in[N]
the river![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]You've been with us since[N]
the Great Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I'd ask how you got along[N]
this far,[A] but I don't think[N]
that'll help anyone.[A][N]
We're getting you home as[N]
soon as we're done here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been playing around in[N]
these tents.[A] You have so[N]
many tasty snacks![A][N]
And so many cool swords![A][N][MoveMidRight]
Whoosh! Whoosh![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Please stay back.[A][N]
Don't come out on the[N]
field with us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But you guys look so cool[N]
fighting out there![A][N]
I wanna join![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's too dangerous for you.[N]
Please. Just hide here.[A][N]
We'll help you later, Ian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]I know I can fight![A][N]
[...]Maybe they'll accidentally[N]
let me onto the battlefield.[A][N]
And then they'll see that I'm[N]
a kid to fear![A][X]

##C25_Secret_Seller
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJake4]
Greetings, lassie! Glad to[N]
see you made it this far.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hello there. What's this[N]
outfit supposed to be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No clue. Anna told me that someone[N]
would probably find it funny.[A][N]
But that's not what I'm here[N]
to discuss.[A] It's time for[N]
another patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's in a very fort-uitous[N]
location![A] Good luck gettin' to[N]
it without some help from a flier.[A][N]
Course, there's a lot of fortuitous[N]
places that you can't walk to[...][A][N]
So I guess you'll have to check[N]
them all![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's barely even a hint![A][N]
[...]I'm truly amazed you've had[N]
any customers besides us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My girlie truly treads the road to ruin.[N]
Financial ruin, that is.[A][N]
But she always comes out ahead. So I[N]
gotta just trust her instincts.[A][N]
Anyhoot, I'll see ya! Good luck[N]
reclaiming your home, and all that![A][X]
