##UntoTheEndArin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]To think we've come so far[N]
from fending off rebels.[A][N]
I won't say that it's always[N]
been a smooth road,[A] but it's[N]
one I can appreciate being on.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
It brought us closer together,[N]
for one.[A] And without me, I[...][N]
shudder to think where you'd be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I prefer to look forward.[A][N]
Especially since looking forward,[N]
I know you're by my side.[A][N]
[...]Not that you wouldn't be.[N]
But this is[...] different.[A][N]
I[...] I'm not sure what to call[N]
what we were before.[A][N]
But I know what you are now.[A][N]
You're who I wish to spend[N]
every moment of my life with.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing would make me happier.[A][N]
You've already[...] given my life meaning.[N]
I'd be glad to give it back to you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We'll discover what the rest of[N]
our lives mean together.[A][N]
In the world we create through our[N]
victory today.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]As I always have, I shall fight[N]
with all that I am capable of.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for everything, Blair.[A][X]


##UntoTheEndPoly
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]It's hard to believe everything[N]
that's happened recently.[A][N]
Both the good and the bad.[A][N]
These times have been[...] trying[N]
like none I've ever known.[A][N]
But the things I've done[...][A][N]
The people that I've met and[...][N]
grown to love.[A][N]
[...]I might truly be the luckiest[N]
woman alive.[A] [...]To be able to[N]
say that is[...] miraculous.[A][N]
[...]I don't know what the future[N]
will bring for me. For us.[A][N]
But I'm[...] excited.[A][N]
To have a chance to experience[N]
a new day alongside them[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]It's the greatest thing that[N]
I could ever ask for.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Alright, Blair. No more time for[N]
reflection.[A] You've got a world to win.[A][X]


##UntoTheEndNatasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Was there ever any doubt we'd[N]
be the ones to get this far?[A][N]
Me with my strength, you with[N]
your[...] everything.[A][N]
Nothing can ever hold us back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh[...] You've always been like[N]
this, Natasia.[A] Nothing's ever[N]
been able to keep you down.[A][N]
It's[...] inspiring to see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've come too far and done too[N]
much to ever give up now.[A][N]
[...]And now that I have you, that's[N]
absolutely never going to change.[A][N]
You know I'll do anything to make[N]
you happy, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then let us survive,[N]
and let us win.[A][N]
Let us move unto a life[N]
after this. Together.[A][X]

##UntoTheEndAvan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Part of me feels like our[N]
journey's only just begun.[A][N]
Guess it's true. Time flies.[A][N]
[...]I can see the entire world[N]
down there,[A] and yet I'd still[N]
rather look at you.[A][N]
[...]It's truly unfair that we[N]
must continue to fight.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Once we're finished today, we'll[N]
hopefully never have to again.[A][N]
We can just live. For the world.[N]
And for each other.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've[...] never enjoyed warfare.[A][N]
But if it'll let me stay by your side,[N]
I will fight any adversary.[A][N]
You've inspired[...] a strength,[N]
within me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And you've one in me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What are we waiting for, then?[A][N]
We'll stand together, and we'll[N]
triumph together. Now and forever.[A][X]

##UntoTheEndYuyu
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn. Guess it is.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]That all?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was just curious what you[N]
wanted to come next.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm. [...]Nothing yet. I'll keep[N]
you updated.[A] Honestly, much[N]
as I thrive on chaos and despair,[A][N]
I[...] wouldn't mind some peace.[A][N]
Some rest.[A] Some nothing.[A][N]
Been through a hell of a lot in[N]
my life. Especially lately.[A][N]
Wouldn't mind a good few weeks[N]
to just[...] relax with you.[A][N]
Well-earned rest.[A][N]
First, though. Gotta go give[N]
Girard what he deserves.[A][N]
[...]Won't be easy, but we'll[N]
be fine.[A] We're simply too[N]
powerful to lose![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're[...] You're right.[N]
We'll prevail. I know it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What're you waiting for, then?[A][N]
Go and show our enemies why they[N]
should fear you, my love![A][X]

##UntoTheEndEstelle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In a sense, perhaps.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But something grander[N]
is truly about to begin.[A][N]
[...]The rest of our lives.[A][N]
We shall win the day and bask[N]
in the happiness we earned.[A][N]
Perhaps one day, the troubadours[N]
shall sing of us.[A] The lady[N]
and her lady.[A] The pair that[N]
could triumph over all.[A][N]
[...]That's what I like to do in the[N]
face of the unknown, at least.[A][N]
Tell myself that all will be fine[N]
by dreaming of that tomorrow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's a lovely dream. And I know[N]
we can make it reality together.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, my lovely. That is the[N]
art of my craft.[A] Letting the[N]
dreams of us all take shape.[A][N]
And I shall do all I can to[N]
make our dream real.[A][X]

##UntoTheEndZeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is. Do[...] you think[N]
we'll make a difference?[A][N]
I just sometimes fear to think[...][N]
What if this all means nothing?[A][N]
What if tomorrow, there's another[N]
existential threat like Girard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then we'll triumph over them.[N]
We've come too far to not.[A][N]
And we've clearly proven our[N]
ability to overcome trials.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right. I'm just[...][N]
I worry too much.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing's wrong with that.[A][N]
We're all concerned over what[N]
the future will bring.[A][N]
[...]We just have to bravely step[N]
ahead into it anyway.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I know that we can make[N]
whatever future we wish for.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]We can. [...]Thanks for[...][N]
Well, everything, really.[A][N]
Your leadership, your might[...][N]
Most of all, for being a friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Zeke. We're stronger[N]
than the sum of our parts.[A][N]
And that strength is from[N]
the bond we share.[A][N]
Together, we'll carve a[N]
path to tomorrow![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha[...] That we will.[A][X]

##Final_Sam_Charley_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley][OpenMidLeft]
Charley. I've[...] made up my mind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
About your birthright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I don't wish to claim it.[A][N]
I've realized how much I admire[N]
you and your freedom.[A][N]
I don't want to give that up if[N]
I have the chance to take it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A respectable choice.[A][N]
I'm guessing from how you[N]
phrased that,[A] you intend[N]
to stick with me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If that's alright with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course. You're a pleasure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]T-Thanks.[A][N]
[...]Could[...] Could I be[N]
even more than that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What[...] do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] make me want to be better.[N]
Stronger. More confident.[A][N]
[...]I[...] I want to be more than[N]
just friends with you, Charley.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh. [...]Oh.[A][N]
Well, I'd be more than[N]
happy to oblige.[A][N]
You're[...] quite dear to me[N]
as well.[A] I hadn't imagined[N]
in a romantic sense,[A][N]
but the more I think on it[...][A][N]
The more it feels right.[A][N]
[...]You and I. Yeah.[N]
I like that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad.[A][N]
And I[...] I never want[N]
tihs moment to end.[A][X]

##Final_Ptolemy_Johan_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJohan][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
We're[...] finally at the end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Soon[...] we can finally rest.[A][N]
[...]Where do you plan to go?[N]
Back to Holanis, I presume?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I was thinking I'd go[N]
wherever you went.[A][N]
If[...] that's alright[N]
with you, I mean.[A][N]
I wouldn't wanna be[N]
a bother to you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You could never bother me,[N]
Ptolemy.[A] You're one of[N]
the kindest people I know.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You've[...] made this all[N]
worth surviving.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Me? I'm hardly[...] that much.[A][N]
[...]Your resilience inspired me[N]
too. Back in Jraeyan.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It[...] wasn't easy. But I knew that[N]
if you could hold out hope[...][A][N]
Then surely I could.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
That's why I[...] I don't[N]
want to leave you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I never want to leave[N]
your side, either.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You're[...] You're my light.[N]
My hope in the darkness.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And you[...] are mine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Whatever comes, we'll[N]
face it together.[A][X]

##Final_Josef_Athena_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJosef][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena][OpenMidLeft]
Athena. Mind if I ask your[N]
plans for after this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hardly had anything exciting.[A][N]
Will probably just return to[N]
business as normal in Opistia.[A][N]
[...]And you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, that's the challenge.[A][N]
Thought I'd just wanna get back[N]
to life in Dalst,[A] but it's[N]
not quite that simple now.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indecision doesn't suit you.[N]
Tell me what's the matter.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, about that. It's[...] you.[N]
You simply won't leave my mind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Ah. I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I know I'd regret it the rest of my[N]
life,[A] if we went our separate paths[N]
without me saying anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][ToggleSmile]Alright. Come to Opistia, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Wait[...] Huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
If you think you'll regret not[N]
acting on any feelings,[A][N]
then act on them. We'll see[N]
where they take us.[A][N]
[...]You've a fascinating man, Josef.[N]
I've grown fond of you myself.[A][N]
Why don't we see if there's[N]
anything more between us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If[...] If you're sure, I'd[...][N]
I'd truly appreciate that chance.[A][N]
I think we'll be right for[N]
each other. [...]I hope.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've made it this far.[N]
You're doing something well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I guess I am.[A][N]
[...]Ah! Of course, before[N]
any talk of life together[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
We must triumph.[N]
And we shall.[A][X]

##Final_Charley_Toddsworth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCharley][OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Toddsworth. You don't[N]
want any regrets, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I want those?[N]
They're for losers.[A][N]
[...]Why you askin'?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just making sure. Your music[...][N]
I think it can do wondrous things.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]About that. I[...] I don't think[N]
I'm cut out for that life.[A][N]
I can play a tune like nobody[N]
else, but my words[...][A][N]
They're crass. Coarse. [...]Gods, that[N]
feels wrong to admit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How about I write them?[A][N]
I'm well studied. Well written.[N]
Well spoken.[A] I'm quite sure[N]
I could do your music justice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] you sure? Chaining yourself[N]
to Toddsworth like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I already said I'd transcribe your[N]
work to sheet music.[A] This isn't[N]
all that much more commitment.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right, right.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just[...] overwhelming.[N]
Someone believing in me.[A][N]
[...]God damn it. I'm pathetic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you think that of yourself,[N]
then fight to change that.[A][N]
You're an odd man. But you're[N]
also a good man.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]You[...] mean that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course. You with music,[N]
me the words[...][A][N]
We can make it big.[A][N]
To borrow from your [OpenQuote]crass[CloseQuote][N]
vocabulary,[A] who the fuck[N]
is going to stop us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright. [...]Alright![N]
You[...] You got me excited.[A][N]
The world's our oyster.[A][N]
We'll go down in history.[A][N]
I know I said that before, but[N]
I[...] really mean it now.[A][N]
I've[...] never been more sure[N]
of anything in my life.[A][N]
[...]Here's to us![A][X]

##Final_Zeke_Hyperius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Hyperius. I wanted to formally[N]
thank you for everything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is my pride to serve you[N]
along your path.[A][N]
[...]Are you well prepared?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For this battle? I well[N]
and truly hope so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not just for today. We will[N]
overcome Arbordia.[A][N]
I am certain of that.[A][N]
I speak of what comes after[N]
this battle.[A] Are you[N]
ready for the world to change?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] I don't know.[A][N]
[...]I don't think I'll be[...][N]
the king Elba Cor needs.[A][N]
[...]I don't know if anyone[N]
could ever be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I trust in your ability.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Many do. And that's part of[N]
the problem.[A] I've hardly[...][N]
earned your respect as king.[A][N]
And yet you and others will[N]
sing my praises.[A][N]
This isn't anything against[N]
you, Hyperius.[A][N]
But I[...][A][CloseEyes] I need more time[N]
to think about this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You've brought up similar[N]
concerns before.[A][N]
[...]Are[...] you certain you[N]
wish to take the throne?[A][N]
[...]No, let me rephrase that.[N]
Do you wish to take the throne?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Deep down[...] I[...][N]
don't think I truly do.[A][N]
[...]I think Elba Cor should[N]
be for the people.[A][N]
By the people.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]An admirable notion.[A][N]
[...]If you wish to be the one[N]
to bring upon that change,[A][N]
I shall guide your hand as[N]
I oft have.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You[...] You will? Even if it[N]
ends the monarchy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am a man dedicated to you[N]
and your father.[A][N]
Whatever path you choose,[N]
I shall support it.[A][N]
[...]All this said, it's likely[N]
you'd have to take the throne,[A][N]
if you wish to ultimately[N]
bring an end to it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] understand. [...]I know this[N]
is a lot. Especially now.[A][N]
But[...] Thank you for[N]
hearing me out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anything, Your Highness.[A][N]
Naturally, though, we must first[N]
triumph in today's battle.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Let us march unto victory![A][X]
