Seize the[N]
throne.[X]

##Ch3_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're finally here. It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a lot more intimidating, now.[A][N]
Leading this charge, that is.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]We've had several days to prepare.[A][N]
You'd think Dalst would send more aid[N]
than a tiny sum of troops.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It'd be nice, but I'm just glad[N]
Elcorian gave us some gold.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ever the optimist. Anyway,[N]
we should prepare to strike.[A][N]
We won't go unnoticed much longer now.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds good with me.[A][X]

##Ch3_Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenLeft]
Have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Have we done it?[N]
Have we won?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]It appears we have.[A][N]
I believe it would be prudent to[N]
return to Arbordia,[A][N]
and report what's happened.[A][N]
With more support from Dalst, we could[N]
likely push deeper into Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadLazarus][Event]You shall report to nobody today.[A][N][MoveMidRight][Event]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Mere children took you down, Helga?[N]
How disappointing.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]A-are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] their commmander?[A][N]
Why did Yg'stra attack Dalst? What happened[N]
to those in the barracks!?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You dare question me? Do you[N]
realize your position?[A][N]
You stand before history's greatest:[N]
Lazarus, of Yg'stra![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Blair, we have to run.[A][N]
We can't possibly stand[N]
against this man now.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, you're right.[N]
There will always be another chance.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]So, you DO value your lives.[A][N]
Let's make this sporting, then. It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
satisfying, after all, if there's no struggle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]Sir Lazarus! They're escaping![N]
Your orders?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Let them run. Only pursue on my orders.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]But, sir- the orders were to take as[N]
many alive as possible![A] Surely we can[N]
capture them now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Did you mishear me?[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]The only orders you heed are MY direct orders.[N]
And I say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we feed them false hope.[A][N]
Young lordling[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Value whatever time[N]
you have left.[A] Know you're nothing[N]
but a stepping stone towards Elba Cor.[A][X]


##Ch3_Sam_Joins
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
Please, wait up![N]
You're Lady Blair, correct?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's me![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right. My name is Sam.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] recently recruited into[N]
the Dalstian army.[A][N]
They felt you'd need backup.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Chose me and some other guy.[A][N]
Where is he, anyway?[A][N]
You'd think a man in heavy armor[N]
wouldn't beat an agile young woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Anyway, I'm good with a bow.[N]
Relatively speaking.[A] I just picked[N]
it up, but I'm already skilled, I think.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Glad to have you here![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]One more thing.[A][N]
According to Dalstian intelligence,[N]
there's some ballistae here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] They'll easily outrange us,[A][N]
and I'd imagine they have enough ammunition[N]
to never run out before we die[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We'll have to prioritize them.[N]
Thanks for the tip, Sam![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly! Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't leave[N]
me behind, please.[A][X]

##Ch3_Josef_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Ah! Would you happen to be Lady Blair?[N]
The name's Josef. Pleasure to meet you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume you're the other soldier[N]
Dalst sent? I've already met Sam.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Sam. What a character.[N]
Young, but she's got spirit.[A][N]
Of course, I just had to rush ahead.[A][N]
After all, if there's anyone who can hold[N]
those Yg'strans off, it's me.[A][N]
Try as they may, they'll never breach[N]
my rock-solid armor![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see, I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But what if I did this?[A][MoveMidLeft][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Eeep![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Milady, I ask you not joke like that.[N]
Magic is no laughing matter.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Apologies.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though, that was pretty funny.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]If you consider doing that again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Please don't do that.[A][X]

##C3HelgaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga]
You think you're tough?[A][N]
Well, I've never lost a[N]
battle before-[A][N]
and that's not gonna change[N]
any time soon![A][X]

##C3HelgaDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga][ToggleSmile]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My first loss[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
No matter[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
General[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Lazarus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
will be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] seeing you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C3VillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Hello there! Wanna play with me?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No? Aw, shucks![N]
Who'll I play with now?[A][N]
Ever since everyone's gone off to war,[N]
it's been lonely around here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You know what I think?[N]
I think war is stupid![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry I said a bad word.[A][N]
Take this as an apology, and maybe[N]
come play with me later, please?[A][X]

##C3SamJosefTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aha! What is it, young lady?[N]
Are you quite alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never mind![N]
Never[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mind[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Did I come on too strong?[N]
Scare her off?[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sure she'll[N]
be back to talk. One day.[A][X]

##C3SamJosefRecruitment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aha! What is it, young lady?[N]
Are you quite alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never mind![N]
Never[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mind[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Did I come on too strong?[N]
Scare her off?[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sure she'll[N]
be back to talk. One day.[A][N]
In any case, I guess that means[N]
the others are here.[A][N]
Time to get to work.[A][X]

##C3Hint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga]
Remember the plan! Once the[N]
Dalstians open the door,[A][N]
that's when we send in[N]
the reinforcements![A][X]
