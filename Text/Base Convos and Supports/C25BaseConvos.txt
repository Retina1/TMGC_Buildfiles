Greetings, lassie! Glad to[N]
see you made it this far.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello there. What's this[N]
outfit supposed to be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No clue. Anna told me that someone[N]
would probably find it funny.[A][N]
But that's not what I'm here[N]
to discuss.[A] It's time for[N]
another patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's in a very fort-uitous[N]
location![A] Good luck gettin' to[N]
it without some help from a flier.[A][N]
Course, there's a lot of fortuitous[N]
places that you can't walk to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
So I guess you'll have to check[N]
them all![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's barely even a hint![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm truly amazed you've had[N]
any customers besides us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My girlie truly treads the road to ruin.[N]
Financial ruin, that is.[A][N]
But she always comes out ahead. So I[N]
gotta just trust her instincts.[A][N]
Anyhoot, I'll see ya! Good luck[N]
reclaiming your home, and all that![A][X]
