Ah, Emile. How goes your research?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well enough, I suppose.[A][N]
Nothing spectacularly game-changing[N]
or anything, but it's what it is.[A][N]
Sometimes, us academics have to make[N]
do with what we already know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, of course.[A][N]
I must say, though. This would be a great [N]
chance to dig into holy magics.[A][N]
For both of us, I mean.[A][N]
Obviously, as an elder scholar,[N]
light's a bit of a weakness of mine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] A fortuitous idea. Knowledge that serves[N]
us both in battle and for its own sake.[A][N]
On that note, I found some pages scattered[N]
about in that fort earlier.[A][N]
Presumably, someone was reading up,[N]
then attempted to discard their tome.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They did quite poorly. Only took a few[N]
hours to reconstruct the page order.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's your point, here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The tome contains a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unique power.[A][N]
Something unlike most other tomes[N]
I've seen.[A] And while most tomes contain[N]
the ancient script necessary to cast them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This contains legible text in[N]
the modern tongue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] remarkable![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Here, take it.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Catch.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[OpenQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Light, warm and heavy as pure gold[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][CloseQuote][N]
I've never seen anything like this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's yours now.[N]
I can't use it, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can't, either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whoops. Well, I'm sure you'll[N]
find it a happy owner soon enough.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay, then.[A][X]
