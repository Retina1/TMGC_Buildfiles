##ZekeArcPrimer
Welcome to the Zeke Chapters![A][N]
This short stretch of the game[N]
will focus on a smaller party.[A][N]
Don't worry: you'll unite with[N]
Blair and company soon enough.[A][N]
A few notes for Zeke's maps:[A][N]
-The convoy has been disabled.[A][N]
You'll be forced to discard items[N]
if you run out of inventory room.[A][N]
Make sure to use what you have![A][N]
Additionally, there are no shops[N]
and no chances to sell any items.[A][N]
Because of this, while your displayed[N]
gold total IS based on what Blair has,[A][N]
that won't end up mattering.[A][N]
-Until you've reunited with Blair,[N]
any unit death will be a game over.[A][N]
-For escape maps, Zeke doesn't have[N]
to be the last unit to escape.[A][N]
Good luck! I hope you've been[N]
enjoying the hack so far![A][X]
