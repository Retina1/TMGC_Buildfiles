Heya, Blair. Glad to[N]
see you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, Carbon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know there's been a lot[N]
happening lately.[A][N]
Anything you need from me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think I'm alright.[N]
Thanks, though.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I'm[N]
not much for Yg'stra.[A][N]
Maybe once the war's[N]
done, I'll travel some.[A][N]
How's Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I'd be more[N]
than a little biased.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Right. Guess I'll have[N]
to see it for myself.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'll have to tell me[N]
what you think, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ayup. I won't hold anything[N]
back, so you'd best be good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha! I'll try my best.[A][X]

Mister Emile! What'd you think[N]
of that lab we saw?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] much to ponder.[N]
It was terrifying.[A][N]
And yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was able[N]
to understand it.[A][N]
Not the why, of course.[N]
What could make man do that?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I could understand the[N]
finer details.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it bad?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's hard to say if knowledge[N]
itself is inherently evil.[A][N]
But I could tell that this is[N]
being used for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] fell aims.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Dark magic truly is a misnomer.[N]
Animas can also bring about ruin.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even so, all I can do is trust[N]
what I've dedicated my life to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're a good guy, mister.[N]
I trust what you do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad. It's just hard,[N]
knowing what I do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Knowing it can turn down[N]
a dark road like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If that happens, mister[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'll save you.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Like a hero.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Your friend there ever eat anyone?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You have ears. You heard me.[A][N]
That dragon of yours. He[N]
could easily eat a man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
No? Damn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's with you and[N]
excessive violence?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's amusing. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sounds a bit[N]
messed up to say, I guess.[A][N]
But there's a spectacle to it.[N]
Morals be damned.[A][N]
Don't worry, though. I don't[N]
take joy in US being flayed.[A][N]
That just makes more work for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad to hear.[A][N]
Most clerics I've known are[N]
a bit more[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] relaxed.[A][N]
But your work ethic's still[N]
something impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
First time anyone's told me[N]
that. So, thanks.[A][X]

##BlairKennethBPSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Disgraceful. I spend my life trying[N]
to prove elder magic's worth[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And now I'm met with this.[N]
A sloppy and hellish altar.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's truly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's more than something.[N]
It's a damning end.[A][N]
If the world hears of this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Hears that atrocities are being[N]
wreaked by elder scholars[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We'll, ironically enough, return[N]
to a dark age.[A][N]
People led by fear.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps so. But that makes you[N]
even more important.[A][N]
Showing the world that there's[N]
more to so-called [OpenQuote]dark magic.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] know. It still just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
hurts.[A] Knowing that all that[N]
could be washed away in an instant.[A][N]
All I've ever wanted is to learn.[N]
To know.[A] Elder magic is about[N]
that. Peering into the unknowable.[A][N]
Learning from what you think can't[N]
teach a thing.[A] It's reason, bent.[A][N]
Some think it's just a brute.[N]
A means to an end.[A][N]
As blunt a solution as a weapon.[N]
But it's a tool for humanity.[A][N]
And I won't stop until they understand.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Until he understands.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies for rambling, there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No harm done. You wish to be[N]
taken seriously.[A][N]
That's normal. That's what[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
we all wish for.[A][N]
And that's what you'll accomplish[N]
through your words and actions.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. That's what I've always[N]
done. And what I'll always do.[A][X]

##RachaelHyperiusBSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
At ease. What do you require?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad you did what[N]
you did.[A] Now knowing that[N]
the prince was near this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is discomforting to imagine what[N]
would've happened if he ended up here.[A][N]
Though, given the apparent intellect[N]
on display here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I'd imagine he[N]
would've become a hostage.[A][N]
One worth a literal king's ransom.[A][N]
You don't waste a source of funds[N]
on a one-time experiment.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In any case[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Though we can[N]
never be certain,[A][N]
it's possible your decisions[N]
saved the prince from this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And yet, those decisions bring[N]
him here now.[A] Curious.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It'll always be a hypothetical.[N]
And I don't care for those.[A][N]
I care for what actually happens.[N]
To my kingdom. To who I serve.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For certain, sir. Forget I[N]
ever brought this up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is alright. Harrowing thoughts[N]
are unavoidable.[A] We're lucky[N]
we have our truth to drown them.[A][X]

##ApolloAvanCPSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I must say, I do not[N]
like this place one bit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To think of such a forboding[N]
fort in such a vibrant land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
The contrast is striking.[A][N]
It's like my homeland[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
An oasis in an endless sea of sand.[A][N]
Except this building's the sea,[N]
and everything else is the oasis.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's one way to put it.[A][N]
Still, I'd rather this than[N]
Mevion.[A] There's no escape[N]
there.[A] It's all either swamps[N]
or dim streets.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
It's worth enduring a bit of dour[N]
for the promise of variety.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I agree. There's a comfort in[N]
what we know.[A] But there's a joy[N]
in discovery.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That there is. And I'd gladly[N]
take that risk to exapnd my world.[A][X]

I've seen them so many times.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Once in waking. Now in dreams.[A][N]
I'd thought I'd never see them[N]
in reality again.[A][N]
And you'd think I'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] happier.[A][N]
What's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wrong with me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're here now.[A][N]
Sir Desmond[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's time to act.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Of course.[A][N]
It's just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] overwhelming.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that's irrelevant.[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't need to[N]
be so hard on yourself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're taking this all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
far better than I'd expect.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] familiar with this feeling.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Feeling like you've thrown[N]
away good lives.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But it'd be betraying what they[N]
stood for if we wallow in despair.[A][N]
If their deaths don't hold meaning[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
it's our duty to give them meaning.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I guess so. Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] never be easy. It's hard[N]
for me to believe too.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've learned that we can't[N]
get caught up on the dead.[A][N]
After all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The rest of us[N]
are still alive.[A][N]
We've still got many who rely[N]
on the two of us.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe this isn't really[N]
helping.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see where you're coming[N]

Once we're back home, I'm retiring[N]
at the ripe old age of seventeen.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Actually, on that note[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What WERE you gonna do?[A][N]
In general, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never got a chance to really[N]
think about that.[A][N]
Knowing our country, I'd be doing[N]
military stuff for the rest of time.[A][N]
Doesn't appeal much to me, now.[A][N]
So I'm kinda glad this whole mess[N]
happened. Gives us another chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a way to look at it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Every last one of us has had[N]
our fill of fighting, I'm sure.[A][N]
I wanna enjoy life a bit.[N]
Do some wacky Carbon-y things.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
