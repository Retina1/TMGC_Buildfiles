##C22_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So it's confirmed.[N]
Dalst was behind this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That makes our choice easy.[N]
They're our enemy now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We should continue. I think[N]
I see something in the distance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. If the map's accurate,[N]
we're near Gohranos.[A][N]
Something of a new capital.[N]
I[...] haven't been there.[A][N]
But I've heard much of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'd[...] be smart to rest and[N]
resupply.[A] We need to prepare[N]
for any possibility.[A][X]


##C22_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's still remarkable. This place[N]
is beautiful.[A] And yet, so few[N]
people have resettled.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's what superstitions and[N]
a lacking government will do.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]It's still a home to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Are[...] you sure you wish to rule?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of[...] course.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Elba Cor[...] is my birthright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps so. But[...] You seem[N]
to resent that fact.[A][N]
Would ascending the throne[N]
truly make you happy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What does that matter?[N]
My land[...] needs a king.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Does it? We've seen how[N]
many lands have changed.[A][N]
Mevion, Holanis[...][A][N]
What says Elba Cor can't[N]
change, too?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's just a thought.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, do you wish to rule?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You got me there, I guess.[N]
I came this far for my title[...][A][N]
But with what we're about to do[...][N]
does that even mean anything?[A][N]
Or will it all have been for[N]
nothing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]The journey you had to[N]
prove yourself worthy[...][A][N]
That's hardly nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]I suppose so.[A][X]

##C22_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]More enemies?[N]
How in the hell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's[...] Mevion's colors.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What[...] are they doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This might've all been a trap.[N]
Mevion's full of mercenaries, right?[A][N]
[...]Maybe this force was hired to[N]
intercept us at Jraeyan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So Dalst knows what we're doing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Maybe. Or maybe they were a contingency[N]
for the Viridian Mercenaries.[A][N]
Either way[...] We have to[N]
take them out.[A][N]
We need to make it back to Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N]
[...]Everyone. It seems[...] the world's our[N]
enemy now. Be ready for anything.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Long time, no see, Peter.[N]
Have you joined up with us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Somethin' like that. I recognized[N]
that lady, so I talked it out with her.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Glad to hear, pal. You and I[N]
were a terror together.[A][N]
Gonna be fun to let loose[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadButch][OpenMidLeft]
Aw, crap.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Long time, no see, Peter.[N]
Are you with them?[A][N]
Is it time to duel to the death?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. I'm with them. [...]I don't[N]
look forward to this duel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Can't say I do, either.[N]
You're a force of nature.[A][N]
I know we've not seen each other[N]
much since the revolution,[A][N]
but I've heard stories.[A][N]
[...]Couldn't you just join us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I guess I could.[A][N]
This'll cost ya, though.[A][N]
How's a lifetime of free meals[N]
from Rutherford's place sound?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I could talk my brother into that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's settled, then. Good to[N]
fight with you again, bud.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Same here, pal.[A][X]

##C22PeterRecruit
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Pop quiz, lass. Do I know you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I feel I've seen you around[N]
long ago. In the capital.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Now that I think of it[...][N]
You're familiar.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, then. This is awkward.[N]
Someone's payrollin' your death.[A][N]
Sorry to tell ya like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I figured as much.[N]
Why tell me this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's drainin', killing friendly faces.[N]
But it's also draining not havin' money.[A][N]
[...]I'll cut you a deal.[A][N]
I'll join ya, and then once you're[N]
done fightin',[A] you'll give me[N]
a small fortune.[A][N]
Don't say you can't afford to.[N]
I know you're a noble.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. We could use[N]
someone with your skill.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. And, also[...] Never let[N]
it be heard what I did.[A][N]
Don't need this mercy taintin'[N]
my credibility.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Your secret's safe with me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. Time to rip and tear.[A][X]

You've got a bad feelin'?[A][N]
[...]Yeah. Not my ideal job.[N]
But, hey. It pays well.[A][N]

Don't like killin' a familiar face.[A][X]

[...]I'd say that was[...] a success.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Here's hoping he's still[N]
the mind to know where he stands.[A][N]
That he's not to meddle with our[N]
glorious state.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The terms of his exile were[N]
quite clear. Quite blunt.[A][N]
[...]You seem hesitant. Don't be.[N]
You're doing the right thing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It just saddens me, somewhat.[N]
To see a great man fall.[A][N]
[...]I'd better return to Arbordia.[A][N]
I believe I've got some manner[N]
of protege inbound.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. One of those academy[N]
up-and-comings.[A] I believe yours[N]
was chosen by that outreach lottery.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Correct. I've read all about him.[N]
I've seen his work. It's promising.[A][N]
[...]If nothing else, it's proof that[N]
the outreach funds are worth it.[A][N]
All Dalst deserves the chance to[N]
reach their potential.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's a chance he'd never otherwise have.[N]
And to think, I'll get to tell him.[A][N]

It's hardly anything now[...][N]
But I found this bow back there.[A][N]

Maybe if you hold it[...][N]
You'll come to an understanding.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Well, I'd say now's a good time[N]

It's the safest way to help[N]
someone out of a bind.[A][N]
Sure, Yoinks are a thing.[N]
