[...]What did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll keep this brief. You are[N]
a man of unlimited potential.[A][N]
And yet, you have made a mistake[N]
most untenable.[A] Still, I believe[N]
there is room for compromise.[A][N]
For you to grow from this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've written for you a modest proposal.[A][N]
If you take the deal and render us your[N]
assistance, you will be a free man.[A][N]
And it would simply be a shame for[N]
one like you to remain shackled.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Give me-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Some time to think on the matter?[N]
But of course.[A] The plan is one[N]
of a grand scale anyways.[A][N]
Just know that if you join us,[N]
you will be remembered.[A][N]
[...]As it stands, you are to be[N]
forgotten by history.[A][N]
A true pity of a fate.[A][N]
Now. Feel free to take your leave.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][Event][OpenMidRight]
[...]This criminal may be nothing.[N]
Or he may be everything.[A][N]
But with our future at stake,[N]
every card must be played.[A][N]
[...]And on that note, I believe[N]
it's time for him to pay his dues.[A][N]
Surely, he will understand that he[N]
brought everything unto himself.[A][X]

##Prologue_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]Whew[...] It's been some time.[N]
I forgot how far Arbordia truly was.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I mean[...] Are you really surprised?[A][N]
You live at the extreme tip of Dalst.[N]
The capital would naturally be more central.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I suppose. Still. I could swear[N]
it was a far shorter trip.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, back then, you WERE a child.[N]
Didn't ever really take this by foot.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I get it.[N]
You can stop now.[A][N]
[...]What's that over there?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If I had to wager a guess,[N]
either bandits or rebels.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Rebels? Here?[N]
Why?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
[...]I swear, you're clueless.[A][N]
To put it simply, the populace is[N]
uneasy about recent negotiations-[A][N]
between Dalst and Yg'stra.[A][N]
There's a popular belief that the[N]
Yg'strans have been gearing for war,[A][N]
and that Dalst's attempts at an alliance[N]
will just lead Dalst into conflict.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N]
In any case, we should probably quell this.[A][N]
I fear these rebels may harm the[N]
civilian populace,[A] and I'm sure[N]
the higher-ups will understand.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
That's a bold move, but if[N]
you're confident,[A] I'm with[N]
you all the way.[A][N]
Just be careful.[A][N]
It'd be quite the shame for[N]
us to perish so quickly.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But of course![A][N]
Together, I have no doubts[N]
that we'll prevail![A][X]

##Prologue_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadKenneth]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that it? Have we won?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I believe[...] we have.[A][N]
The people living here[N]
need fear no longer.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
What happened, anyway?[A][N]
It was pure happenstance that I[N]
was wandering this road-[A][N]
and I see the two of you in[N]
a life-or-death struggle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
We were headed towards the capital,[N]
when we saw rebels stirring chaos.[A][N]
It would have been irresponsible[N]
of us to ignore them![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
[...]Did the thought cross your mind that[N]
brazenly entering a skirmish-[A][N]
especially when, as far as I know,[N]
you've never seen real combat-[A][N]
would be more irresponsible?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sounds like you were concerned for us.[N]
How sweet of you, Kenneth![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
That's[...] I[...][N]
Bah, forget it.[A][N]
What called you to the capital?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Presumably, it's related to the[N]
legitimacy of Aercolyn.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I see[...] Very well.[A][N]
If you two are to continue on this[N]
journey, I shall follow you.[A][N]
Clearly, without my levelheadedness,[N]
you'll be digging early graves.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then![A][N]
I guess you can call that payback for[N]
all the times I bailed you out,[A][N]
back at the academy.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
[...]I had hoped we came to a mutual[N]
agreement never to speak of that again.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Enough, you two. The capital's not[N]
much further away.[A][N]
Let us depart.[A][X]

##Prologue_Ending_Dead_Kenneth
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Is that it? Have[...] we won?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I believe[...] we have.[A][N]
The people living here[N]
need fear[...] no longer.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sorry[...] Kenneth[...][N]
This is[...] my fault[...][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Blair[...] It is[...] regrettable[N]
what happened today.[A][N]
But you must not blame[N]
yourself.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But that[...] that's just not true![A][N]
I'm the one who chose[...][N]
who chose to fight![A][N]
I dragged him into this[...][N]
And now he's dead![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Let us proceed.[N]
It's our duty to carry on for him.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][X]

##PKennethText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth]
[...]What do we have here?[N]
Wait[...] is that Blair?[A][N]
What's she doing here?[A][N]
[...]And who's that guy seconds[N]
away from axing her?[A][N]
Wait[...] That's unimportant.[A][N]
I should help her- if not for her,[N]
then for my honor as Kenneth,[A][N]
heir to the territory Neillstrom-[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Yes, lovely to see you, Kenneth.[A][N]
Now stop monologuing and[N]
start fighting.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]My bad.[A][X]

##PNVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent]
[...]Whoever lives here must[N]
have already evacuated.[A][N]
[...]What's this note?[A][N]
[OpenQuote]If any heroes see this, please,[N]
take this relic and save our town![CloseQuote][A][N]
[...]It'd be wrong NOT to[N]
take this, right?[A][X]

##PSVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Are you with Dalst? [...]Yes?[N]
Oh, thank the heavens![A][N]
These rebels have been performing[N]
vile acts to draw your attention.[A][N]
At this point, I don't even care[N]
what their cause is anymore-[A][N]
I just want to know that I'll[N]
live to see tomorrow.[A][N]
Please, take this, and use it[N]
to save our village![A][X]

##PDavelarnBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavelarn]
Hey! We're Dalstian too![N]
Why are you fighting us?[A][N]
What's so wrong with protest?[N]
So what if civilians die?[A][N]
Better them over us,[N]
I say![A][X]

##PDavelarnDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavelarn]
Urgh! You[...] scum[...][A][N]
Signing us[...] away[...][N]
to[...] Yg'stra[...][A][N]
Well[...] This isn't[...][N]
the end[...] for you[...][A][N]
Killing us[...] won't make[...][N]
this[...] go[...][A][X]

##PBlairBattle

[...]The enemy before me[...][N]
I mustn't falter now[...][A][N]
The energy within me[...][N]
The primal magical essence[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
Shall deliver us to[N]
a glorious future![A][X]

##PBlairKennethTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I'm glad to see you, Kenneth.[N]
What brings you by, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was merely headed north to conduct[N]
some business for my father.[A][N]
Quite the coincidence that you'd[N]
end up entangled in a skirmish.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, in any case, you're[N]
a real great help.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm the son of the nation's greatest[N]
military commander.[A] While I may not[N]
be precisely following in his path,[A][N]
I've still got more than enough skill.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see those skills in action, then.[A][X]
