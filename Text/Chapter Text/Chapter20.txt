##Arc2Ending
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The mysteries of Holanis's fall[N]
have all been laid bare.[A][N]
Before Blair and Zeke awaits[N]
an uncertain future,[A][N]
against a foe with untold amounts[N]
of power at their disposal.[A][N]
To even the odds, they seek[N]
the assistance of mercenaries.[A][N]
Even so, will they prove a match[N]
for the shadows entangling Ulmaron?[A][N]
Only time can tell.[A][N]
But before that, yet another[N]
story must be told.[A][N]
A story of the selfless.[A][N]
A story of brave souls diving headfirst[N]
into fate. The story... of Viridian.[A][X]

##BrandlLetter
My son... I hope this letter[N]
finds you well.[A] It brings[N]
me great sorrow,[A] knowing how[N]
short our time was cut.[A][N]
And yet, I knew I must let you[N]
off to settle your doubts.[A][N]
In the chaos, I forgot to present[N]
you what I had for so long cherised.[A][N]
It is a humble charm your mother[N]
had given me when we were wed.[A][N]
Your mother passed shortly after[N]
your birth, as you may recall.[A][N]
She was a noble and resolute warrior.[N]
And she'd... be proud of you.[A][N]
Proud as I am.[A][N]
Wear this charm, and remember who[N]
you are.[A] You are the future[N]
of our great Elba Cor.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. Nothing left to it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveRight] open.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it?[A][N][OpenRight]
There's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nothing here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing? Was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it a lie?[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
I doubt so. And, considering everything[N]
we've seen thus far[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's terrifying.[A] And it's obvious.[A][N]
We weren't the first ones here.[A][N]
Someone from Holanis must've[N]
taken the gift.[A][N]
And, considering what we've seen[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
The river excavation, the dragons[N]
at the Archives[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are they intent on[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
repeating history?[A][N][OpenRight]
Or ignoring it, perhaps.[A][N]
Either way, this confirms our worst[N]
fears.[A] And we don't know how long[N]
they've had this power.[A][N]
Or if they've refined it.[A][N]
But it still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] doesn't make sense.[A][N]
If the new capital[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If Gohranos[N]
were behind the new dragons[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Some other nation would've had[N]
to have stepped in by now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Do you think Holanis is[N]
a puppet in all of this?[A][N][OpenRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know. In any case,[N]
none of this sits well.[A][N]
But we should plan our course[N]
of action very carefully.[A][N]
Come. Let us return to the[N]
village outside.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Didn't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] he mention doing[N]
research in Holanis?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] could this mean?[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So that leaves Fort Jraeyan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But with what we know, mightn't[N]
it be too risky a move now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Even before today, I'll admit.[A][N]
I was hesitant about the prospect of[N]
seizing such a stronghold.[A][N]
Knowing that Holanis holds this[N]
power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] doesn't make it easier.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadMessenger]
Pardon me![A][N][MoveFarLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenMidRight]
That garb[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're from Elba Cor![N]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] my father alright?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
The king is well. He wished for[N]
me to deliver a message,[A][N]
as well as a few objects.[A][N]
He apologizes for not being[N]
of adequate assistance.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hardly. Him doing this is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
more than enough for me.[A][N]
Let's see, here. A tome.[N]
For you, Blair, I'd presume.[A][N]
A pair of lances.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
In your right hand is the Stalwart.[N]
A lance of unmoving conviction.[A][N]
And in your left is the kingdom's[N]
most prized treasure.[A][N]
The Nuiusseon. One of the finest[N]
weapons on the continent,[A][N]
and material proof of the first[N]
king's will.[A][N]
As for the tome, I know little of it.[A][N]
But I believe someone named Elcorian[N]
sent it for you, milady.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He left a note in the cover.[N]
This spell[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's named Waning.[A][N]
He says it draws from my[N]
determination.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He's too kind.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
The king also sent this.[A][N]
A keepsake, and proof of[N]
your bloodline.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe his letter may[N]
explain its significance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you. Tell Father I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
well. And that I'll be alright.[A][N]
I'll read his letter tonight.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. Is there anything[N]
else you'd like me to tell him?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. I've an idea.[N]
If it's not too much trouble[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
For His Highness, I shall do[N]
all that I can.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Can you take this pamphlet[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And contact this mercenary?[A][N]
I believe they were in Couria[N]
fairly recently.[A][N]
The pamphlet should have further[N]
information.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I see. What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] would you like me[N]
to tell them?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hadn't thought that[N]
far ahead.[A] Give[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] me a moment.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. I shall only[N]
depart on your leave.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
What'd you give her?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The means to contact a mercenary[N]
group I met in Couria.[A][N]
If we're taking on such a[N]
dangerous threat,[A][N]
we need all the help we[N]
can possibly muster.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sure Father will[N]
spare no expense.[A][N]
Very well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Here, help me write[N]
this request.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd imagine it'd be[N]
some time before they respond.[A][N]
What's our plan for that time?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not dwell on that.[A][N]
Worst case, we just stay at this[N]
village for a few more weeks.[A][N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] probably safer than[N]
rushing to our deaths.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. I trust you.[N]
Let's hope these mercs impress.[A][N][OpenLeft]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] will. I'm sure of it.[N]
Anyway, we've work to do.[A][N]
And our messenger is waiting.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, then. Grab a quill.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah, Girard. I was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] digging around,[N]
and I found some of your old notes.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
So you have. Forget that rubbish.[N]
'Twas but a fleeting dream.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
That's what I had thought, but the[N]
concept had stuck with me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And I had to refine it.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have a look.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You solved the problem?[N]
This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is amazing![A][N]
To think we can go beyond mere Simulacrums[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Creating genuine life from the departed![A][N]
This will change the world. I'm certain.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not without its flaws.[N]
But it's a start.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
You undersell yourself, friend. With this,[N]
our glorious future is finally within reach![A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] honor me, Girard. Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you[N]
quite sure this is right, though?[A][N]
There's some not quite noble implications[N]
to this whole[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] procedure.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
That there may be, but all shall be[N]
worth it. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'll see.[A][N]
And your name may perhaps go down[N]
in history.[A] The man who brought[N]
salvation unto mankind.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elcorian.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, Girard.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArbordia][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
This'll all be worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In any case, I must be off.[N]
There is much to be done.[A][X]
