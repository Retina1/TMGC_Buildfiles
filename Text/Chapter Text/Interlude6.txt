a hard time sleeping now.[A][N]
You'd think I'd be all over this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's what it is, I guess.[A][N]
How about you? Are you holding[N]

What are you apologizing for?[N]
I chose to follow you.[A][N]
And so far, I'd say it has[N]
been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is there anything in[N]
all of this for you?[A][N]
Are you risking yourself[N]
for nothing but my sake?[A][N][CloseEyes]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hardly feels fair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I could say the same of you.[N]
What do you stand to gain?[A][N]
Besides some vague approval from[N]
Dalst, I doubt much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair enough. But even that[N]
has some manner of value.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I just don't want you overdoing it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nae, it be all good. I'll be[N]

You don't wanna talk about[N]

A sword! I've been reading some[N]

It seems a bit[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] large.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

My apologies, milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's alright, Apollo. I presume[N]
you were praying?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Something like that. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Asking for protection.[A][N]

##I6FlynnConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadFlynn][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must say, you're beyond most[N]
other swordsmen I've seen.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have you ever heard of[N]
the Myrmidons?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that not just the common name[N]
of swift sword users?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's an interesting bit of history.[A][N]
You see, there was an ancient order of[N]
swordsmen with roots in Opistia.[A][N]
Their power was beyond anyone alive today.[A][N]
There's much debate over the source[N]
of their immense ability.[A][N]
Some say their skills were mere talent,[N]
others a gift from Opistus,[A][N]
and others still who believe it to[N]
be an effect of some grand magic.[A][N]
Have you noticed that some swordsmen[N]
we've fought are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] attuned?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To magic? I believe I've seen[N]
something like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Myrmidons are extremely resilient[N]
towards all manners of magic.[A][N]
In any case, no matter their origins,[N]
one thing appears clear.[A][N]
The power of the Myrmidons is passed[N]
down by blood.[A] Not all inherit it,[N]
but those who do shine with potential.[A][N]
The Myrmidons have since spread and[N]
settled down all throughout the land.[A][N]
While they're rare, they can come from[N]
any nation on Ulmaron.[A][N]
Some may train for their entire lives[N]
to match the innate skill of a Myrmidon,[A][N]
but one cannot replace the attunement[N]
to the arcane with sheer force of will.[A][N]
At least, not that I know of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]From this, I'd presume you're[N]
a descendant of a Myrmidon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hardly a big deal.[N]
Really. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now I feel awkward.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry for rambling there.[A][X]

##I6DesmondConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, milady. Are you well?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd say so. What of you, Desmond?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've been fine. Certainly wouldn't have[N]
expected this several months back.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder if it'll ever be[N]
the same as it was.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hadn't even considered[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What'll become[N]
of Aercolyn without an army?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't know. It's been so long[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I myself have failed to realize.[A][N]
It's just me and some lucky stragglers.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'll have to make do, I guess.[A][N]
I doubt Dalst would charitably bolster[N]
our numbers.[A] And the state's not got[N]
the funding for a mercenary army.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This expedition'll keep that out of[N]
our minds a while longer[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But eventually, we'll have to face[N]
reality.[A][CloseEyes] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Face my failures.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]None of this was your doing.[N]
You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] done well, Desmond.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

It's quite rare for you[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? I'm not talking to you.[N]
I'm talking to this little guy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that a lizard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He's just a little guy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He's certainly cute.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is surprising.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You caught me red-handed. No point[N]
trying to hide it now.[A][N]
Is a monster like me allowed to[N]
take pleasure in critters?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
O-of course![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good. Now, if you'll excuse me.[N]
Beryl needs some sustenance.[A][N]
Gonna go find him some bugs.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]

##I6ButchConvo

How're you doing, Butch?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well as one can be, I suppose.[N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mighty strange.[A][N]
We're in a desolate wasteland[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And yet I'm enjoying it.[A][N]
Is this what purpose feels like?[N]
Haven't felt this in a while.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You fought in the Revolution,[N]
correct? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is it like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Suppose it is, in a sense.[A][N]
It's a different purpose, but it's[N]
a purpose nonetheless.[A][N]
Definitely beats whatever I was[N]
doing for Mevion before.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder. My country's a messed[N]
up place, really.[A][N]
Brigandry, hostility, a general[N]
sense of isolation[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've grown[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] used to it.[N]
And now I wish I wasn't.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, the country changed once.[N]
What says it can't again?[A][N]
Maybe not through a bloody[N]
revolution, perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I get ya, young lady.[N]

##I6RachaelConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Rachael. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry about[N]
keeping you from Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly an issue. My prince is[N]
here, and I shall protect him.[A][N]
The king would wish it so. And I'm[N]
sure he'll be quite alright.[A][N]
The Elba Cor army is quite sizable,[N]
and quite resilient.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose so. Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Do you miss your home?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's an appeal to simplicity,[N]
in simply serving Couria in peace.[A][N]
But times of strife are what we must[N]
all be prepared for.[A] I shall not[N]
falter in my duty, is all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate that. You've been[N]
one of our most reliable allies.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There we go![A][N]
Have a look at her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite the fire.[N]
Very big.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd stand back.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What're you talking about?[N]
I must revel in my fire![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just saying.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Oh, dear.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

##I6MikeyConvo

Good evening, Mikey.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you need me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not particularly. Just checking in.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you miss Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hard to answer. I don't[N]
miss fighting a senseless war.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] There's good people there.[N]
Like my sister.[A][N]
Have I mentioned her? She's something[N]
of a big deal among the army.[A][N]
I doubt you've heard the name Joan,[N]
but if you have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's[N]
quite impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Between the war and this journey, it's[N]
been some time since I've seen her.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Last I remember, she's seeing another woman[N]
in the army.[A] Again, I know the name[N]
means nothing to you,[A] but there's this[N]
legendary halberdier named Sonia.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hopefully they're handling current[N]
events in Yg'stra well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies for that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly your fault. It was[N]
either you or Yg'stra.[A][X]

##I6AthenaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
Young lady. I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a request.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing, Athena.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] talked to someone in[N]
the army, a while back.[A][N]
And they made me realize[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My wyvern is without a name.[A][N]
I've been trying to think of one,[N]
but I've unfortunately come up short.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, let me[N]
get a look at[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Him, I believe. If we're judging[N]
by the scale patterns.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's a good name for a[N]
helpful big guy like you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N]
How about[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Perseus?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's a bit much, but sure.[N]
How do you feel about it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think he likes it. I'm surprised[N]
he went unnamed for so long.[A][N]
In Dalst, almost everyone names[N]
their mount immediately.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a common enough practice in Opistia.[A][N]
I guess I never felt the need. A rider and[N]
wyvern have something of an unspoken bond.[A][N]
Quantifying it with a name felt excess.[N]
But if he enjoys having a name, so be it.[A][X]

##I6CharleyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Evening, milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, Charley.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've been around a lot, right?[N]
Have you been to Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As a matter of fact, I have not.[A][N]
They tend not to host tournaments in[N]
barren and lifeless lands.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's funny to think about.[N]
I've been beyond the seas[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Lands most of us from Ulmaron would[N]
never dream of seeing in our life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I've yet to see all there[N]
is back here.[A][N]
Have you ever thought of travel?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not particularly. Before this conflict,[N]
I'd hardly ever even left Dalst.[A][N]
And once Aercolyn is restored[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I can't imagine that changing.[A][N]
Then again, I've allies in Elba Cor[N]
and Opistia now. So who knows?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just something to think about.[A][N]
If you ever feel the world's too small,[N]
there's surely a new horizon to explore.[A][X]

You're one of us now, Hollandaise.[N]
That's all there is to it.[A][N]
Do you think we'd toy with you[N]
just because you were a bandit?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's what I'd do. But[N]
I guess I see your point.[A][N]

Greetings, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Sir Hyperius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for the sir. You're leading me.[N]
But, I feel like I say this a lot.[A][N]
I am but a humble public servant.[N]
A title is of little concern to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But you've done[N]
enough to earn that title.[A][N]
You deserve the honor that[N]
comes with it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. On an unrelated note,[N]
what do you think of His Highness?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Prince Zeke? He's a reliable ally.[N]
I'm glad to have him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A respectable opinion.[A][N]
I can tell he's pleased to have[N]
a companion of his age.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it? You[N]
trailed off a bit.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nothing of import.[N]
I'm just reflecting.[A][N]
Keep yourself well, young lady.[A][X]

##I6JosefConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Evening, milady! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well. What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been quite great! It's always[N]
a pleasure to ward off scum.[A][N]
Their riches shall serve a grander[N]
purpose, of keeping us supplied.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't it a little ironic[N]
to steal from bandits?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose you're not wrong.[A][N]
But gold does nothing for a corpse,[N]
and everything for a living man.[A][N]
And unfortunately, it's somewhat[N]
impractical to return this gold.[A][N]
No real way to find its [OpenQuote]rightful[N]
owner[CloseQuote] anymore.[A] So the next best[N]
thing is us using it,[A][N]
as to invest in our army and[N]
keep more people protected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough. You seem to[N]
have this all figured out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hate wasting anything. Time,[N]
resources, lives[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm driven to get the most out[N]
of everything I can.[A][X]

##I6JosefSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Evening, milady! I have[N]
something to ask of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Josef?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've just been thinking about[N]
that kid[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hilbert.[A][N]
He's a sweet young man, and[N]
I think he looks up to me.[A][N]
I want to keep him safe,[N]
but I'm not sure what more to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He's an anima mage[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
So he'd struggle against elder magic.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Opistinian magic's good against[N]
that, right?[A] I think I have[N]
an idea.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sure you[N]
could ask someone to-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Teach me light magic! You're[N]
truly something, milady.[A][N]
I'm sure he'd be glad to[N]
hear of this.[A][N]
I'll go find someone. On behalf[N]
of both me and Hilbert, I thank you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was going to say a light[N]
mage could fight alongside you.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though, an armored knight using[N]
magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That could be interesting.[A][X]

Again, I must thank you, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am just fulfilling His vision.[N]
No need to thank me, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So, Opistus guided you to us?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thank you, Opistus.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The road ahead is a harsh one,[N]
and He wishes to guide us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I must say, though. How'd[N]
you catch up with us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course. One of Opistinia's[N]
wyvern guards deliverred me unto you.[A][N]
I would've taken Wendell, but he's[N]
been under the weather as of late.[A][N]
Once he's feeling better, perhaps[N]
he can be of assistance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wendell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My beloved wyvern, Wendell.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I didn't think of you as[N]
the type to have a wyvern.[A][N]

Understandable. I've been well.[N]
Stopping here was a great move.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I'm sure we'll[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm curious. How does it[N]
feel, returning to Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must admit, it's not quite[N]
what I expected I'd be doing.[A][N]
Though do remember that we're[N]
in western Holanis,[A] and I[N]
lived more in the east.[A][N]
So it's bound to feel different.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. True.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'll be interesting seeing[N]
more of the country, at least.[A][N]
Though it stings a bit not getting[N]
a chance to see my home longer.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You don't have to feel bad. It's[N]
my choice to be here,[A] and I know[N]
I'd be unsatisfied staying behind.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I still wonder.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think your concern over[N]
this is proof enough.[A][N]
That you'd be a worthy prince.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

It's instinctual, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Fair enough. If you change your[N]

I've nothing else going on.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Might've already hunted us enough[N]

##I6ArtemisConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
Greetings, young lady. I had been[N]
meaning to ask you something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You knew I was from Holanis, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] correct. I guess we could've[N]
saved some trouble by asking you things.[A][N]
Like where the army we fought came from.[A][N]
Apologies. It's been a hectic string of[N]
events, and I overlooked that option.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can appreciate being busy. Besides,[N]
as it happens, I wouldn't be much help.[A][N]
The closest thing to an army Holanis[N]
should have is in Gohranos,[A] and it's[N]
hardly enough to support an invasion.[A][N]
Many of those at the archives were[N]
mercenary in nature.[A] Technically, you[N]
could argue all Gohranians are mercenary,[A][N]
but in this case, most of those at the[N]
archives were not familiar to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What does that mean? Is someone[N]
funding these mercenaries?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If only I knew. Gohranos should hardly[N]
have the coin for this kind of manpower.[A][N]
Perhaps there's another faction behind[N]
the scenes, setting this all up.[A][N]
But I've seen nothing of that in[N]
Gohranos.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can probably just continue[N]
our route as planned.[A][N]
The landmarks that're recorded[N]
in the Archives.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd agree. Of the three, I've only ever been to[N]
the Aqueduct, and only in passing.[A][N]
Can't say anything for sure of[N]
what actually happens there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, Artemis.[N]
This helped a lot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time. I'd rather not fight for[N]
a Holanis borne of the shadows.[A][X]

##I6ToddsworthConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, milady. Perfect timing![N]
I had the grandest of ideas![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it, Toddsworth?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To bolster army morale, I thought[N]
perhaps I could regale us with a song.[A][N]
A perfect ballad came to me in a vision![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What kind of vision?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, I found some absolutely[N]
delectable berries,[A] and when I[N]
ate them,[A] the gods themselves came[N]
unto me.[A] They called me their most[N]
turpid vessel,[A] and spoke to me a[N]
song beyond mortal ken.[A][N]
And then, I woke up and found a stream[N]
of blood coming from my ears.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're fine now.[A][N]
Anyway, shall I?[A][X]
##YouMadeThisChoiceNowLiveWithIt

[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Lady Blair! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm alright, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! A quick question,[N]
if you'll be so kind.[A][N]
I've been meaning to get[N]
in some sparring.[A][N]
Specifically, some practice[N]
against other swordsmen.[A][N]
I'm wondering if there's anyone[N]
in particular you wish me spar.[A][N]
I'd imagine I'll grow differently[N]
based on my opponent, after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd trust your judgement,[N]
but if you insist,[A][N]
I can pick for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, milady. Pick whoever[N]
you feel would suit me best.[A][X]

##I6StefanArinConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]

Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadButch][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]

Let's see if you can impress.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, sir! I'll show[N]

Then have at it![A][X]

##I6StefanJeffConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Jeff?[A][N]
I'm sure you could learn something[N]
from his evasive style.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadJeff][OpenMidLeft]
Well met-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, kid. I don't do sparring.[N]
But I suppose I can show you something.[A][N]
See this, here? It's a lockpick.[A][N]
In 20 minutes, it'll be a[N]
golden key for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A key to success![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, just a key to some[N]
sucker's prized riches.[A][X]

##I6StefanFlynnConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Flynn?[N]
I think he'd enjoy it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadFlynn][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]

##I6StefanHyperiusConvo

He's an absolute powerhouse.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You wish for a challenge?[N]
This takes me back to my youth[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Know that I won't go easy[N]
on you, young one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate that, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

blade's resolve![A][X]

##I6StefanLeilaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Leila?[A][N]
She's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unconventional, for sure.[N]
But I'm sure you can learn from her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadLeila][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]

Don't be shy! I've seen[N]
your skill, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's great.[A][X]

##I6StefanSoloConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't think there's[N]
anyone left to spar with.[A][N]
Arin's in no shape to fight,[N]
and everyone else is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Ah. My apologies. I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] tie[N]
a sword to a training dummy.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, nothing for it, I guess.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Hyah! Hah![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's this unfamiliar feeling?[N]
Is this some blessing?[A][N][CloseEyes]
Whatever it is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I feel empowered.[N]

##I6EmileConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Ah, Blair. Good to see you.[N]
I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]
I felt since we had time, I should[N]
make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]
devoted the basics of Opistinian magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
but I find it relaxing.[A][N]
I'll do whatever you think best.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoAnima
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd stick with what you're[N]
best at, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anima magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
On that note[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I think I have a strong tome somewhere.[N]
That'll be good for practice.[A][N]
Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoLight
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Light magic sounds like[N]
it could be helpful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Light magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
It'll cover anima's weakness nicely.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoDark
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know it's not your favorite,[N]
but dark magic may help us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dark magic? Understandable.[N]
It's always good to push oneself.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoStaves

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAvan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
You know, when you're not constantly[N]
being attacked by bandits,[A][N]
the Lowlands are surprisingly nice.[A][N]
There's a beauty within the ashes.[N]
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad to be away from Mevion.[N]
It's nice, of course.[A][N]

If you're interested.[A][N]

Can't do one damned thing without[N]
getting soot in every orifice.[A][N]
Least there's no shortage of[N]
goons to give a bonk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nobody would fault you if you[N]
returned to your tent.[A][N]
Feel free to take respite from[N]
the ash.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nah. It's fine. Besides, it's[N]
a rather remarkable view here.[A][N]
The moonlight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How it reflects off[N]
the ashen dusts[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's nice.[A][N][CloseEyes]

Well, yes it is! Your blonde friend[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Natasia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] She taught me a thing or two.[A][N]
Turns out swinging an axe is some[N]
good stress relief![A][N]
Plus, we need the firewood anyway.[N]
It's pretty swell all around.[A][N]
Maybe I'll teach her the basics[N]
of staffing sometime.[A][N]
I told her I wouldn't teach her[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I could learn to teach.[A][N]
Probably.[A] Anyway, keep well,[N]

certainly helped me out.[A][N]
I think we all needed a break.[A][N]
And even though it's hardly luxury,[N]
there's a certain[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quaintness.[A][N]
I'm not sure how much longer we[N]

back on track soon.[A][N]
Before then, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I should catch[N]

I believe we're all well-rested.[N]
Shall we break camp on the morrow?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That sounds fine to me.[N]
From here, we're near the Aqueduct.[A][N]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] has done us well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Agreed. I just hope we find what we seek.[N]
If we were completely off-base[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
Who knows what could've happened to[N]

I'm sure even if we're wrong,[N]
they'd remain standing.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. If my father could hold[N]
Elba Cor together against Yg'stra,[A][N]
he can surely hold it together against[N]
the Holanians.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And I can say the same of Lord Neillstrom.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that's all if we're wrong.[N]
And I don't think we were.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
