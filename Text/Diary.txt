## PrologueDiary
Well, it's been quite some time[N]
since I wrote in this thing![N]
Since I've little better to[N]
do on the road to Arbordia,[N]
why not chronicle my thoughts?[N]
[N]
It's been a few months since[N]
my graduation from the[N]
Northern Arbordian academy,[N]
and I thought it'd be quite[N]
some time before my return[N]
to the capital. Imagine my[N]
surprise at an urgent[N]
notice from Sir Elcorian![N]
Perhaps the relegitimization[N]
of Aercolyn is nigh?[N]
[N]
Accompanying me on this road is[N]
Arin, my close friend.[N]
We both went to the academy[N]
together, and have known each[N]
other longer than I remember.[N]
...Not sure why she felt the need[N]
to come, but how can I say no?[N]
[N]
We should arrive within a few[N]
day's travel, now. Maybe I'll[N]
finally be able to prove myself,[N]
and escape the shadow of my[N]
father's deeds...[X]

## Chapt1Diary
After fighting off some rebels,[N]
we met with Sir Elcorian.[N]
The road of relegitimization[N]
will be long and challenging,[N]
but I'm sure all will end well.[N]
[N]
As my first task (I suppose[N]
to prove loyalty?), we've[N]
been sent near the Mevion[N]
border, as there have been[N]
reports of conflict.[N]
From what I understand,[N]
Mevion takes quite an[N]
aggressive approach to[N]
their [OpenQuote]neutrality,[CloseQuote] so[N]
we need to be ready[N]
for anything.[N]
[N]
According to my map, this[N]
all appears to be happening[N]
quite close to a village[N]
a dear friend lives in.[N]
Hopefully she's faring well-[N]
it'd be lovely to see[N]
her again.[X]

## Chapt2Diary
Not much time to write.[N]
Yg'stra's invading, despite[N]
recent negotiations.[N]
[N]
We're the only ones who can[N]
make any kind of meaningful[N]
impact now, which is[N]
honestly a little terrifying.[N]
[N]
No matter what, we won't[N]
give up. I can't lose[N]
everything again.[X]

## Chapt3Diary
Things didn't exactly...[N]
go great. Aercolyn's army[N]
has seemingly disappeared[N]
without a trace.[N]
[N]
I'm now leading a small[N]
force into Yg'stra to[N]
try and seek answers.[N]
...I don't know why this[N]
has to happen to me,[N]
now of all times.[N]
[N]
...It'll all work out fine.[N]
It has to.[X]

## Chapt4Diary
There's not much time.[N]
We have to keep running.[N]
I don't even know where[N]
we're going anymore.[N]
[N]
If this is the end, I'm[N]
sorry for dragging you[N]
all into this.[X]

## Chapt5Diary
Thanks to Peggy, we're[N]
nearing Mevion's swamps[N]
now. I doubt we'll find[N]
ourselves welcome, but[N]
we've hardly any other[N]
options.[N]
[N]
Still, I somehow feel[N]
hopeful after everything.[X]

## Chapt6Diary
The king of Elba Cor wishes[N]
to meet with me. It feels[N]
quite reassuring, knowing[N]
I've an ally somewhere.[N]
[N]
Speaking of allies, I[N]
wonder how Dalst fares...[N]
Even all their magic may[N]
fold to Yg'stra's sheer might.[N]
[N]
...For now, I ought to focus[N]
on myself, and on my mission.[N]
The road to Elba Cor will[N]
surely not be an easy one.[X]

## Chapt7Diary
We're finally nearing Elba Cor.[N]
I've learned more about the[N]
king, and about the tragedies[N]
the kingdom has endured.[N]
[N]
Moreso than ever, I know[N]
I have to see this through.[N]
I have to know what the[N]
king sees in me.[N]
[N]
On a brighter note,[N]
I believe Emile said he'd[N]
spend some time in Elba Cor[N]
for field research. That'd[N]
be something, running into him![X]

## Chapt8Diary
We're off to Loile to help[N]
Captain Cid settle some[N]
business, or something.[N]
I'm not quite sure on the[N]
details, but it's what we[N]
have to do for his aid.[N][N]
Supposedly, the volcano's[N]
due to start spewing ash soon.[N]
I guess I should be glad we're[N]
getting this done now.[N][N]
I'm still just thinking about[N]
how the king's made friends[N]
with a pirate king. That's[N]
something you'd only hear about[N]
in myths, yet here we are![X]

## Chapt9Diary
We just left Moneubris, and[N]
I'm... not sure how I feel about[N]
sea travel. I think I like it?[N]
It beats walking, I guess.[N][N]
Opistia... Hopefully, they'll[N]
be the key to resolving this war.[N]
If not, maybe we could sail all[N]
the way around the continent[N]
back to Dalst? ...That sounds[N]
absurd, I know.[N][N]
Whoops! Almost dropped this[N]
thing overboard. That'd be[N]
a tragedy. Guess that's my[N]
signal to stop.[X]

## Chapt10Diary
We've been joined by some[N]
Opistians. Surprisingly, the[N]
boat doesn't feel too much[N]
more crowded than before.[N][N]
Let us hope the rest of our[N]
trip is uneventful. I could[N]
do for a few days without[N]
a pirate raid. At least[N]
it's not the Yg'stran army.[X]

## Chapt11Diary
(The page has been[N]
left entirely blank.)[X]

## Chapt12Diary
...It's been a bit since I[N]
wrote in this. We... made[N]
it to Opistia. Got tangled[N]
up in a skirmish ashore.[N]
And now we've procured aid[N]
from the Opistinians.[N][N]
The Archbishop's suggest we[N]
partake in some kind of trial,[N]
and I see no reason to deny him.[N]
Apparently, it's traditional.[N][N]
...Nothing much left to say.[X]

## Chapt13Diary
Thanks to Opistia, we've the[N]
resources to invade Yg'stra.[N]
Hopefully, a decisive attack[N]
will end the war swiftly.[N]
Meanwhile, Opistia shall deploy[N]
to Elba Cor and ensure their[N]
continued survival.[N][N]
It feels... strange, being the[N]
one to lead the charge like this.[N]
Surely someone like[N]
the archbishop would be[N]
far more qualified...[N]
In any case, I cannot falter now.[X]

## Chapt14Diary
We've made it to the palace.[N]
Only one thing remains.[N]
This war will finally come[N]
to an end.[N][N]
Somehow, I feel it's not[N]
truly the end yet.[N]
After all, what of the[N]
missing soldiers?[N]
There's no sign so far[N]
of them anywhere...[N][N]
For now, we have to focus.[N]
For everyone who has fallen,[N]
we must win.[X]

## Chapt15Diary
The war's finally over,[N]
the prince is alive,[N]
and I think Sir Elcorian[N]
is proud of what I've done.[N]
Once we've finished figuring[N]
out what to do with Yg'stra,[N]
I think life might return[N]
to normal.[N][N]
It's almost sad, in a way.[N]
It's been a rough road,[N]
but I've met so many people.[N]
Then again, this doesn't[N]
have to be the end![X]

## Chapt16Diary
...It's not the end.[N]
And I can't turn my back.[N]
Whoever attacked Elba Cor[N]
is a threat to all of us.[N][N]
On the bright side, Prince[N]
Zeke is a capable fighter,[N]
and an all-around nice guy.[N]
Hopefully, we'll solve[N]
this mystery together.[X]

## Chapt17Diary
To get to Holanis, we have[N]
to travel through the Lowlands.[N]
I've never been through them,[N]
but they seem exciting![N]
Besides the rampant banditry.[N][N]
The ashfall covering the land[N]
is mystifying, in a way.[N]
And, I believe one of my[N]
textbooks mentioned the ash[N]
helping the wildlife grow![N]
...If only it could help[N]
us out, too.[X]

## Chapt18Diary
Still in the Lowlands.[N]
More mountains than I expected.[N]
They're not exactly what[N]
I'd call [OpenQuote]low,[CloseQuote] after all.[N][N]
How long has it been since[N]
Loile erupted? How is there[N]
still ash in the skies?[N]
...I'd best not think[N]
about this too much.[X]

## Chapt19Diary
We're finally in Holanis![N]
It's... remarkably similar[N]
to the Lowlands, currently.[N]
Zeke's talked about his home[N]
in Eastern Holanis, which is[N]
apparently far more colorful.[N][N]
There's a chance we'll have[N]
to go there anyway, but if[N]
not, I'd like to see it.[N]
That's something this journey's[N]
made me apprciate. Seeing[N]
more of the world than Dalst.[X]

## Chapt20Diary
That river facility was almost[N]
unbelievable to see. Draining[N]
a riverbed like that, all to[N]
make finding fossils easier...[N]
In any case, if Holanis has[N]
that power, who knows what[N]
else they may have?[N][N]
Zeimstadt might have answers,[N]
or it might not. All I know[N]
is that we're the only ones[N]
who can find those answers.[N]
Either way, we can't dawdle.[N]
The mercenaries are waiting.[N][N]
...Also, on an unrelated note,[N]
I'm tired of the color grey.[X]

## Chapt21Diary
The revelations within Zeimstadt[N]
were terrifying. The dragons[N]
we've witnessed from a bygone[N]
era were in fact, that.[N]
Beings ripped from a bygone[N]
era, given new artificial life.[N]
If Holanis has that power,[N]
none of us are safe.[N][N]
We're rushing to Jraeyan[N]
now. Our only hope is that[N]
the mercenaries will be[N]
enough to help us match[N]
the dragons' power.[N][N]
...Still, for such a sparse[N]
country to be able to support[N]
artificial dragons...[N]
Something's not right here.[X]

## Chapt22Diary
...A lot has happened.[N][N]
The mercenaries we had hired[N]
are all dead. The missing[N]
soldiers from Aercolyn have[N]
been found.[N][N]
Dalst appears to be behind[N]
both of these occurances.[N][N]
Any trust in them that I had[N]
has now been shattered.[N]
All I can do now is return[N]
home and demand answers.[N]
Demand justice.[N]
If I must, I will fight.[N][N]
It's... the least I owe[N]
everyone, after what they've[N]
all gone through.[X]

## Chapt23Diary
It seems that Dalst hired[N]
mercenaries of their own from[N]
Mevion. ...We're their enemy[N]
now. How do they know, though?[N][N]
Whatever the case, we must keep[N]
pressing onwards towards home.[N]
We stopped in Gohranos to arm[N]
ourselves, and we're about to[N]
tread through the marshlands.[N][N]
...Let's hope our road back[N]
is somewhat peaceful.[X]

## Chapt24Diary
General Neillstrom is dead.[N]
He brought Yg'stra against us,[N]
and threatened to silence the[N]
truth... He had to fall.[N]
Even so... It doesn't quite[N]
feel real.[N][N]
There's truly no going back[N]
now. Dalst is now and forever[N]
our enemy.[N][N]
...The road home grows longer[N]
and wearier, but what other[N]
choice do we have?[X]

## Chapt25Diary
We're out of the Lowlands.[N]
Aercolyn is so close.[N]
...It's a far more somber[N]
return than I ever imagined.[N][N]
...What more is there to say?[N]
All I can do is pray that the[N]
people of my homeland are[N]
faring alright with Dalst.[X]

[N]
E.C. 581[N]
Heed my orders, and Yg'stra[N]
all shall be yours for the[N]
taking. You are a force of[N]
nature, and it is only right[N]
for you to lay claim to it.[N]
All we ask of you for now[N]
is to borrow the Arkhinal.[N]
Its regenerative properties[N]
are of... great interest to us.[N]
Know that however long it takes,[N]
you shall be given what you truly[N]
deserve, champion.[N]
[N]
Sure thing, boss. Though those[N]
bastards have slighted my skill[N]

nothing, and entrust me with[N]
their sacred weapon. One day,[N]
I'll put them all in their place.[N]
