Ah, Blair. Good to see you.[N]
I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]
I felt since we had time, I should[N]
make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]
devoted the basics of Opistinian magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
but I find it relaxing.[A][N]
I'll do whatever you think best.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd stick with what you're[N]
best at, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anima magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
On that note[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I think I have a strong tome somewhere.[N]
That'll be good for practice.[A][N]

Light magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
It'll cover anima's weakness nicely.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]

Dark magic? Understandable.[N]
It's always good to push oneself.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

You know, when you're not constantly[N]
being attacked by bandits,[A][N]
the Lowlands are surprisingly nice.[A][N]
There's a beauty within the ashes.[N]
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad to be away from Mevion.[N]
It's nice, of course.[A][N]

conjure a flame like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know,I could probably show you.[N]
If you're interested.[A][N]
You're already good with staves[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
How hard could it be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Show me how to use magic? I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'd be honored, Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't get it. How the[N]
hell do people live here?[A][N]
Can't do one damned thing without[N]
getting soot in every orifice.[A][N]
Least there's no shortage of[N]
goons to give a bonk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nobody would fault you if you[N]
returned to your tent.[A][N]
Feel free to take respite from[N]
the ash.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nah. It's fine. Besides, it's[N]
a rather remarkable view here.[A][N]
The moonlight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How it reflects off[N]
the ashen dusts[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's nice.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell anyone I said that, or[N]

Well, yes it is! Your blonde friend[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Natasia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] She taught me a thing or two.[A][N]
Turns out swinging an axe is some[N]
good stress relief![A][N]
Plus, we need the firewood anyway.[N]
It's pretty swell all around.[A][N]
Maybe I'll teach her the basics[N]
of staffing sometime.[A][N]
I told her I wouldn't teach her[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I could learn to teach.[A][N]
Probably.[A] Anyway, keep well,[N]
and tell her I said hello.[A][X]
