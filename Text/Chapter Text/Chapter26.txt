Survive for[N]
15 turns.[X]

##C26AnnihilatorExplanation
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Interesting[...][A][N]
Annihilation's still unstable enough[N]
to wreak such havok on its users.[A][N]
I suppose our sages will need a moment[N]
to adjust to the tome's power.[A][N]
No matter. Once that moment passes,[N]
none shall survive our assault.[A][X]

##C26OlsenAppearance
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOlsen][ToggleSmile]
[...]A swell day for a great battle.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Bit of a bummer to have to fight against[N]
the losing side, though.[A][N]
That's like kicking a dog when it's down.[N]
And I like dogs.[A][X]



##C26CiraweissBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You will fall just as they did.[A][N]
One by one. Swiftly.[A][N]
All for the sake of our[N]
ideal world.[A][N]
[...]Really, this is an honor.[N]
The best way to die.[A][N]
Know that your life had[N]
some manner of meaning.[A][X]

##C26CiraweissDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Power[...][N]
Too[...] much power[...][A][N]
How in the hell[...][N]
have you gotten[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
No[...] matter[...][A][N]
This will never[...] end[...][A][N]
He will[...] never[...][N]
let[...] it[...] end[...][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungEthyl]
Should I be concerned for you?[A][N]
Don't think your absences have[N]
gone unnoticed, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Jraeyan's been under our control[N]
for[...] What, three years now?[A][N]
And has anything substantial[N]
come of it?[A] One iota that[N]
justifies their crimes?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not as of yet.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know you put a lot on the line[N]
with them.[A] But I think it's[N]
better we cut our losses.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look at the bigger picture.[A][N]
We let them go free, they find[N]
themselves another stronghold,[A][N]
and they're back to doing what[N]
they did with Sinclair.[A][N]
I am[...] Dalst is keeping them[N]
in check.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is this truly simpler than just[N]
killing them and being done with it?[A][N]
It's harsh, but it would be over[N]
and done with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] want to believe that their[N]
knowledge can better Ulmaron.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Guess that's what separates us.[N]
You will never let this end.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]I understand where you're coming[N]
from.[A] You've put far too much into[N]
this place. Met some smart people.[A][N]
You don't want to lose that.[A][N]
So you keep digging yourself[N]
deeper.[A] [...]And I can't say[N]
I don't get it.[A][N]
I wouldn't want to admit I've wasted[N]
three years of my life either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd hardly say it was wasted.[A][N]
Just that[...] our goals are[N]
long-term.[A][N]
[...]I do truly need your assistance.[A][N]
You've one of the finest[N]
minds around.[A][N]
And you're the only other in[N]
Dalst who knows of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn it. Fine.[A][N]
[...]Wait, you still haven't[N]
told Elcorian of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] hasn't come up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've never a thought you haven't[N]
immediately told him.[A][N]
[...]Are you trying to protect him[N]
from this? From you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] In fact, maybe[N]
it IS about time he knew.[A][N]
But enough of that. Let you[N]
and I return to what we know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of course, old friend.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] know this hasn't all[N]
been a waste.[A][N]
All our understanding is to[N]
create a glorious future.[A][X]
