[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBechamel]
Ho! Prince![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's up, Bechamel?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I thought it be worth mention[N]
that I grew up in these Lowlands.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, really? Interesting.[N]
How'd you end up a pirate?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, it be complicated. Me sis'[N]
and I wanted escape.[A][N]
It be called a hellscape fer[N]
good reason, mate.[A][N]
Anyhows, many years back, we found[N]
our lucky break:[A] a merchant[N]
caravan wit' a light load.[A][N]
Me an' 'er snuck aboard, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
She was caught.[A][N]
Thrown back into the hell[N]
of our homeland.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And they never noticed you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alas, nay. I still wonder if[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
If I should've gone back.[A][N]
Well, it be too late fer regrets.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you have any useful information[N]
that might help our strategy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The Lowlands be terrible.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, Bechamel.[A][X]

##C17_Blair_Yuyu_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu][OpenMidLeft]
If I may ask, Yuyu[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why'd you join us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was bored.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's all?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why'd you join the war?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I wouldn't say join as[N]
much as dragged in-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never mind. It won't be interesting.[N]
I can tell.[A][N]
Look, I always need something going on.[N]
That's just who I am.[A][N]
And, hey. Lookie here! A war's[N]
an endless source of stimuli![A][N]
Sure, it's not all fun and games,[N]
but what is?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Besides chess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Anyway, speaking of fun[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][LoadBlair]
I'm gonna go do lord-y things.[N]
See ya, Blair![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
W-wait! Yuyu![A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
You can't handle the weight[N]
of this responsibility![A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBlair]
The question of how much weight[N]
I can handle is up for debate.[A][N]
Toodles![A][X]

##C17_Damien_Zacharias_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZacharias][OpenMidRight][LoadDamien]
Well, friend. We're quite far[N]
from Yg'stra now, I'd say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that all?[N]
No other thoughts?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, I'm just here cause you are.[N]
If anyone needs thoughts, it's you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose so. I guess I'm still here[N]
cause it's a journey![A] We're on[N]
a journey to help people.[A][N]
That's the kind of fulfilment[N]
I enjoy, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And I've got nothing much going on.[N]
May as well lend you an arm.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You don't want more?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You just said yourself. Fulfilment[N]
by helping others.[A] Is that not[N]
what me tagging along is?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair point. In any case, thanks.[N]
You've been wonderful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup.[A][X]

##C17_Peggy_Apollo_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Good day, miss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, you're back. Sorry if I[N]
snapped at you a while back.[A][N]
As I said, while divine power[N]
is great and all,[A] I'd rather rely[N]
on what I myself can do.[A][N]
All those soldiers who fought back[N]
during the Revolution[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Everyone we're fighting with now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
All those wounds I've healed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Sure, Opistus might be providing the[N]
brunt of the power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I'm the reason they're all alive.[N]
Hundreds would've died without me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Would those souls perhaps not be[N]
better off in His grasp?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you asking if I should just[N]
let people die?[A][N]
Do you ask a bee to not make honey?[N]
A pirate to not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do piratey things?[A][N]
I heal people. Not doing so because of[N]
some promise of an afterlife is asinine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. I, personally, tend to agree.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then why'd you ask, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It was just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] on my mind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've got a strange mind, pal.[A][X]

##C17_Arin_Desmond_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
You're in fine form.[N]
But that's hardly surprising.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate that, Desmond.[N]
It's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] exhausting, for sure.[A][N]
But with the prince here, I feel[N]
that I'm somewhat[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] less needed.[A][N]
Like I've more time to myself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, I suppose some of the burdens Lady[N]
Blair has left on you have dissipated.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you content with that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You were in quite the unique circumstances[N]
for the longest time.[A] One with no[N]
formal training acting as an advisor.[A][N]
Clearly, an effective one, given what[N]
we were able to accomplish.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And your point?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you miss being relied upon?[A][N]
For what it's worth, I'm of the opinion[N]
that the way things are now are fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's a hard one.[A][N]
As I said, I appreciate the room[N]
to breathe, in any case.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. In a way, not having to deal[N]
with oversight myself has been liberating.[A][N]
But I'd much rather go back to the way[N]
things were before.[A][CloseEyes] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For obvious reasons.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas, until this mystery's solved,[N]
nothing can be as it was before.[A][X]

##C17_Blair_Zeke_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Tell me about your time[N]
in Holanis, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Should this not wait?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can prepare for battle and[N]
talk at the same time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I grew up in a small village,[N]
somewhere in the east, I believe.[A][N]
When I say small, I mean several[N]
dozen people, at most.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They all knew who you were?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's correct. To my understanding,[N]
they had been sworn to silence.[A][N]
I like to think it didn't impact[N]
what they thought of me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder how they're doing.[N]
Money might be getting tight.[A][N]
If I remember correctly, one of the[N]
woodcutters mentioned a mercenary group.[A][N]
That'd be something, if we hired[N]
someone I've known for years.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. Now it's only fair[N]
for you to regale me.[A][N]
Spin me a tale, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, would you look at that?[N]
Time for the battle.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Wait! You're not getting out of[N]
this that easily![A][X]

##C17_Stefan_Kenneth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft]
Sir Kenneth! A word, if you will?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose I could spare[N]
a few words on you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Your father, Tarquin von Neillstrom[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He's a warrior beyond compare, no?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's what people say, and I'm[N]
inclined to agree.[A][N]
But why bring him up now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why not call upon him?[A][N]
Could he not singlehandedly do what[N]
it takes ten of us to match?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He's a busy man, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Too busy for his son?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The scoundrel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not the word I'd use, personally.[A][N]
In any case, even if he were free,[N]
I don't think I'd want the help.[A][N]
I'm me, and he's him. No need to[N]
draw me into comparisons.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't resent him. Far from it.[N]
He's a brilliant man in his own right.[A][N]
But I want to be more than just[N]
the son of a brilliant man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Forgive my prodding.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eh. I'm used to it from you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll take what I can get.[A][X]
