You're familiar with fightin' in[N]
the dark, right, lassie?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yup! Fought off some[N]
Mevionese.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Good, good. Won't haf'ta start[N]
at the beginnin'.[A] The big difference[N]
with the Loile bandits is their traps.[A][N]
You might've seen torches before,[N]
and them Loiles have torches too.[A][N]
But think about this-[A] they live in[N]
this ashen darkness all the time.[A][N]
What purpose might a torch serve them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think I get it. If we light[N]
a torch,[A] that tells them they've[N]
got bad company.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ye pick up quickly![A][N]
Be careful if you light any torches,[N]
as that may signal our foes.[A][N]
Course, if you can handle it, you may[N]
want to fight some more baddies![A][N]
Worst case, I'll be out there wit' ya,[N]
so victory is basically assured.[A][X]
