[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Ah, Blair. I've been looking for you.[N]
Mind looking over this?[A][N]
I've been compiling a report on[N]
what we saw at the border.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]Is now really the best time?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Right, right. Slipped my mind.[N]
[...]Perhaps after the battle, then?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure. Wait[...][N]
Is that the report?[A][N]
It's[...] ginormous! It's only been a day or two![N]
How have you written that much?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]What you guys call downtime,[N]
I call optimal working hours.[A][N]
Plus, I guess you could say I find the[N]
process[...] therapeutic, I suppose.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose I'm just surprised.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I also tend to stay awake far[N]
later into the night than most.[A][N]
Given our separate sleeping arrangements,[N]
I can understand overlooking that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Just[...] make sure to take care[N]
of yourself.[A] Can't have you falling[N]
asleep during a battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Relax. I've done this for years, now.[N]
It's only caused problems[...] three times?[A][N]
I try not to dwell on it.[A] But I appreciate[N]
your concern.[A] Anyway, apologies for[N]
taking your time. I shall take my leave.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's no worry at all! Always[N]
glad to chat.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft] [...]If that report's[N]
as long as it looks,[A] I may have made[N]
a grave mistake[...][A][X]

I never imagined that I'd end up leading[N]
my friends into battle like this.[A][N]
Thought life would be[...] I don't[N]
know, simpler.[A] Peaceful.[A][N]
If any of you don't want to fight,[N]
I won't force you.[A] You can return[N]
home at any time.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]And leave you alone?[N]
I wouldn't be caught dead.[A][N]
Besides, some people need to learn[N]
their place in the world.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]It's an ample opportunity to practice[N]
what I've learned.[A] A real rarity,[N]
these days.[A] Besides, I'm no idiot.[N]
I won't die pointlessly.[A][N]
[OpenRight]So your death is still on the table.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]That's[...] clearly not what[...][A][N]
[...]Forget it.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]No need to be so humorless, Kenneth.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Oh, that reminds me! I got this[N][MoveFarRight]
from my village.[A] Genuine pure water![N]
Thought it might help if we run into mages.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]That's quite brilliant![N]
Who shall carry it?[A][N]
[OpenRight]Blair and I are likely fine[N]
against magic already.[A][N]
Between her anima and my staves, we're[N]
constantly exposed to magical energies.[A][N]
[...]I think that's how it works?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Then that would make the natural choice-[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]That's right! You, Kenneth![N]
You need all the help you can get.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][...]I'm a mage. I'd imagine[N]
you'd need it more.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][...]Here you go, Kenneth.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Are you really doing this now?[N]
[...]Alright, then.[A] Don't come crying if[N]
you're fried to a crisp.[A][X]
