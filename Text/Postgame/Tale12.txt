##Tale12Opening
[OpenRight][LoadMichael][OpenFarRight][LoadNathaniel]
Whew[...] I don't think I'll ever[N]
quite understand this place.[A][N]
Who knew the ruins of Jraeyan[N]
went so deep underground?[A][N]
You still holding up alright, Mike?[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course, Nathan. You dare make[N]
light of my devotion to science?[A][N]
You dare question the lengths to[N]
which I'd go for my pursuits?[A][N]
For shame, knave! For shame![N]
I would crawl through hell![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]So you would.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Can't say I would, but you've[N]
known the boss a bit longer.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Maybe he's inspired you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSinclair]
[...]If the two of you are done.[A][N][OpenRight]
Course, Sinclair. Just takin'[N]
a quick breather.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I suppose you'll need it.[A][N]
The map claims that the innermost[N]
sanctum is[...] right here.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's[...] quite the walk. Who in the[N]
hell built these corridors?[A][N][OpenRight]
You have staves. Can't you just[N]
warp to the end?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
In this darkness?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're walking. Get moving.[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure, boss. Just yell if[N]
you need me to shoot.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We've not encountered a living[N]
soul in this whole dungeon.[A][N]
I can't imagine one now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am of the same mind.[N]
[...]Onwards. No complaining.[A][X]
