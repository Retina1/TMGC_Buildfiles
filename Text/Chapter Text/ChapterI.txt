##ViridianArcPrimer
Welcome to the Viridian Chapters![A][N]
Similar to the Zeke Chapters,[N]
you'll focus on a small party.[A][N]
A few notes for Viridian's maps:[A][N]
-Viridian has a convoy that can hold[N]
up to 50 items,[A] as well as a[N]
separate gold supply from Blair.[A][N]
-Just like Zeke's maps, any unit[N]
death will be a game over.[A][N]
-You will get access to base[N]
preparations starting next map.[A][N]
-Some maps may force deploy large[N]
amounts of units.[A] Remember that[N]
you can rearrange force-deploys.[A][N]
Thanks for sticking with this hack[N]
for so long, and good luck![A][X]

Clarque[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What are you doing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Viridian. Good to see[N]
my protege is well.[A][N]
I took a job. That's all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How could you? Don't you see[N]
what these brutes have done?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What of it?[A][N]
I have nothing left in[N]
this world.[A][N]
Nothing left tying me[N]
to this country.[A][N]
Do you remember my sons?[A][N]
They all threw themselves into[N]
battle, and they all died.[A][N]
Why should I deserve a peaceful[N]
end? A glorious end?[A][N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Listen to yourself. You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
done so many great things.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You've taught me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so much.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've failed him.[N]
We've failed everyone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It certainly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
could've gone better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Does it ever get easier?[N]
This life? People dying?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It doesn't. It never gets easier.[A][N]
But in a way[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's a blessing.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It keeps you human. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're something[N]
special.[A] 'Twould be a shame for you[N]
to lose yourself to heartlessness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for everything, Clarque.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can't throw in the towel[N]
just because you've screwed up once.[A][N]
Don't tell me that's your intent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not at all. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
need some time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. I care about you.[N]
Don't forget that.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I have nothing left, Viridian.[N]
My sons are gone.[A][N]
My pride is gone. At least let[N]
me die with a weapon in hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I refuse to strike you down.[N]
I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] old friend.[A][N]
I wish I could give you that[N]
mercy.[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] But I'm not strong[N]
enough, I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So what, then? Are we gonna stare at[N]
each other until the end of time?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've had ample time to strike[N]
me down.[A] And yet, you've held your[N]
weapons back.[A] You don't want this.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Retreat, and live. My friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're[N]
right, Viridian.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I'm leaving,[N]
at least take this.[A][N]
You'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] find a use for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A] Where shall[N]
you go, now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know, anymore.[N]
But I'll find a way forward.[A][N]
And I'll pay you back someday.[A][X]
