[...]So, you've served my father?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Correct. It's been[...] what,[N]
forty years now?[A][N]
[...]I'm getting old.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My father[...] What is he like?[N]
I hardly remember him.[A][N]
And[...] Anything I thought[N]
I knew from letters was a lie.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your father[...] King Brandl[...][N]
He's a just man.[A][N]
He'll stand for his people until[N]
his dying breath.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He's also, as I said, a skilled marksman.[A][N]
You're quite young, but I already see[N]
his talent shining through in you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I wonder if[...] if he'll[N]
be proud of me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, your highness.[A][N]
But we can talk your father[N]
later. We must proceed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Hyperius. My apologies.[A][X]

[...]I never said you have to stay.[N]
Just for the record.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't give me that. I saw[N]
that glare you gave me.[A][N]
If I left, you would've found me.[N]
And judged me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're a brilliant fighter.[N]
Why did you leave?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I never wanted this life.[N]
Does ANYONE want this life?[A][N]
Serving a crowned head that can[N]
toss them away on a whim?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Our king is a righteous man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Whatever you say. Clearly,[N]
you're beyond saving.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So, have you just been wandering[N]
around these past three years?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yeah. Can't say it's easy.[N]
But it's fulfilling.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Again, you know you can[N]
leave whenever you want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][X]

##LeilaDamienCSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeila][OpenMidRight][LoadDamien]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
You're something striking.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can't say you're too bad,[N]
yourself. Name's Leila.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Damien. Friendly neighborhood[N]
guy with a bow and arrow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Try not to point that thing[N]
at me. I'd appreciate that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing. [...]Then again, I haven't[N]
had pegasus before.[A][N]
Toby'd be able to grill up[N]
some killer peg, I'm sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Toby?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Uncle Toby. You wouldn't know him.[N]
Great guy, not actually my uncle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. That makes perfect sense.[N]
Well. Nice meeting you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Same here.[A][X]

What's that silent treatment[N]
for, big guy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Who are you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Leila? The flier?[N]
Did you[...] forget?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Then why are you ignoring me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see no reason to talk to you.[N]
I'd rather not waste my time.[A][N]
Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
What a rude man. [...]But there's[N]
something about him.[A][N]
Something intriguing.[A][X]

You've been holding up well, prince.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As have you, Hyperius. Clearly,[N]
age can't hold you back.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've served four decades.[N]
I'll gladly make it five.[A][N]
Or six. [...]Seven's pushing it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good one. [...]Since we're nearing[N]
the capital[...] my home[...][A][N]
Is there[...] anything else[N]
that I should know about?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The crown's certainly made some unique[N]
allies, I'll say.[A][N]
Your father has rapport with something[N]
of a pirate king.[A][N]
In fact, that connection is likely part of what[N]
brought the Yg'stran invasion to an end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How do pirates end a war?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's not the complete picture.[A][N]
Assuming that all went to plan, the pirates[N]
were to escort a young noblewoman.[A][N]
She was to make contact with Opistia,[N]
and from there[...][A][N]
Well, we can assume that something[N]
went right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad to hear that.[N]
Maybe I'll meet them one day.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure you will. At the very least,[N]
the lady'll have to return.[A][N]
Postwar negotiations'll be a challenge,[N]
your highness.[A][N]
It's a turbulent time to return.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes[...] But it had to happen.[N]
And I'll have you at my side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, prince. I'd be honored.[A][X]

How have you been holding up,[N]
Alexis? We're nearly back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sir! I've been well![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! Glad to see your enthusiasm[N]
has not yet dulled.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is a glorious age for[N]
the land of Elba Cor![A][N]
Enthusiasm is quite appropriate,[N]
Sir Hyperius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose you're right, young one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The end of a war[...][N]
The return of a prince[...][A][N]
It's almost too good[N]
to believe, sir![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know you don't have to keep[N]
calling me sir, right?[A][N]
We've been through enough that[N]
I'm fine with Hyperius.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Pinch me, sir.[N]
I must be dreaming![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm waiting, sir![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]At ease, Alexis.[A][X]
