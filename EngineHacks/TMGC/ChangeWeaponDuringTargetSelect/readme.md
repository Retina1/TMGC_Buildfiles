# Change Weapon During Target-Select

A interesting rework on `SelectTargetProc` so that we can change weapon during target-selection.

Now `Up & Down` botton will change the target, meanwhile `Left & Right` button could make you change another weapon to attack. If you don't have any other weapons to attack current target, then the `Left & Right` will function as vanilla to try change target.
