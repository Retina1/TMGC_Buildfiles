[...]Well. I see you're finally awake.[A][N]
[...]Suppose awake's not quite the most[N]
correct term to use here.[A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight] [...]Details.[A][N]
You may be wondering why you're here,[N]
Addington.[A] Well, from one scholar to[N]
another, I am requesting your aid.[A][N]
I require someone to proofread all that[N]
I've written these past few years.[A][N]
I've amassed stories of those we knew[N]
from the war, past and present.[A][N]
I know your expertise is mathematics,[N]
but I'm sure you can do some reading.[A][N]
[...]If you're interested, I've statues[N]
set up around this hall.[A][N]
Visual identification of our allies.[N]
My notes are at their feet.[A][N]
Give them all a good once-over, and[N]

##TaleHubExplanation
Welcome to the Postgame![A][N]
Here, you can partake in a[N]
selection of Trial Maps.[A][N]
Each map gives you preset units[N]
with preset items and skills,[A][N]
in a scenario that either occurs[N]
before or after the main story.[A][N]
To begin a map, interact with one[N]
of the units scattered in this hub.[A][N]
Grey units mark incomplete maps,[N]
while green units mark complete maps.[A][N]
Right now, there are ten trial maps[N]
available,[A] and if you complete all[N]
of them, a bonus map will unlock.[A][N]
By the way, if you ever lose your[N]
trial map save, don't fret.[A][N]
You'll have the choice to start in this[N]
hub when starting a new game now.[A][N]
Thank you for playing, and good luck[N]
uncovering the Tales of Ulmaron![A][X]
