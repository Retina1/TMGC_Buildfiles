Rachael. Cassius. Thank you[N]
for your service to Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
What's all this about, your majesty?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Cassius. This is the king.[N]
Do you HAVE to question him?[A][N][OpenRight]
Peace, Rachael. It is all right.[A][N]
You two have gone above and beyond your[N]
station, and deserve to be recognized.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Just doin' my job, sir.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hardly, Cassius. Your job is that of[N]
a messenger, not of a soldier.[A][N]
Especially a soldier instrumental[N]
to ending this cruel war.[A][N]
For your service, I present to you[N]
this axe. The Galerider.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[...] Thank you, your majesty.[N]
[...]Feels right in my hands.[A][N][OpenRight]
Folklore speaks of a brave rider valiantly[N]
charging into battle,[A] the axe channeling[N]
his courage into protection.[A][N]
May it do the same to you.[A][N]
As for you, Rachael, I present[N]
the Flying Spike.[A][N]
I trust you've heard of it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The lance the first king's general[N]
took into battle?[A][N]
I[...] I can't.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course you can, Rachael.[A][N]
You two are truly something[N]
special. Don't forget that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Well, then. Guess we gotta[N]
watch out for each other.[A][N]
Even more, I mean. Wouldn't want[N]
to betray the legends.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I won't let you falter,[N]
and I trust you to do the same to me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Sure, why not.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenFarRight][LoadLeila][OpenRight][LoadBrandl][OpenFarRight]
[...]Why did you bring me here?[A][N][OpenRight]
I remember you, Leila. You were[N]
something truly special.[A][N]
It may not be my place to ask, but[N]
what caused you to leave?[A][N]
You had so much potential[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I have nothing to say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that all? After everything?[N]
You've nothing to say?[A][N][OpenRight]
Peace, Hyperius. She's made her choice.[N]
Still, you brought my son back.[A][N]
That warrants something.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Say. Where's that blonde one?[N]
The one who latched onto me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you mean Rachael?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Unfortunately, she has fallen.[N]
Lost to the Yg'stran campaign.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]In any case. This is for you.[N]
The blade Courante.[A][N]
It's said that its original user[N]
was a-[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's meaningless to me. What[N]
matters is how I use it.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]That's why I left.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Apologies, your majesty.[A][N][OpenRight]
It is[...] alright, Hyperius.[A][N][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]
(Does she truly just wish to make her[N]
own way? To not be shackled to the past?)[A][X]

##C15_Blair_Zeke_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
Are you certain you wish to fight[N]
alongside us?[A] I've no idea what[N]
may be ahead.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It is alright[...] milady. If there is[N]
a threat towards my homeland,[A][N]
it is my duty to protect it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can tell you're set on this.[N]
Very well.[A] Your father has done[N]
much for me.[A] I shall pay that[N]
kindness unto you.[A][N]
Do[...] Do you wish to lead?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I shall leave that to you. You've surely[N]
formed a bond of trust with your army.[A][N]
It would be quite undue of me to[N]
disturb it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand. In that case[...][N]
Tell me about yourself, a bit.[A][N]
If you're to fight alongside us,[N]
we should know who you are![A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[...] true. Hm[...][N]
I'm Zeke. You[...] knew that.[A][N]
I fight with lance and bow[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not that. I meant tell me about[N]
who you REALLY are![A][N]
What drives and motivates you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's quite[...] out there.[A][N]
But, alright. I'll think about it.[N]
Not now, though. We've got to prepare.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. My bad. Got carried[N]
away there.[A] Truly, though.[N]
I hope we can be friends.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As do I, milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Call me Blair, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright, Blair.[A][X]

##C15_Stefan_Carbon_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon][OpenMidLeft]
Ho! Carbon![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's up? Why'd you[N]
blow my eardrums out?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're both young and skilled horsemen.[N]
I wish to cross swords with you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm more of a bowman myself,[N]
but sure. Why not.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! Know that I'll not go[N]
easy on you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yup. En garde, and all that.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight]
[...]Ha![A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight]
Too slow![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCarbon][OpenRight]
Where'd you go?[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[...]Gotcha.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadStefan]
[...]Well done, friend![N]
How'd you beat my famed charge?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Your slow and telegraphed[N]
charge? No clue.[A][N]
Course, I'd imagine most enemies won't[N]
be as mobile as me.[A][N]
That's why I'm so lightly armored.[N]
It's what I value.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course[...][N]
An interesting proposition[...][A][N]
It was good to spar, Carbon![N]
Next time, I'll win for sure.[A][N][X]

[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see you're back.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Wha[...]?[A] Oh, it's just you.[A][N]
What do you need of me,[N]
a second rate con?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Second rate's selling yourself too highly.[N]
[...]I noticed your form.[A][N]
Most thieves, in combat, aim to flee.[N]
After all, they're weak.[A][N]
They're frail targets taken out by[N]
a single strike.[A][N]
But you[...] Your fighting style[N]
belies that. You're bold.[A][N]
Just a thing I noticed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What're you tryin' to say,[N]
old man?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just saying, you're either hiding[N]
something, or you're asking to die.[A][N]
And I know you. You're afraid to die.[N]
Aren't you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-absolutely not. This is the path[N]
I chose. I'll get[...] no salvation.[A][N]
No respite at the end.[A][N]
And that's how[...] I want it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure. Well, if you decide otherwise,[N]
I'll be around.[A][N]
There's something within you[N]
worth a damn, I'm sure.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][X]

##C15_Zeke_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Ah[...] You'd be one of the[N]
Elba Corian knights, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Woah! Prince! [...]I wouldn't go that[N]
far, your highnessness[...][A][N]
But I'm definitely a part of the regime.[N]
The name's Cassius. Arcasen.[A][N]
[...]That last name means nothing[N]
to you. Why'd I say it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sorry to trouble you. I had wanted to[N]
acquaint myself with Blair's troops.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for your service.[N]
For my father, that is.[A][N]
I hope to become a worthy successor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of[...] Of course, prince.[N]
Sorry for losin' my cool.[A][N]
It's just[...] quite unbelievable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've gotten that a lot. It's[...] comforting,[N]
in a way. People feeling this way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure is.[N]
Keep yourself well, prince.[A][X]

##C15_Rachael_Hyperius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
General. It's good to see you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
At ease, Rachael. Same to you.[N]
How has the war treated you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's been[...] draining, to say the least.[N]
But there's no rest for the dutiful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Especially now, with the prince's return.[N]
There is much to be done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's truly nothing short of a miracle.[N]
If I may[...] How did you know?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've had my suspicions for many years now.[N]
Count Marius's behavior had been[...][A][N]
Well, troubling, to put it simply.[A][N]
But it wasn't until after his passing[N]
that I could investigate further.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. It's quite unfortunate that war broke[N]
out right before you left for Holanis.[A][N]
Though[...] If I may ask, why didn't you[N]
just[...] hold off?[A][N]
You had been biding your time for years,[N]
general. What would've been another month?[A][N]
Or another two? Why did this need to happen[N]
during a war?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Apologies. I overstepped my bounds, there.[N]
I'm sure you had your reasons, general.[A][N]
[...]We ought to prepare.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of[...] Of course.[A][X]

##C15_Apollo_Charley_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley][OpenMidLeft]
Say, Charley. You're from[N]
Opistia, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's correct. Though, I had[N]
been away for several months.[A][N]
Funnily enough, I was in Elba[N]
Cor not too long ago.[A][N]
Moneubris, I believe?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's where I was, as a matter[N]
of fact.[A] Before I joined this[N]
group, I mean.[A][N]
If it weren't for that pirate raid,[N]
who knows where I'd be now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly worth dwelling on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. In any case, as long as I[N]
trust in Opistus, all shall end well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Indeed.[A][X]
