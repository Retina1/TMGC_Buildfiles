[OpenMidRight]
Lady Blair.[N]
It's been... some time.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir Elcorian![A][N]
It truly has been a long time.[N]
Why have I been called here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Obviously, after your father's[N]
actions,[A] the status of Aercolyn[N]
has been... dubious, shall we say.[A][N]
However, after extensive deliberation,[A][N]
the High Dalstian Council has agreed to[N]
initiate the restoration of Aercolyn,[A][N]
provided that, and I quote,[A][N]
[OpenQuote]the state's heir sufficiently proves her[N]
absolute loyalty to the Dalstian Alliance.[CloseQuote][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
What exactly does absolute loyalty entail?[A][N]
...Is it a blood contract?[N]
I'm not good with blood...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hardly anything that savage, Lady.[A][N]
You are simply to travel to the[N]
Dalst-Mevion border.[A][N]
There have been rumors of Mevionese[N]
forces assailing settlements.[A][N]
Of course, you would have to do more[N]
than this to prove your loyalty,[A][N]
but this is... the beginning, shall we say.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That... sounds fairly reasonable.[A][N]
Oh! By the way, on the way here,[N]
we ran into some Dalstian rebels-[A][N]
they were raving about something to[N]
do with Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, our diplomatic talks with Yg'stra.[A][N]
Do people not realize that diplomacy[N]
exists to AVOID bloodshed?[A][N]
Though... it is concerning that we've[N]
gone several weeks with response...[A][N]
In any case, thank you for letting[A][N]
us know.[A] I'll send word to the[N]
council.[A] I believe it's now time[N]
you set off.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Sir Elcorian![N]
I won't let you down.[A][X]

##Ch1_Opening_2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadKenneth]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well... Here we are.[N]
Nothing too out of the ordinary.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Stay alert. I feel as if that's[N]
about to change.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
If I'm not wrong... I think I[N]
see some Mevionese insignia...[A][N]
They appear to be approaching[N]
the nearby villages.[A][N]
They don't seem as if they're planning on[N]
outright pillaging,[A] but this surely[N]
can't be good.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, this appears to be what[N]
Sir Elcorian described.[A][N]
I believe it's up to us[N]
to drive them away![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Oy! What're you lot doin'?[A][N]
If you wanna keep yer heads,[N]
start runnin' now![A][N]
...[A][N]
Well, you've made yer choice![A][N]
Nobility is on the menu[N]
tonight, fellas![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Looks like we don't have a choice here.[N]
We should prepare for battle.[A][N]
If we hold out long enough,[N]
they'll give up. Hopefully.[A][N][X]

Nothing too out of the ordinary.[A][N]

Stay alert. I feel as if that's[N]
about to change.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...What's that off in[N]
the distance?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If I remember correctly...[N]
that's the Mevionese coat of arms.[A][N]
Those men appear to have their[N]
eyes set on these villages.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, this appears to be what[N]
Sir Elcorian described.[A][N]
I believe it's up to us[N]
to drive them away![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Oy! What're you lot doin'?[A][N]
