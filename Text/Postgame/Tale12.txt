##Tale12Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair]
[...]Excellent. This tome's exactly[N]
what I had hoped to find.[A][N]
[...]It's an incomplete record, but[N]
that's hardly a major issue.[A][N]
There's some more I can work[N]
with in the upper strata.[A][N]
I don't say this often, but the[N]
two of you were[...] helpful.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course, boss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What's next?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hm[...] Jraeyan's large. There's[N]
some equipment left over.[A][N]
We may be able to repurpose it.[A][N]
And then, perhaps try our hand[N]
at replicating what we saw.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Will that be alright?[A][N]
Did you not mention having[N]
roots in Dalst?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I shall[...] leverage them.[A][N]
Besides, there is also one in[N]
Dalst that I wish to[...][A][N]
Overcome, one may say.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
And overcome we shall.[A][N]
We hold the power of gods, and[N]
we'll make damn good use of it.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Perhaps that's a little far, but[N]
I do believe we can leave our mark.[A][N]
[...]I'm with you, boss.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Come, then. There is[...][N]
much to be done.[A][N]
Much to learn. Much to[N]
be created.[A][CloseEyes] Much to[N]
be wiped clean.[A][X]

##Tale12AreaConvo1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]So[...] How about that dungeon?[A][N]
Sure was[...] out of my deepest[N]
and darkest nightmares.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're not good at small talk.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What're we lookin' for, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Secrets.[A] Of the world.[A][N]
Of life itself.[A][N][OpenLeft]
That sounds like you don't have[N]
a clue what you're looking for.[A][N]
Like you're making things up to[N]
pretend this means something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Are you trying to antagonise[N]
the big man? Bold of you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hardly. I just[...] I want this[N]
to really mean something.[A][N]
This being[...] Well, I guess not[N]
just this expedition.[A][N]
My whole life. I want people[N]
to remember my name.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I get it.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair][OpenLeft]
What about you, Mike?[A][N]
Don't you wanna change[N]
the world someday?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[OpenQuote]Wanna[CloseQuote]?[A] You act as if[N]
I haven't already.[A][N]
Remember that my writings on[N]
Holanis are why I'm here.[A][N]
Arguably why we're all here![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't act so big. We all know[N]
you just did meta-analysis.[A][N]
All the other scholars got to[N]
Holanis's secrets first.[A][N]
You just summed it all up.[A][N]
[...]Not that that's a useless[N]
act, of course.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Is permutating what's been done[N]
enough to inspire real change?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I[...] I like to think so.[A][N]
[...]This, today. This'll really[N]
be the big one for me.[A][N][CloseEyes]
The one that lets me finally do[N]
something great.[A][OpenEyes] Greater.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair][OpenFarLeft]
[...]How about you, boss?[A][N]
We've spilt some dreams.[N]
Now you better spill.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Power.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Power?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I need answers.[N]
Not a single word.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is it not natural for mankind[N]
to lust for further power?[A][N]
Is that not enough for you?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Good answer.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo4
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Business talk's boring.[A][N]
I'm up for some lighter[N]
conversations.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Lighter?[A][N][OpenLeft]
You got any family, Mike?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
None I care for. The solitary[N]
life's better for me anyway.[A][N]
Nobody pokin' around when I go[N]
off to the earth's end.[A][N][OpenLeft]
How about you, boss?[A][N]
You've[...] Well, you're a nobleman.[N]
Don't you have a lover?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]A wife, yes.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
She holds[...] a certain[N]
fascination with this.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
A rarity for her with my[N]
academic works.[A][OpenFarLeft]
If she's so into all this,[N]
why's she not here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Somebody has to look after[N]
our flesh and blood.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Wait, what?[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo5
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair][OpenLeft]
Didn't think you the type[N]
to settle down like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm hardly a settled man.[A][N]
Look at what we're doing[N]
in this moment.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
A kid, eh?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Named Blair. Had it in mind ages ago.[N]
The name, I mean.[A] It's easy. Works[N]
either way. Saved time on naming.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Right.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sinclair[...] Blair[...][A][N]
I don't think you're as good[N]
with names as you think.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Very funny. You try naming[N]
another human on the spot.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Oh, right. That shiny thing[N]
you've been looking at.[A][N]
What exactly IS it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Just[...] a little bauble she gave[N]
me before I left.[A][N]
It's got a little mirror in it.[N]
[...]Lets me see how far I've come.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[...]I think that's supposed to hold[N]
a small portrait.[A] [...]Perhaps of her.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair][OpenLeft]
Ok, really. What's at the[N]
end of all of this?[A][N]
We've been walking for[N]
ages now.[A] Why?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]If you truly must know, fine.[A][N]
Recall the tales of Holanis.[A][N][OpenLeft]
As far as I know, it was wiped[N]
off the map by calamity.[A][N]
Haven't gotten too into it.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
From my studies, it seems like[N]
mighty dragons were involved.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've[...] dug a bit deeper.[A][N]
I think there were two different[...][N]
Well, types of dragon.[A][N]
Not type as in breed. Type as[N]
in[...] manner of being.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In my travels, I've obtained two of[N]
what are nominally the same bone.[A][N]
Two left femurs of long-deceased[N]
earth dragons.[A] Except[...] One[N]
was a typical bone structurally,[A][N]
while the other was entirely solid.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Fully solid bones? Are they not[N]
normally at least a bit hollow?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Bones of that nature would[N]
be far too dense and heavy.[A][N]
At least, for normal beings.[A][N]
[...]My current theory is some manner of[N]
construct.[A] If a false dragon were to[N]
be made by mankind's hands,[A][N]
it'd be far easier to craft fully[N]
solid elements and work around them.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[...] quite the theory.[A][N]
You really think there's some[N]
kinda fake dragons around?[A][N][OpenLeft]
What's that have to do with[N]
these ruins?[A] Isn't this place[N]
Zeimstadt Temple?[A][N]
What's a holy ground gotta do[N]
with this all?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd understand if you took a[N]
single moment to think.[A][N]
The upper reaches are proof this[N]
place was akin to a museum.[A][N]
To[...] preservation, one might say.[A][N]
For a place like that to have[N]
catacombs like this[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You think someone hid life-defying[N]
experiments within a museum?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fine. It's a stretch.[N]
This is my second-place guess.[A][N]
I've plundered Fort Jraeyan, and[N]
have come up mostly empty.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Ah. Carry on, then.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo7
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair]
[...]We're nearing the end.[N]
Look alive, you two.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Why[...] Why is this place[N]
the way it is?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I already told you.[N]
[...]No complaining.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Onwards.[A][X]
##Tale12AreaConvo8
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMichael][OpenLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSinclair]
[...]Look at that. A dragon.[A][N]
Still living in a place like[N]
this, with no resources.[A][N]
[...]Lends more credence to my[N]
current theory.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It appears to be guarding[N]
some manner of object.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
A[...] A desk? I think?[A][N]
Looks like there's some[N]
kind of fancy tome.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]In that case, I say today[N]
we become dragonslayers.[A][N]
If my theory's correct, we[N]
can always just make more.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel]
Your power's great, but so[N]
is mine, dragon.[A][N]
Kneel before my eldritch[N]

what mercy I can afford.[A][X]

##Tale12MichaelBossQuote
[OpenMidRight][LoadMichael]
I'll get you right between[N]
the eyes, lizard.[A][N]
And then[...] I'll be big.[N]
Someone to care about.[A][N]
Your death shall begin my[N]
grand ascendancy![A][X]


##Tale12Opening
[OpenRight][LoadMichael][OpenFarRight][LoadNathaniel]
Whew[...] I don't think I'll ever[N]
quite understand this place.[A][N]
Who knew the ruins of Jraeyan[N]
went so deep underground?[A][N]
You still holding up alright, Mike?[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course, Nathan. You dare make[N]
light of my devotion to science?[A][N]
You dare question the lengths to[N]
which I'd go for my pursuits?[A][N]
For shame, knave! For shame![N]
I would crawl through hell![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]So you would.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Can't say I would, but you've[N]
known the boss a bit longer.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Maybe he's inspired you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSinclair]
[...]If the two of you are done.[A][N][OpenRight]
Course, Sinclair. Just takin'[N]
a quick breather.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I suppose you'll need it.[A][N]
The map claims that the innermost[N]
sanctum is[...] right here.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's[...] quite the walk. Who in the[N]
hell built these corridors?[A][N][OpenRight]
You have staves. Can't you just[N]
warp to the end?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
In this darkness?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're walking. Get moving.[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure, boss. Just yell if[N]
you need me to shoot.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We've not encountered a living[N]
soul in this whole dungeon.[A][N]
I can't imagine one now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am of the same mind.[N]
[...]Onwards. No complaining.[A][X]
