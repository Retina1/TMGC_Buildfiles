*Rustle! Rustle!*[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Um... Excuse me? Has a[N]
rat gotten into our convoy?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff]
*Rust-* Aw, crap.[N]
Guess I deserve this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Are you the fabled[N]
convoy rat?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...What? No. I'm a burglar.[N]
Here to burgle you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see! You must be[N]
a dashing swordsman type.[A][N]
A noble man who embraces the[N]
world's darkness to fight it...[A][N]
How exciting![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm not a dashing anything.[N]
I'm a thief named Jeff.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that a Lancereaver?[N]
Where'd you find it?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...I stole it. From you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope. I'm sure we didn't[N]
have an extra lying around.[A][N]
What a spectacular weapon of choice![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha... Of course...[N]
I can... definitely use it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We could always use another[N]
thief around in our army.[A][N]
Care to join us for the[N]
thrill of adventure?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]How many times do I have to explain?[A][N]
I'm NOTHING special! Just the gutter[N]
trash of Mevion![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't be so hard on yourself.[A][N]
One man's gutter trash is another[N]
man's gutter treasure, after all![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Fine. If it'll shut you up,[N]
I'll stick around.[A] Don't go crying[N]
when your gold goes missing.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Good one, Jeff! I know[N]
you'd never do that.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]...Damn. Called my bluff like that.[A][N]
Well... Maybe this IS a sign.[N]
Maybe it's not too late for me.[A][N]
[CloseEyes](...It's always too late. There's[N]
nothing left for you.)[A][N][OpenEyes]
We'll see about that.[A][X]
