##ViridianArcPrimer
Welcome to the Viridian Chapters![A][N]
Similar to the Zeke Chapters,[N]
you'll focus on a small party.[A][N]
A few notes for Viridian's maps:[A][N]
-Viridian has a convoy that can hold[N]
up to 50 items, and his own gold.[A][N]
-Just like Zeke's maps, any unit[N]
death will be a game over.[A][N]
-Unlike Zeke, Viridian must[N]
always escape last.[A][N]
-Your choices really matter.[A][N]
Good luck, and ready yourself[N]
for a tale of sorrow.[A][X]
