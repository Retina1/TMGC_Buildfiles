##Ch12_Flynn_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah! Hello! I hardly[N]
noticed you there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]Eep![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Wait, don't run away![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn]
...[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Are you going to...[N]
say anything?[A][N]
You appear to be a swordsman...[A][N]
Are you one of those brooding[N]
and silent types?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Sorry, sorry![A][N]
...No. I'm just...[N]
Not great at this.[A][N]
...Talking to people,[N]
I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Fair enough. Might[N]
I at least have your name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Blair. Nice[N]
to meet you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Well, then. I should probably[N]
get back to the task at hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Wait, please. I'd...[N]
like to join you.[A][N]
...You seem kind.[N]
I'd like to repay that kindness.[A][X]

##C12LarondeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
Impressive! But your real[N]
trial begins now.[A][N]
Good luck, and en garde![A][X]

##C12LarondeDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
...I yield.[N]
Well done.[A][N]
You are... more than ready.[N]
Now, we'll just...[A][N]
...Huh?[A][X]

##C12LarondeVsDragonDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
What... is this power...?[N]
I have to run...[A][N]
There's too much...[N]
I must do... Sorry...[A][X]

##C12Huh
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
What is it? Isn't the trial over?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...I hear something. It's...[N]
coming down the stairs.[A][N]
...Is it just me... Or does[N]
the room feel... cold?[A][N][X]

##C12OhNo
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Wha... What is that thing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I'm studied on my history...[N]
That's a dragon.[A] And not the[N]
tamed wyvern kind of dragon.[A][N]
That's a dragon that's lost to history.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's lost to history, how did[N]
it end up here, in front of us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I-I... I don't know! This has[N]
never happened before![A][N]
It looks dangerous... But we've[N]
got no choice.[A] We have to stop[N]
it from getting outside.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How will we even know if we're[N]
hurting it?[A] It looks[N]
absolutely impenetrable![A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's like our modern wyverns,[N]
it's not as durable as it looks.[A][N]
Worst case, one of the chests here might[N]
have some kind of dragon-killer.[A][N]
I'm certain that with its power,[A][N]
as well as your power that bested[N]
the trial, we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I hope you're right...[A][N]
Everyone! We must bring[N]
an end to this threat![A][N][OpenMidRight]
...It seems a bit... stunned by[N]
its surroundings.[A] Make use of this[N]
time before it collects itself![A][X]

##C12HeChargeth
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
The dragon's preparing to move![A][N]
If you can't handle it, fall back now![A][X]
