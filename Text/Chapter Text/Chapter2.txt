[OpenMidLeft][LoadJohan][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
...Sir Desmond and I shall be back[N]
before sundown![A] Mark my words-[N]
our duel shall be-[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's great, Stefan.[N]
But you know I'll win anyway.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha! We'll see.[N]
Farewell.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Now then. Where was I?[N]
Upkeep it is, I suppose.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
...[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
...[A][N][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
...And that's that. What else[N]
to attend to...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1]Johan! We have a problem![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the issue?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Our scouts reported an unconfirmed army[N]
headed this way.[A] Currently, we have[N]
reason to believe it's the Yg'strans![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's... a surprise.[A][N]
Hm... Rally whatever troops we have here[N]
to mount a defensive position.[A][N]
Desmond and Stefan left not too long ago.[N]
If they return, we'll be greatly advantaged.[A][N]
What else... Have our mages launch the[N]
emergency signal.[A] ...We'll pray the capital[N]
takes notice. That's our only hope.[A][X]

##Ch2_Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadKenneth][OpenFarRight][LoadNatasia][OpenLeft]
Whew... We're almost...[N]
there...[A][N][MoveLeft]
...How are there so many[N]
of them already?[A][N]
[OpenRight]So... that's their move.[N]
Target the isolated state.[A][N]
They probably believed Aercolyn to be[N]
less defended as a Dalstian entrypoint.[A][N]
The real question is why, and why now?[A][N]
As far as I knew, negotiations had been[N]
progressing smoothly.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Well, that doesn't mean anything now![N]
What matters is that we're under attack![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]This might sound mad, but I believe our best[N]
plan is to get on the offensive.[A][N]
The Yg'strans may very well underestimate us,[N]
and it'll get harder the longer we wait.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Well, you didn't lie.[N]
That's beyond mad.[A][N]
This is a real army we're dealing with![A][N]
[OpenLeft]...We do have an element of surprise...[A][N]
And more importantly... I feel this sense[N]
of duty.[A] I can't leave the soldiers here[N]
waiting for a savior that will never come.[A][N]
We have to be their saviors.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Well said! I'm always down[N]
to crush some dastards.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]I believe we're in agreement here.[A][N]
[OpenRight]...Fine. I've come this far.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]Thank you, my friends.[N]
I know we'll win.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Sir Desmond! There they are![A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadDesmond][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Whew... Good... Good eye...[N]
Stefan...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Are you alright, sir?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Never... been... better...[N]
Just... out of... breath...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You did a swell job keeping up[N]
with my horse, at least.[A][N]
Why didn't you bring yours[N]
for training, anyway?[A][A]
[OpenMidLeft]A true knight...[N]
must never get rusty.[A][N]
I felt it best to practice dismounted[N]
manuevers every once in a while.[A][N]
Of course, today just had to be[N]
the day Yg'stra made their move.[A][N]
In any case, I'm alright to stay[N]
on foot.[A] You're young and inexperienced.[N]
You need every advantage you can get.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm honored, sir! But I'll also[N]
prove you wrong-[A] I may be young,[N]
but I can fight with the best of them![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's see how you handle this, then.[A][N]
The Yg'strans are calling our name, and I[N]
don't intend to leave them unanswered.[A][X]

##C2Spooky
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBaddie3][OpenMidRight][LoadBrentson]
...What do you want?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...You know what we desire.[N]
Are the barracks secured?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]For now. The lordling's fighting[N]
tooth and nail to reverse that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...I suppose that will have to do.[A][N]
Gentlemen! Initiate the plan![N]
Capture all within the fort![A][X]

##C2Spooky2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
You're coming with us,[N]
Aercolynese scum![A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier1][OpenFarRight][LoadJohan]
Wait... How did they...[N]
This... shouldn't be...[A][N]
[OpenRight]Sir Johan! We shall prevail![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Let's hope you're right.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]They said they want you alive...[N]
But I can still rough you up![A][N]
Face it, you're no match for our might.[N]
Especially with this power...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Wha-[A][X]

##C2BrentsonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
Apologies, but these are[N]
our barracks now.[A][N]
You think you can take them?[N]
Good luck, friend.[A][X]

##C2BrentsonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
...Impressive...[N]
But this... isn't the end...[A][N]
There's more of us...[N]
where that... came from...[A][X]

##C2VillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Those filthy Yg'strans...[N]
Their armor's hard as steel![A][N]
I mean, it's made of steel, so[N]
I guess that's to be expected...[A][N]
WHATEVER! Look, I used to be a carpenter.[A][N]
This old hammer of mine should crack[N]
those cans right open.[A][X]

##C2JohanT2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft]
Sir Johan! How shall we proceed?[N]
The enemy has us cornered.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I think I hear some activity outside.[N]
...It sounds like... Blair.[A][N]
Our call has been answered.[N]
All we must do now is survive.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...You're right. It'll be fine...[N]
Thank you for everything, sir.[A][X]
