##Z2Note
The forts in the upper middle of the[N]
map are devices to control the river.[A][N]
Wait on the east fort to unleash[N]
water,[A] then on the west fort to[N]
block flow and open an escape route.[A][N]
Be careful - enemies will emerge[N]
once the path is open,[A][N]
including a flying boss with valuable[N]
treasure from the southern mountains.[A][X]

##_Z2Escape
Divert river[N]
and escape.[X]

##Z2Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadAlexis][OpenRight]
How far out do you estimate[N]
us to be?[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's hard to say. The terrain's[N]
not the easiest to manage,[A][N]
especially in this armor.[A][N]
It's well worth the[N]
protection, of course.[A][N]
But it's still a hassle.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Not to mention, we've gotta find[N]
another way around the river![A][N][OpenRight]
Rivers[...] I can tell they're[N]
an issue around here.[A][N]
How'd you manage them on the way[N]
TO Holanis?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sailed down them. Let the[N]
current carry us.[A][N]
[...]We might've lost our[N]
raft in some rapids.[A][N]
But that's the price we pay.[N]
Now we're on foot.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadLeila]
[...]We've got danger up ahead.[N]
Bandits. And Yg'strans.[A][N]
Seems they're guarding some[N]
kind of contraption by the river.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I wonder[...] I've heard of[N]
new devices.[A][N]
Devices that can alter the flow[N]
of an entire river.[A][N][OpenRight]
I see what you're saying, Hyperius[...][N]
We could use one to get through here.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Whatever you decide, we'd better move.[N]
I'm pretty sure someone saw me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Very well. All troops, prepare[N]
for orders! [...]Your highness?[A][N][OpenRight]
Certainly. Move to break through[N]
to the northwest passage![A][X]

##Z2Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadDamien][OpenFarLeft][LoadZacharias][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadHyperius][OpenLeft]
Did everyone make it through?[A][N][OpenRight]
I believe so. Thank you for your[N]
assistance, strangers.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's nothing at all. If I may[N]
ask, who are you, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If I may-[A][N][OpenRight]
It is alright, Hyperius.[N]
They helped us out.[A][N]
The least they deserve is[N]
to know who we are.[A][N]
I am Ezekiel Johanes Courian.[N]
[...]You can just call me Zeke.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Aren't you dead?[A][N][OpenRight]
It's a[...] long story.[A][N][OpenLeft]
This could be big. Real big[...][A][N]
If either of us cared for the[N]
war, that is.[A][N]
But really, we just wander.[N]
Hunt. The like.[A][N]
On occasion, grill it up[N]
with Uncle Toby.[A][N]
Point is, war's not our life.[A][N][OpenRight]
I see. You did well, today.[N]
Would you care to stick with us?[A][N][OpenLeft]
I wouldn't mind. What about[N]
you, Zach?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Sure. It's something to do.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's settled, then.[N]
Let's press onward.[A][N]
I believe we're starting to[N]
near Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Very well. Onwards.[A][X]

##Z2RecruitmentText
[OpenLeft][LoadDamien][OpenFarLeft][LoadZacharias]
[...]Damien.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Yup. I see them, Zach. Seems[N]
those strangers are in a bind.[A][N]
How's about we spread some[N]
good deeds, bud?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Fine by me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alrighty, then![A][N]
HEY! FELLAS![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon? Who would you be?[A][N][OpenLeft]
The name's Damien. This[N]
guy here is Zacharias.[A][N]
We're just wanderin' around.[N]
You seem like you need a hand.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's not too much trouble[...][N]
That would be brilliant.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Say no more! You ready, Zach?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Yup.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't get too excited, now.[N]
Wouldn't want to blow them away.[A][N]
Anyway! I presume you're making for[N]
the river control devices.[A][N]
Make sure you trigger the EASTERN[N]
one first![A] You gotta give the water[N]
somewhere to go to block the western flow![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks for the advice![A][X]

##Z2WyvernsSpawnedText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
What in the[...] Is that[N]
thing[...] a wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That doesn't look like any wyverns[N]
I've read about[...][A][N]
It's too[...] large.[N]
And bloodthirsty.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We should probably make a break[N]
for it, your highness.[A][N]
Especially since I'm quite sure it'll[N]
cause enough fuss to draw a crowd.[A][N]
We can't afford to get surrounded[N]
at this point.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Everyone! Let's move![A][X]

##Z2VultureBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVulture]
This river's my post.[A][N]
They'll have my head if[N]
I don't kill ya.[A][N]
Sorry, but them's the breaks.[A][X]

##Z2VultureZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVulture]
You look important.[N]
I could get a fine ransom.[A][N]
Or I could just kill you here.[N]
Either one works for me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
You shall do nothing.[N]
I must strike you down.[A][X]

##Z2VultureDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVulture]
How[...] ironic[...][A][N]
The vulture[...] becomes[...][N]
the new[...] carrion[...][A][X]
