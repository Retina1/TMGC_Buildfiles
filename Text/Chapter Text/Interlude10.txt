Our only move, really[...] is waiting[N]
for them to come to us.[A][N][OpenRight]
Then we make our stand.[A][N]
We'll have watch posted constantly,[N]

And after that[...]?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Once we weather the assault,[N]

This is quite the castle[N]

Reminds me of the story of[N]
how I lost my arm.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How so? [...]Don't tell me you[N]
lost it here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] 'Twas a journey in[N]
a distant land.[A] I and some[N]
friends were hired for a job.[A][N]
An assassination, in particular.[A][N]
I was to assassinate, and the[N]
others to infiltrate.[A][N]
Sadly, our target was[...] wiser[N]
than our client let on.[A][N]
Quite the swordsman too.[A][N]
He fell in the end, but he took[N]
my arm with him.[A] I[...] had[N]
considered giving in there.[A][N]
Hanging up my blade.[A][N]
But I yearned for adventures.[N]
For new stories to tell.[A][N]
And with practice, I got back[N]
to my former skill.[A][N]
Perhaps even more.[A][N]
Plus, people underestimate me.[A][N]
Always a bit of a joy to show[N]
them a real surprise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did you say assassination?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've taken on some odd jobs[N]

me, it sounds like he fought another.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Truly, I'm a wretched father for[N]
letting them grow up like that.[A][N]
I've[...] let many people down.[N]
Them. Viridian. My country.[A][N]
[...]Something inside of me is[N]
irreparable.[A] And it breaks[N]
everyone I meet.[A][N]
[...]But something else inside of[N]
me refuses to stop.[A][N]
I'm convinced that[...] maybe even[N]
after everything I've done[...][A][N]
I can bring some good to the world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[...]What're you writing, there?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just preparing a speech.[A][N]
We're about to undertake[...][N]
Well, I won't sugarcoat it.[A][N]
An extremely dangerous battle.[N]
[...]I don't expect us all to survive.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Knowing that, I still have to[N]
drum up hope and morale in our men.[A][N]
It's[...] hard. Especially after[N]
saving everyone.[A] Telling them[N]
to go back into the field.[A][N]
A field that may very well[N]
claim their lives.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

I suppose it's not unlike[N]
what you face constantly.[A][N]

It's proof you're something[N]
special, milady.[A][N]
[...]I[...] ought to get back to[N]

caught up on simple words?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I'm glad someone as considerate[N]

##I10VladmirTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Might I ask something, Archbishop?[N]
[...]Is it okay for you to be here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[...] You're concerned about Opistia's[N]
involvement in Dalstian affairs.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dalst and Opistia have long been allies.[N]
Wouldn't interceding cause[...] problems?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps it would. But I'd say there'd[N]
be larger problems letting this slide.[A][N]
Turning a blind eye to injustices is[N]
hardly becoming of His followers.[A][N]
And it is the duty of the fellow man[N]
to set a sinner upon the right track.[A][N]
[...]To look at it from a pragmatic lens,[N]
it will only be an issue if you fail.[A][N]
And I have witnessed your ability.[N]
I have faith in you. In us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hardly what I imagined you saying.[N]
But I appreciate it nonetheless.[A][N]
[...]By the way, I don't remember if I[N]
ever thanked you for Yg'stra.[A][N]
So[...] thanks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If anything, you deserve commendation.[N]
But let's not get lost in praise.[A][N]
There's much to prepare. I shall[N]
write back to Opistia.[A][N]
They deserve to know what transpires.[A][N]
May He guide your preparations well.[A][X]
