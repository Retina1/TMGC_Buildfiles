[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] might be it, Fred.[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unlike me, to feel[N]
this afraid, I know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I admit[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The odds are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
not looking the best.[A][N]
But we've faced down the[N]
impossible many times before.[A][N]
And I believe in us.[N]
I believe in you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still. None of you deserve to[N]
put yourselves through this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We CHOOSE to fight with you.[A][N]
That's what I've done since[N]
we've met,[A] and what I'll do[N]
until the day I die.[A][N]
Whether that's today or in[N]
seventy years[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I shall stay by you forever.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it wrong of me to say[N]
I wish for nothing else?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not at all.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If we don't make it[N]
through today,[A][N]
I want you to know.[A][N]
You've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worth living for.[A][X]
