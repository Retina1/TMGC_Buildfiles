[OpenMidLeft][LoadIneubrenos][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu]
Hey, ashface![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you need of me,[N]
goofy-looking mortal?[A][N]
Are we not sparring?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Nice bow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I said nice bow.[N]
As in, that's a nice bow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're as unusual as you look.[A][N]
[...]But thanks.[A] Nobody's ever[N]
really complimented my bow.[A][N]
[...]Guess it's hard to when you're dead.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's why I made the wise[N]
choice to not die.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ha.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's funny about that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Nothing, I guess.[A][N]
You're just an amusing mortal.[N]
[...]It's been a boring eternity.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sorry to hear. Ennui's the worst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I think I know your game.[A][N]
You complimented my bow[N]
because you want it.[A][N]
Well, I won't give it to ya[N]
that easily.[A] But[...] You're[N]
amusing.[A] So, I've an idea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I had no ulterior motives.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, sure.[A][N]
Anyway, here's an old bow[N]
I've kept for eons.[A][N]
Had it back when I was mortal.[A][N]
I think some of my skill rubbed[N]
off on it.[A] Pick it up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Okay?[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
[...]Woah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]As predicted. You're now an[N]
inheritor of my skill.[A][N]
Hundreds of years of training with[N]
the bow, all in an instant.[A][N]
[...]Pretty sweet, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] fun.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That'll do for me.[A][N]
Now, child of man[...][N]
Let your new skills shine through![A][N]
Show me what you can do![A][X]

##C24LarondeRetreats
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
Oof[...] I'm sorry[...][N]
I'll meet you up ahead[...][A][N]
I can't stay[...] any longer[...][A][X]

##Ch24_LarondeAppears
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
[...]Easy, boy. Stay right over there.[N]
I don't want you getting hurt.[A][N]
If you think this is the place,[N]
I trust your instincts.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll see Archbishop[N]
Vladmir soon.[A][N]
[...]Just be ready to grab me[N]
if things get too dicey. Please.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungEthyl]
Greetings, Girard. What did[N]
you wish to see me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're of keener mind than I.[N]
Have a look at this.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
What in the[...] That's[...][N]
a lot of notes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The results of my trip to[N]
Holanis.[A] The life's work[N]
of Lord Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[...] you wish me to[N]
analyze them?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You pick up on things fast.[A][N]
See what's of worth within[N]
this pile.[A] Destroy the rest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Surely, if what I heard's[N]
accurate, this can't be all of it.[A][N]
Sinclair was a thorough man.[A][N]
This[...] isn't enough for him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why I'm making more than[N]
one trip.[A] [...]Say, would you[N]
mind coming along?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. That'll simplify[N]
matters greatly.[A][N]
[...]This is the best way to get[N]
back at him.[A][N]
Using what he did for the[N]
good of the Alliance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure is a way to look at it.[A][N]
[...]If we're done here, I'd better[N]
be off. Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What's this document on top, anyway?[N]
[OpenQuote]The Histories of Holanis[CloseQuote][...][A][N]

##C24IneubrenosDefeat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIneubrenos]
Oof[...] Well done, friend.[N]
My power is now yours.[A][N]
Use it to bring about[N]
the world you desire.[A][X]

##C24MasonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason]
Tremble before me, insurgents![A][N]
I am Mason, disciple[N]
of Lord Tarquin![A][N]
I[...] am[...] untouchable![A][X]

##C24MasonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason]
No[...] Please[...][A][N]
So much I[...] haven't[...][N]
done[...][A][N]
So many treasures[...][N]
not mine[...][A][X]

##C24MasonElcorianTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]Well, I must be off.[N]
I've much to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? You'd rather not watch[N]
the fireworks up close?[A][N]
See that traitor get what's[N]
coming to her?[A][N]
See Lord Tarquin avenged?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, whatever the case, I do[N]
quite appreciate this relic.[A][N]
With it, I shall soar through this[N]
darkness and break the traitors' ranks![A][N]
Those other creations shall do us[N]
much good too.[A] Almost makes one[N]
not need us real humans.[A][N]
Still, that blade you carry[...][A][N]
I can[...] feel it.[A][N]
The power it holds.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]It is but[...] a ceremonial[N]
implement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, and I'm the king of Holanis.[A][N]
[...]I'm just saying. No reason to act[N]
like you're above all this.[A][N]
I've heard of your deeds. How your[N]
hands will never again be clean.[A][N]
[...]And I'd embrace that.[A][N]
But, hey. I'm not Girard's number one.[N]
I just know my place in the world.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Farewell. And good luck.[A][N]
Perform well, and more relics[N]
may be in your future.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sir, yes, sir.[A][X]

##C24_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
We're back in the Lowlands[...][A][N]
I could go never seeing them[N]
for the rest of my life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I couldn't agree more.[A][N]
[...]Can't help but notice that[N]
there's been no bandit attacks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps Tarquin drove them off[N]
in the process of marching on us.[A][N]
Though[...] That might mean[...][A][X]

##C24_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Reinforcements? He[...] truly wasn't[N]
holding back.[A][N]
But we can't afford to be[N]
caught up in them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Especially since we don't know[N]
how many survived the last battle.[A][N]
If we're not careful, stragglers[N]
could catch up with us.[A][N]
Being pincered in this darkness[N]
could easily spell the end for us.[A][N]
I say our best move is to get out[N]
of here as quickly as possible,[A][N]
before that could ever become an issue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Everyone! Head west![N]
Regroup once we're beyond the dark![A][X]
