##Epilogue_FreddricMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][CloseEyes]
[...]Here, I begin to try and pick[N]
up the pieces.[A] Make something of[N]
what we fought for all these years.[A][N]
[...]I will[...] never be able to live[N]
up to you[...] Up to us.[A][N]
[...]But I still must try.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Milady. Pardon me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I know you'd be[N]
making them proud.[A][N]
No matter what you do.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][CloseEyes]I[...] I know.[A][N]
[...]I'll[...] keep their dream alive[N]
as long as I live.[A][N]
[...]Farewell, milady. Thank you[N]
for guiding us.[A][X]

##Epilogue_RiftMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
No more arenas for me. Gonna stay[N]
with what's left of the mercs.[A][N]
It's[...] Well, I can't even say[N]
it's more stable a job.[A][N]
Either way, I face death on the[N]
daily.[A] And the arena's truly[N]
always there.[A][N]
But[...] Outside the arena, it[N]
feels like I can truly matter.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Either way, you've been an[N]
important ally of us all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's an honor to hear. Truly.[A][N]
But honor doesn't pay for a[N]
place to sleep.[A][N]
And so, the cycle begins anew.[N]
[...]See you around.[A][X]

##Epilogue_CallumMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
The war's over and done, but there's[N]
still much fighting to be done.[A][N]
And for that, I am so glad.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'll stay with the remnants[N]
of the mercenaries, then?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. If you're gonna raise hell,[N]
you gotta do it with good folks.[A][N]
I've not forgotten the incompetency[N]
of Yg'stra's [OpenQuote]finest.[CloseQuote][A][N]
You bet I'm stickin' with the[N]
people who respect me.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
That said, I respect you. So if[N]
everyone else dies,[A] perhaps[N]
I'll come see if you have a job.[A][N]
[...]Until then.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ManfredMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadManfred]
Well, milady. Not much to say.[N]
I'll remain with the mercenaries.[A][N]
There's still much to uncover of[N]
the world,[A] and traveling with[N]
them's a fair way to find it.[A][N]
[...]Not really one for long and[N]
formal goodbyes, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thanks for your service, and[N]
good luck with your studies.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course. [...]Farewell, then.[A][N]
We'll likely never again meet.[N]
So enjoy my company now.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Good day, then.[A][X]

##Epilogue_WilhelmMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm]
Still alive, I guess.[N]
Bit of a shocker.[A][N]
Not a bad shocker, mind.[A][N]
But I felt I'd be a bit[N]
more expendable here.[A][N]
[...]Guess I'll stick with[N]
what's left of the mercs.[A][N]
I'm sure we'll find some[N]
new blood.[A] And merc work[N]
still beats the debtors.[A][N]
[...]Don't know if I'll never[N]
know real peace again.[A][N]
[...]But I'll get by.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Best of luck to you, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My luck's gotten me nowhere.[A][N]
But I appreciate the sentiment.[N]
[...]Good day.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ArgentMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent]
My work will never be done.[A][N]
Until I perish, I will continue[N]
to fight in Viridian's memory.[A][N]
[...]For once in my life, I truly have[N]
no doubts where I'm meant to be.[A][N]
Fighting for who I can where I can.[N]
[...]It's a simple purpose,[A] but no[N]
less valuable than many others.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I wish you well, Argent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And I wish well upon all who[N]
come next.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]For everyone[N]
who's gotten me this far,[A][N]
I swear to make you proud.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ClarqueMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[...]My work is[...] done.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]And yet[...] It all still[N]
feels purposeless.[A][N]
[...]There still has to be[N]
something for me out there.[A][N]
Maybe it'll take all my life[N]
to find it,[A] but[...][N]
I'll find a purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Best of luck, Clarque.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Best of luck to you.[A][N]
Remember what this victory[N]
cost. Cherish this peace.[A][N]
And let everything that brought[N]
us together mean something.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ValeriaMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadValeria][CloseEyes]
[...]This[...] was the last place[N]
I saw them.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] do wish to thank you.[A][N]
For fighting for what they[N]
all believed in.[A][N]
[...]I must find my family now.[N]
Farewell, young lady.[A][X]

##Epilogue_OlsenMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadOlsen][ToggleSmile]
Well, that was easy.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Bit too easy, frankly.[N]
Maybe I'm too good.[A][N]
[...]Maybe I need another[N]
hobby. Spice up my life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure something'll come to[N]
you, Ser Duke-Duchess.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
So true![A] The world's my oyster.[A][N]
[...]Hm[...] Oyster[...] Seafood[...][A][N]
[...]You've already got the ol'[N]
gears turning, Lady Blair.[A][N]
I don't know what I'll be doing[N]
when we meet again,[A] but I do[N]
truly hope we do.[A][X]

##Epilogue_KyrieMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKyrie]
It's been enlightening, fighting[N]
alongside so many unique styles.[A][N]
And yet, I am not quite content.[N]
Thus, I shall take my leave.[A][N]
There are many things to see.[N]
Many stories for me to create.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You weren't around long, but you[N]
were a brilliant ally all the same.[A][N]
Safe travels, Kyrie.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, young lady.[A][ToggleSmile] Though, I hope[N]
they're not completely safe.[A][N]
I'll gladly take a bit of excitement.[N]
Something keeping me on my toes.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ManfredWilhelmMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred]
Once more unto this life,[N]
old friend.[A] Have you[N]
finally grown weary?[A][N][OpenRight]
I've been weary for ages.[A][N]
But I can't show it around[N]
you. [...]Wait. Crap.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm the one guy alive who[N]
can make you aspire.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I like that feeling.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm sure you do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You two're resuming your[N]
mercenary ways, then?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yup. Guess you can call on[N]
what's left of our group.[A][N]
Between the debts and Manfred[N]
here, I'm in no rush to settle.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I've got to keep Wilhelm[N]
here alive.[A] It's not easy.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hey, I try.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Then do please try harder.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]For you, anything.[A][X]

##Epilogue_LeilaWilhelmMercenaries
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadLeila][OpenRight]
You sure you're up for this life?[N]
It's a hell of a time.[A][N]
I speak from[...] lots of experience.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll be more than fine. Worst case,[N]
I'm the one on the pegasus.[A][N]
Running's easy.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]Don't worry.[N]
I'd make sure to grab you.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm truly glad we're at the point in our[N]
relationship where I'm not left for dead.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Perhaps I'd make you beg for it.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Ah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You two look like you've got[N]
your plans figured out.[A][N][OpenRight]
Less a plan, milady, and more just[...][N]
Winging it. As I always have.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You got me by winging it.[A][N]
How hard can the rest of[N]
your life truly be?[A][N][OpenRight]
Suppose there's only one[N]
way to find that out.[A][N]
[...]Godspeed, milady.[A][X]
