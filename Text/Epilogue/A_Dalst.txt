##Epilogue_NatasiaDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
Welp, guess I'm headed back[N]
home now.[A] You'd better[N]
visit sometime.[A][N]
Never knew how lonely I'd[N]
get without ya.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Natasia.[A][N]
Things'll get busy for sure,[N]
but I'll make time for you.[A][N]
You're also always welcome[N]
to come to Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Appreciate it. I'd probably[N]
feel all outta place,[A][N]
but[...][A][ToggleSmile] Heh. Maybe that[N]
isn't so bad, either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're definitely unmistakable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And I wouldn't change that[N]
for the whole world, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_SamDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
Ah, Blair! I'll be returning[N]
to Barford.[A] It's[...] the least[N]
I can do for my brother.[A][N]
I might be[...] the most capable[N]
to inherit it now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've grown, Sam.[A][N]
I know you'll lead[N]
Barford to greatness.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I truly hope I can.[A][N]
It's[...] not been easy,[N]
getting this far.[A][N]
But I've made it.[N]
And I won't stop.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Thank you for everything.[A][X]

##Epilogue_SamEmileDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadSam][OpenFarRight][LoadEmile][OpenRight]
We'll be returning to Barford[N]
together, Blair.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[...] can never make right for[N]
what Elcorian did.[A][N]
But I can try.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You don't have to at all, Emile.[N]
None of his doing was your doing.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If[...] If you insist.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll[...] I'll need you at your[N]
finest to help run Barford.[A][N]
You can't let yourself get torn[N]
up over what you can't change.[A][N]
That's[...] what you taught me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I'll try.[A][CloseEyes] It won't be easy[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
But it will be easier with you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you both for all[N]
you've done for me.[A][N][OpenRight]
We[...] should thank you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Good luck wherever you[N]
find yourself, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_EmileDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
[...]I shall stay here.[A][N]
Maybe I can try to make[N]
something good of[...] this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't push yourself too[N]
hard, Emile.[A][N]
None of their choices are[N]
your fault.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] still can't help but feel[N]
responsible in some way.[A][N][CloseEyes]
That's always been a weakness[N]
of mine, I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'll make something[N]
better of it. I'm sure.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] glad you've faith in me.[N]
I just hope it's not misplaced.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JosefDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
My work's not done yet.[A][N]
I've gotta be the backbone[N]
of Dalst's might now.[A][N]
[...]Well, at least until we can[N]
replace all those who fell.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I suppose that's only natural[N]
in this kind of conflict.[A][N]
Dalst's arguably weaker than[N]
it's ever been.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't sweat it, milady.[A][N]
I'll pull the weight of[N]
hundreds if need be.[A][N]
We'll be back to what we[N]
were in no time.[A][N]
[...]Plus, I'm pretty sure peace[N]
is gonna last for a good bit.[A][N]
Nobody wants another war.[N]
We want stability.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]You're very correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I said. Don't worry about it.[N]
We'll rebuild it all. Better.[A][X]

##Epilogue_GaylordDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadGaylord]
Well, milady. I reckon I gotta[N]
get back to Barford soon.[A][N]
My nice warm bed's callin'.[N]
I'll be sure to see ya around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Take care of yourself, Gaylord.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I always do, milady. Good naps,[N]
good faith, good people[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
I got the most good around.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ElizaDirkDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
What about the two of you?[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, we don't have much[N]
of a real plan yet.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I was thinking, brother[...][N]
We could stay in Aercolyn?[A][N]
Blair's real nice, it's a safe[N]
city[...][A] I[...] I'm tired of[N]
being a mercenary.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]That[...] sounds nice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You two are always welcome.[A][N][OpenRight]
Appreciate it. Truly.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I'm[...] I'm alive.[N]
We're alive.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We[...] We are, brother.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ElizaDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
[...]Lady Blair? If[...] If I may[...][A][N]
Could[...] I come back to Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Eliza.[N]
You're always welcome.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Th-Thank you. I[...] There's a scary[N]
future ahead of me.[A][N]
It's finally hit me that[...][N]
That he's really gone.[A][N]
But I'll[...] I'll find a way.[N]
To be alright.[A][X]

##Epilogue_DirkDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
[...]It's[...] It's over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[...] You don't need[N]
to worry for me.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thank you for everything.[A][X]

##Epilogue_AddingtonDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAddington][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, right! Addington[...][N]
You little[...] thing.[A][N]
I[...] I think I know[N]
just what to do with you.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Yeah. Addington von[N]
Arbordia's got a nice ring.[A][X]

##Epilogue_KennethDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...]I'm still somewhat amazed.[N]
We[...] We really did it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you're alright with taking[N]
the reins of Dalst?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Had you wished to,[N]
you'd be well within your right.[A][N]
But this is a position I'm more[N]
than ready to rise to.[A][N]
It won't be an easy road,[A][N]
but it'll be one we tread far[N]
better than Arbordia.[A][N]
[...]Whatever you wish from[N]
here, I'll support you.[A][N]
I understand wanting to wash[N]
your hands of all of this.[A][N]
At the end of the day, more[N]
territory is more territory.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad to have that option.[N]
[...]You'll do great, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I always have.[A][X]

##Epilogue_BlairDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]It's still hard to believe.[A][N]
To think, from where I started.[N]
Poised to rule all of Dalst.[A][N]
It won't be easy, but when[N]
has that stopped us?[A][N]
[...]Let's hope I'm up to it.[A][X]

##Epilogue_VladmirDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir][OpenMidLeft]
Archbishop. I have a[...][N]
A request, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Opistia's long had close[N]
ties with Dalst.[A][N]
And I[...] I don't believe I wish[N]
to take upon these remnants.[A][N]
Until a noble house rises to[N]
govern the Alliance[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I believe I see what you ask.[A][N]
Opistia shall establish a[N]
temporary government here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I truly appreciate it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But of course. It would be wrong[N]
to force all this upon you.[A][N]
[...]I suppose much preparation[N]
will be in order, then.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ZekeDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
Zeke. I have a[...][N]
A request, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it, Blair?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Elba Cor's clearly as good an ally[N]
as the new Dalst will ever have.[A][N]
And I[...] I don't believe I wish[N]
to take upon these remnants.[A][N]
Until a noble house rises to[N]
govern the Alliance[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I understand.[A][N]
Elba Cor will maintain a peace[N]
until the nobility reforms.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I truly appreciate it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]There's truly no rest for us.[A][N]
But after everything, we at least[N]
get to choose our own paths.[A][X]

##Epilogue_HilbertDalst
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Don't forget me, Mister Kenneth![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You truly wish to stay[N]
here, Hilbert?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course! There's still[N]
so much for me to learn![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, then. It won't be easy,[N]
but if you're up to it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, mister! Together,[N]
we'll make justice prevail![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I suppose we finally shall.[A][X]
