...Well. What do you want?[N]
Come to laugh in a sinner's face?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I beg your pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't give me that. I know your type.[N]
...I've robbed your type blind.[A][N]
You think you're high and mighty[N]
for servin' some king.[A][N]
That you have some sort of moral[N]
authority from which to judge me.[A][N]
Well, I'm an irredeemable wretch![N]
What will you do about it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...That's... not quite[N]
what I came for.[A][N]
I just thought you an appropriate[N]
partner to train with,[A] given[N]
how swift we are.[A][N]
But do you really think all[N]
of us are like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you serve someone higher than yourself,[N]
you're betraying human nature.[A][N]
And in the name of what, may I ask?[A][N]
I may be scum, but at least[N]
I serve nobody but myself.[A][N]
At least I'm not perpetuating[N]
society's lies.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Would it be remiss to mention[N]
that you're serving this army?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And now I'm being made out as a[N]
god damned hypocrite.[A][N]
...I mean, I AM one, but the whole[N]
point of being one is NOT admitting it![A][N]
...I hope you're happy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
...What did I just listen to?[A][N]
He's wrong, anyway. Our king is a just man.[N]
Serving him is a brilliant purpose.[A][X]
