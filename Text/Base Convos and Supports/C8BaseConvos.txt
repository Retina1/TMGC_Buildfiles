You're familiar with fightin' in[N]
the dark, right, lassie?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yup! Fought off some[N]
Mevionese.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Good, good. Won't haf'ta start[N]
at the beginnin'.[A] The big difference[N]
with the Loile bandits is their traps.[A][N]
You might've seen torches before,[N]
and them Loiles have torches too.[A][N]
But think about this-[A] they live in[N]
this ashen darkness all the time.[A][N]
What purpose might a torch serve them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...I think I get it. If we light[N]
a torch,[A] that tells them they've[N]
got bad company.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ye pick up quickly![A][N]
Be careful if you light any torches,[N]
as that may signal our foes.[A][N]
Course, if you can handle it, you may[N]
want to fight some more baddies![A][N]
Worst case, I'll be out there wit' ya,[N]
so victory is basically assured.[A][X]

Lady Blair! A moment, if you will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No need for formalities, Emile.[N]
Especially since you're older than me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Of course. Anyway, it's been a while[N]
since our last session.[A] Have the[N]
techniques I taught you served you well?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Quite, I'd say. Especially since I've[N]
been in a few more fights than I'd hoped.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's just the way it is, I guess.[A][N]
At least spellcasting is an art valued[N]
both in peace and conflict.[A][N]
The skills you learn on the battlefield[N]
serve you elsewhere too, I'd hope.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anyway, how's your research been?[A][N]
Besides those recent readings, hadn't[N]
you been studying staves?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yup! There's still so many things we don't[N]
quite know about them,[A] and it's simply[N]
marvelous to dissect what makes them work.[A][N]
I had been working with Elcorian on a[N]
prototype that we called [OpenQuote]Arbitrate.[CloseQuote][A][N]
Imagine a Silence staff, but it can silence[N]
a whole room in an instant.[A][N]
...Last I was there, we were still far[N]
from something that truly worked,[A][N]
but that's the inventor's process.[A][N]
...Sorry if I started rambling there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why would that be an issue? You're just[N]
talking about your passion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Ha. I guess you're right.[N]
Always good to talk to you, Blair.[A][X]
