[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it now, Lazarus?[N]
You're hardly fit to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I had come to apologize.[N]
I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] several regrets.[A][N]
And I wish to fight for Yg'stra again.[N]
On that note, where is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Arkhinal? It has been sealed away.[N]
I'm not at liberty to disclose where.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I wouldn't even if I could.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if you're sincere about your[N]
desire to fight again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And you truly understand the error[N]
of your ways[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] There may be[N]
a soldier's path ahead for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you for this chance.[A][N]
But, you do have one thing wrong.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And what would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My path[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is not one of a soldier.[A][N]
It is one[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] of a conqueror.[N]
Of a living god.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I believe this is where we part ways.[A][X]

##C14ValdenDies
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
Gah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] traitor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
What, you call me a traitor? For what?[N]
For following my own path?[A][N]
For seeking glory? Is that not what[N]
everyone's here for? Glory and power?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is so much[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
never understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] You are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
truly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] weak[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
Pah! Why do I listen to the[N]
ramblings of a dead man?[A][N][MoveRight]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Urgh![A][X]

##C14LazarusMoment
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
At last[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How glorious.[A][N]
Just gotta think of a way to explain[N]
this to the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] And then[N]
the world shall be mine.[A][N]
Perhaps I'd be able to take him[N]
on if I had Arkhinal,[A] but that bastard[N]
just had to get in my way one last time.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14OpenDeadValden
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the Dalstians did you in, Valden.[N]
Damn. I was hoping to do that myself.[A][N]
Alas. At least it makes my life all[N]
the simpler.[A] I'd say I feel bad,[N]
but I don't. At all.[A][N]
You were weak, Valden.[N]
That's why you died.[A][N]
As for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Need I say more?[A][N]
I'm the strongest man in this[N]
entire fucking empire![A][N]
With the emperor as he is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's nobody better suited[N]
to take this throne than I.[A][N][Event]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest. How glorious.[A][N]
Of course, that bastard just had to[N]
get in my way one last time.[A][N]
Hid Arkhinal away and took its[N]
location to the grave. Alas.[A][N]
Maybe I'll scour the palace for it[N]
later, and take all that's mine.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14AthenaCharleyJoin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And here we are.[A][N]
I'd say this is above my pay grade,[N]
but, hey. At least it's exciting.[A][N]
Moreso than border-guarding.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can let go of me now.[N]
We're here.[A][N][Event][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Apologies. Never've been the[N]
most[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comfortable flier.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I may ask, why[N]
did you want to come along?[A][N]
Surely, you can do more personally[N]
fulfilling things than war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For a long time, I've felt like I've[N]
wandered without a purpose.[A][N]
This might be what I've been looking[N]
for all this time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. Enough talking. The lady's[N]
party should be nearby.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. It's all up to us.[A][X]


##C14SwitchHint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier4]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I standing here, again?[A][N]
Commander Valden told me sternly to[N]
not move from this spot,[A][N]
lest the enemy enable this switch that[N]
makes the throne sink into the floor.[A][N]
But why wouldn't he want that?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That just sounds cool.[A][N]
Alas. I'm not one to defy him.[N]
Hopefully he's doing alright.[A][X]

##C14Spooky
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenFarFarRight][LoadElcorian]
Are you sure this is quite[N]
alright, Girard?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Relax. Nobody will see us from[N]
here, and even if someone does[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, we're more than capable of[N]
fending them off.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
So, it appears this war is coming[N]
to an end. I expected nothing less.[A][N]
In any case, the plan must keep[N]
moving forward.[A] For the sake[N]
of the future.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
No need to be so apprehensive.[A][N]
Come, now. We ought to be off[N]
back to our homeland.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Don't worry about it, friend.[A][X]

##nothroneha
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
What the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Did the throne just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
disappear from under me?[A][N]
What sorcery is this!?[N]
Who built that into the palace?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter.[A][N]
If those Dalstians think they can[N]
take me down with their tricks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, I'll prove them dead wrong.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You.[A][N]
Treasure your last[N]
living moments.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
What, too scared to speak?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hardly.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You are going to suffer[N]
for all that you've done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
You think you can[N]
kill me?[A] Hah![N]
Put on a good show, then.[A][X]

##C14LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I am the strongest[N]
man in Yg'stra![A][N]
If you wish to throw your[N]
life away, so be it.[A][X]

##C14LazarusDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] DAMN IT![N]
After EVERYTHING![A][N]
I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the GOD[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
of this world[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Without me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you[N]
all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are NOTHING![A][N]
Nothing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
