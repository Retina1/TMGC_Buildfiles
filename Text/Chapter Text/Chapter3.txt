##Ch3_Sam_Joins
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
Please, wait up![N]
You're Lady Blair, correct?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's me![N]
...Who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, right. My name is Sam.[A][N]
I'm... recently recruited into[N]
the Dalstian army.[A][N]
They felt you'd need backup, so[N]
they sent me and some other guy.[A][N]
...Where is he, anyway?[A][N]
You'd think a man in heavy armor[N]
wouldn't beat an agile young woman...[A][N]
Anyway, I'm good with a bow.[N]
Relatively speaking.[A] I just picked[N]
it up, but I'm already skilled, I think.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Glad to have you here![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, right! One more quick thing.[A][N]
According to some Dalstian intelligence,[N]
there's some ballistae here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm... They'll easily outrange us,[A][N]
and I'd imagine they have enough ammunition[N]
to never run out before we die...[A][N]
We'll have to prioritize them.[N]
Thanks for the tip, Sam![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly! Just... don't leave[N]
me behind, please.[A][X]

##Ch3_Josef_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Ah! Would you happen to be Lady Blair?[N]
The name's Josef. Pleasure to mmet you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume you're the other soldier[N]
Dalst sent? I've already met Sam.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Sam. What a character.[N]
Young, but she's got spirit.[A][N]
Of course, I just had to rush ahead.[A][N]
After all, if there's anyone who can hold[N]
those Yg'strans off, it's me.[A][N]
Try as they may, they'll never breach[N]
my rock-solid armor![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see, I see...[N]
But what if I did this?[A][MoveMidLeft][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Eeep![A][N]
...Milady, I ask you not joke like that.[N]
Magic is no laughing matter.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Apologies.[A][N]
...Though, that was pretty funny.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]If you consider doing that again...[N]
I'll... uh...[A][N]
...please don't do that.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Hello there! Wanna play with me?[A][N]
...No? Aw, shucks![N]
Who'll I play with now?[A][N]
Ever since everyone's gone off to war,[N]
it's been lonely around here...[A][N]
You know what I think?[N]
I think war is stupid![A][N]
...Sorry I said a bad word.[A][N]
Take this as an apology, and maybe[N]
come play with me later, please?[A][X]
