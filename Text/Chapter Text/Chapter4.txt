Oy! What's all this ruckus?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Ruckus? Do you mean this battle?[A][N]
Oh... I see we're nearing your church.[N]
Sorry about that![A] We'll try and keep[N]
any fighting far away from sacred grounds.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's hardly an issue-[A][N]
I was just glum because nobody called[N]
me over to beat up these dolts![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You... WANT to fight Mevion?[N]
Isn't this church... in Mevion?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's all very hazy. In any case,[N]
I can want to knock 'em all around anyway![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's... great. However, fighting isn't[N]
our priority.[A] We're actually also on[N]
the run from Yg'stra, as it happens.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Dalstians fleeing into Mevion...[N]
Quite the bold move, I'd say![A][N]
Luckily, if you head futher west, the[N]
anti-Dalstian sentiment weakens.[A][N]
Hell, by the time you reach our capital,[N]
Kionius, you may find yourself accepted![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm glad to know that...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, damn me! Forgot to introduce myself.[N]
The name's Peggy.[A] Woman of the cloth.[N]
Or so they say. You know what?[A][N]
Your journey sounds rather interesting-[N]
I think I'll come along![A][N]
Don't worry- I've got a healing staff[N]
and a... not-healing staff.[A][N]
I can handle myself just fine.[A][X]

##C4StarqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarque]
Dalstians... My vengeance[N]
shall come to fruition![A][N]
I will kill you in the[N]
name of my brother, Marque![A][X]

##C4StarqueDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarque]
Grah... So this...[N]
is it...[A][N]
Dying... to bloody...[N]
Dalstians...[A][N]
Is this... how you...[N]
felt... brother...?[A][X]

##C4LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I am Lazarus.[A][N]
No point in wasting any[N]
words more on a corpse.[A][N]
Prepare to die![A][X]

##C4LazarusDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Urgh! How in the hell[N]
did you do that?[A][N]
...Don't think this is over.[A][N]
Next we meet, you will[N]
absolutely perish.[A][X]

##Ch4_Get_Moving
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I think I see the Yg'strans behind us.[N]
We should probably pick up the pace.[A][X]

##Ch4_Get_Out
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Is that... their commander[N]
behind us?[A] ...This isn't good[N]
at all.[A] We need to escape. Now.[A][X]

##Ch4_Lazarus_Arrives
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So... They're on the run.[N]
Their fear... Let it fuel us.[A][N]
They flee because they know they[N]
cannot win.[A] Our victory shall[N]
be absolute.[A][X]
