[OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Sir Desmond! There they are![A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadDesmond][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Whew... Good... Good eye...[N]
Stefan...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Are you alright, sir?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Never... been... better...[N]
Just... out of... breath...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You did a swell job keeping up[N]
with my horse, at least.[A][N]
Why didn't you bring yours[N]
for training, anyway?[A][A]
[OpenMidLeft]A true knight...[N]
must never get rusty.[A][N]
I felt it best to practice dismounted[N]
manuevers every once in a while.[A][N]
Of course, today just had to be[N]
the day Yg'stra made their move.[A][N]
In any case, I'm alright to stay[N]
on foot.[A] You're young and inexperienced.[N]
You need every advantage you can get.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm honored, sir! But I'll also[N]
prove you wrong-[A] I may be young,[N]
but I can fight with the best of them![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's see how you handle this, then.[A][N]
The Yg'strans are calling our name, and I[N]
don't intend to leave them unanswered.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBaddie3][OpenMidRight][LoadBrentson]
...What do you want?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...You know what we desire.[N]
Are the barracks secured?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]For now. The lordling's fighting[N]
tooth and nail to reverse that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...I suppose that will have to do.[A][N]
Gentlemen! Initiate the plan![N]
Capture all within the fort![A][X]

##C2Spooky2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
You're coming with us,[N]
Aercolynese scum![A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier1][OpenFarRight][LoadJohan]
Wait... How did they...[N]
This... shouldn't be...[A][N]
[OpenRight]Sir Johan! We shall prevail![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Let's hope you're right.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]They said they want you alive...[N]
But I can still rough you up![A][N]
Face it, you're no match for our might.[N]
Especially with this power...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Wha-[A]s[X]

##C2BrentsonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
Apologies, but these are[N]
our barracks now.[A][N]
You think you can take them?[N]
Good luck, friend.[A][X]

##C2BrentsonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
...Impressive...[N]
But this... isn't the end...[A][N]
There's more of us...[N]
where that... came from...[A][X]

##C2VillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Those filthy Yg'strans...[N]
Their armor's hard as steel![A][N]
I mean, it's made of steel, so[N]
I guess that's to be expected...[A][N]
WHATEVER! Look, I used to be a carpenter.[A][N]
This old hammer of mine should crack[N]
those cans right open.[A][X]
