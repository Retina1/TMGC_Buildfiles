##Prologue_Narration
Elba Cor calendar, year 590.[A][N]
The continent of Ulmaron.[A][N]
In legend, the world[N]
was once a formless thing,[A][N]
brought into being by[N]
the creator god Opistus.[A][N]
As man developed, so too[N]
did an array of great nations.[A][N]
Central among these is Dalst,[N]
a land of eternal progress.[A][N]
Advanced in science and society alike,[A][N]
the Dalstian Alliance comprises many noble[N]
provinces,[A] banded together for[N]
military and academic purposes alike.[A][N]
At the extreme northern edge[N]
of Dalst lies Aercolyn,[A][N]
a small territory which holds[N]
little influence currently,[A][N]
thanks to the disgraceful actions[N]
and subsequent exile of its lord.[A][N]
Since then, Blair, the heir to Aercolyn,[A][N]
has tirelessly worked towards restoration[N]
of the territory's influence,[A][N]
which has culminated in an invitation-[A][N]
one calling Blair to the[N]
Dalstian capital of Arbordia.[A][N]
Blair prepares to set off[N]
towards re-legitimizing Aercolyn.[A][N]
As humanity strides onward oblivious,[N]
the world is waking to a new era.[A][X]

##Ch1_Narration
The former Kingdom of Mevion.[A][N]
Since time immemorial, Mevion has[N]
been ruled by proud monarchies.[A][N]
12 years ago, everything changed,[A][N]
when the freshly crowned king[N]
raised taxes to oppressive levels.[A][N]
Almost overnight, a rebellion[N]
formed, and bloody civil war began.[A][N]
Eventually, the monarchy was overthrown,[N]
and a democratic-republic was formed,[A][N]
where man could elect representatives.[A][N]
Thus began the golden age of[N]
the Reborn Mevionese Republic.[A][N]
The nation maintains uneasy peace[N]
with Dalst,[A] as Dalstian nobility[N]
fears possible rebellion at home.[A][N]
Considering all of this,[A] Blair is tasked[N]
with investigating the Mevionese border,[A][N]
following rumors of violence.[A][X]

##Ch2_Narration
The Empire of Yg'stra.[N]
A rugged civilization.[A][N]
Rather than traditional succession[N]
through bloodlines,[A] Yg'stran rulers[N]
are decided through strength.[A][N]
Their culture embodies this philosophy,[N]
and most Yg'strans serve their army.[A][N]
Despite this, Yg'stra was never seen as[N]
belligerent-[A] thus an attack on the[N]
Aercolyn barracks blindsides Dalst.[A][N]
Blair rushes out into battle, hoping[N]
to find answers and stop a potential war.[A][X]

##Ch3_Narration
Although Blair's forces proved victorious,[N]
the conflict was far from over.[A][N]
Dalst had no intentions of letting this[N]
go unanswered,[A] and thus a small force was[N]
assembled to probe into Yg'stra.[A][N]
Although the risks are high, Blair wishes[N]
to lead, as if to prove herself to Dalst-[A][N]
and so, Blair sets off towards[N]
the Yg'stran-controlled Lowlands.[A][X]

##Ch4_Narration
The appearance of the Yg'stran commander[N]
drives the Dalstians out of the Lowlands.[A][N]
Blair sees no choice but to retreat[N]
to Mevion,[A] as the Yg'strans force[N]
her further and further out of Aercolyn.[A][N]
Though she regrets abandoning Dalst,[N]
she knows she'll return one day.[A][X]

##Ch5_Narration
The swampy terrain of Mevion serves[N]
a dual purpose-[A] fostering rich wildlife[N]
and foliage,[A] while also serving as nigh[N]
impregnable natural defense.[A][N]
Indeed, Blair's small force is able to[N]
evade the Yg'strans,[A] who cannot keep[N]
their momentum in the dense swamps.[A][N]
Blair ventures further into Mevion to seek[N]
refuge, but is met by hostility.[A][X]

##Base1_Narration
After the fall of the Mevionese royal[N]
family,[A] a new capital city was[N]
established, Kionius.[A] Named for an[N]
ancient Mevionese war hero,[A] Kionius[N]
has become a hub of commerce.[A][N]
It is here where the Parliament of[N]
Mevion convenes,[A] and where Blair's[N]
party shall pause and regroup.[A][X]

##Ch6_Narration
The Kingdom of Elba Cor.[A][N]
In ages past, the founders of Mevion[N]
and Elba Cor were a pair of heroes.[A][N]
This kinship has waned over time,[A][N]
especially after the Mevionese[N]
Revolution-[A] during which the young[N]
Elba Corian prince Zeke vanished,[A][N]
and was presumed dead.[A] Although Mevion[N]
denies involvement,[A] the populace of[N]
Elba Cor-[A] a people proud of their stalwart[N]
kings-[A] generally distrusts Mevion.[A][N]
As such, Blair is surprised when a pair of[N]
Elba Corians arrive,[A] bearing a royal[N]
decree and an offer of assistance.[A][X]

##Ch7_Narration
Blair and company arrive in Elba Cor,[A][N]
following a tense encounter with[N]
Mevion's bandits.[A] The party has been[N]
summoned to meet with the king,[A][N]
sympathetic to Blair's plight.[A][N]
However, the road there will not be easy,[A][N]
as Elba Cor's harsh mountains are home[N]
to harsher banditry,[A] and as Yg'stra[N]
plans to mount an invasion.[A][X]

##Ch8_Narration
Mt. Loile.[A][N]
Every year, this massive volcano erupts,[N]
spewing ash and dust along the continent.[A][N]
Interpretations of the volcano are[N]
vast and varied-[A] some see it as[N]
Opistus's wrath incarnate,[A] and others[N]
see it as the earth itself crying out.[A][N]
As thanks for protection and assistance,[A][N]
Blair offers to bring down a gang[N]
of bandits who have,[A] for unknown[N]
reason, made the lava fields their turf.[A][X]

##Base2_Narration
Because Elba Cor is surrounded on land[N]
by dense mountain ranges,[A] much of[N]
its trade and travel is by sea.[A][N]
As such, several prosperous port[N]
towns exist on the northern coast.[A][N]
Due to its relative closeness to the[N]
capital city Couria,[A] Port[N]
Moneubris,[A] named in honor of[N]
Saint Moneubris, is among the most[N]
vibrant and bustling ports.[A][N]
Moneubris is revered for saving the[N]
life of the seventh king's heir,[A][N]
and similarly, the port serves as[N]
the lifeblood of Elba Cor, in a sense.[A][X]

##Ch9_Narration
Blair's party escapes the[N]
Yg'stran forces via sea,[A][N]
hoping to trail the coastline[N]
and arrive in Opistia.[A][N]
However, just as banditry plagues[N]
the land,[A] so too does piracy plague[N]
the seas of Ulmaron.[A][N]
Thus, Blair and company are drawn[N]
into the defense of a small ship.[A][X]

##Base3_Narration
Survivors from the Opistian vessel[N]
are allowed to travel with Blair,[A][N]
both as an act of goodwill and[N]
to appeal to Opistia.[A][N]
Several days have passed with[N]
almost nothing of note:[A][N]
a rare moment of peace within the[N]
oft-turbulent lives of those aboard.[A][X]

##Ch10_Narration
As unexpected Yg'stran naval[N]
forces emerge from several sides,[A][N]
the Tradewinds is set aflame.[A][N]
As the ship begins to sink and[N]
Yg'stran forces close in,[A][N]
Cid reveals his hand and[N]
commandeers a nearby vessel.[A][N]
However, commandeering is only[N]
half the battle:[A][N]
the Yg'stran navy stands between[N]
Blair's party and the ship to freedom.[A][X]

##Ch11_Narration
The Theocracy of Opistia.[A][N]
An arid desert nation formed by[N]
founders of the Opistinian church,[A][N]
Opistia has historically served as[N]
a mediator in conflicts of old.[A][N]
In current times, the nation shares[N]
relatively positive relations with[A][N]
the rest of the continent.[A][N]
Of particular note is the alliance[N]
between Dalst and Opistia-[A][N]
one which may prove very impactful[N]
as Blair reaches the Opistian coast,[A][N]
following her escape from Yg'stra[N]
and Cid's valiant sacrifice.[A][X]

##Ch12_Narration
The Tower of Opistus.[A][N]
Built millenia ago to honor[N]
Opistus and to,[A] quite literally,[N]
reach new heights of spirituality,[A][N]
the Tower of Opistus is a marvel[N]
of architecture.[A] About 23 years[N]
ago,[A] Dalst came to Yg'stra with[N]
a unique offer:[A] to extend the Tower's[N]
height,[A] through magically augmented[N]
materials and design.[A] Thus, the Tower[N]
now reaches the edge of the heavens,[N][A]
a testament to faith and knowledge's[N]
harmony.[A] Blair's party, as a[N]
traditional Opistinian ritual,[A][N]
is sent on a trial within the tower,[A][N]
while Opistia prepares to invade Yg'stra.[A][X]

##Base4_Narration
Built at the base of the Tower,[N]
Opistinia, Opistia's capital,[A][N]
serves as a gathering hub for[N]
believers and explorers alike.[A][N]
A bountiful river flows between[N]
the extreme north and the tower-[A][N]
this particular stream is likened[N]
to the lifeblood of Opistus.[A][N]
The serenity of the city stands in[N]
contrast to rising tensions,[A][N]
as Archbishop Vladmir begins final[N]
preparations for the Yg'stran invasion.[A][X]

##Ch13_Narration
With the backing of Opistia,[N]
Blair's party prepares to invade.[A][N]
Yg'stra's all-out offensive leaves the[N]
capital relatively light on defense,[A][N]
and thus a decisive strike may[N]
bring the war to a swift end.[A][N]
Among the few troops left to guard[N]
the capital is Valden,[A][N]
the emperor's right hand, and a[N]
warrior second to none.[A][X]

##Ch14_Narration
After successfully reaching the Yg'stran[N]
palace,[A] Blair and company prepare to[N]
bring the war to an end.[A][N]
Commander Valden is dead,[A][N]
and Lazarus has taken command of[N]
the last of the Yg'stran defensive,[A][N]
as to finally have the chance to[N]
claim the revenge he seeks.[A][N]
To finally reach the emperor,[N]
and the truth of this war,[A][N]
Blair must confront Lazarus[N]
and finally bring him to an end.[A][X]

##ChZ1_Narration
The fallen kingdom of Holanis.[N]
A barren and dying land.[A][N]
In a forgotten age, the nation[N]
had prospered like few other.[A][N]
Similarly to Dalst, knowledge[N]
was one of their key resources.[A][N]
However, a calamity long forgotten[N]
by history scoured the land,[A][N]
with almost none living to tell[N]
their tales,[A] and only in the[N]
past century have settlers returned.[A][N]
Within the barren wasteland,[N]
a young light grows.[A][N]
A youth whose was thought to[N]
have been lost twelve years prior.[A][N]
After years of doubt and hardship,[N]
Hyperius's journey has borne fruit.[A][N]
...Prince Zeke is alive.[A][X]

##ChZ2_Narration
The rugged cliffs of Yg'stra carry on[N]
into the Lowlands in the west.[A][N]
Alongside this fierce terrain are[N]
fiercer rivers,[A] which have shaped[N]
the land over generations.[A][N]
Of course, man's ingenuity is a[N]
force of nature all its own.[A][N]
Yg'stra's brightest have crafted devices[N]
to assert their will over these rivers.[A][N]
Only by harnessing their power will[N]
Zeke's party be able to progress.[A][X]

##ChZ3_Narration
The natural defenses of Elba Cor,[A][N]
combined with its valiant military[N]
efforts,[A] had resulted in a[N]
stalemate with Yg'stra.[A][N]
After Blair's decisive victory at the[N]
Yg'stran palace,[A] some Yg'strans,[N]
perhaps in an act of defiance,[A][N]
continue to press the offensive[N]
in Elba Cor.[A][N]
As Zeke steps foot in his homeland[N]
for the first time in over a decade,[A][N]
he will have to confront the[N]
reverbations of this conflict.[A][X]

##Base5_Narration
The capital of Elba Cor, Couria,[A][N]
is perhaps the richest in the[N]
land when it comes to history.[A][N]
Elba Cor's royal line stretches[N]
further back than any surviving nation,[A][N]
and Couria has seen the wax and[N]
wane of innumerable moons.[A][N]
After the fall of Yg'stra, Blair[N]
returns to meet with the king once again.[A][N]
Meanwhile, Zeke and company finally[N]
reach the city,[A] where another reunion,[N]
one much more emotional, is taking place.[A][X]

##Ch15_Narration
The end of the Yg'stran war.[N]
A new age of Ulmaron begins.[A][N]
As Elba Cor, Opistia, and Dalst[N]
convene to decide Yg'stra's fate,[A][N]
unsettling news arrives.[A][N]
An unknown force is advancing on[N]
the Elba Corian palace.[A][N]
Faced with this, Blair's army[N]
prepares to mount a defensive,[A][N]
and Zeke, amidst the turmoil of[N]
his arrival,[A] decides to join with[N]
Blair to protect his newfound home.[A][X]

##Ch16_Narration
After the Holanian attack on Elba Cor,[A][N]
Blair and Zeke set out together to[N]
find answers.[A] The unprovoked attack[N]
leaves many on high alert,[A][N]
especially as Holanis's true power[N]
is still very much in the dark.[A][N]
Amidst this tension, Blair's forces[N]
encounter an unusual sight:[A][N]
an attack on the Elba Corian Archives,[A][N]
a large library storying much of[N]
Ulmaron's lore and history.[A][X]

##Ch17_Narration
The Lowlands. An ashen hellscape.[A][N]
Each year, after Loile's eruption,[A][N]
the northern winds force the spewed[N]
ashes and dusts downward,[A][N]
coating a belt of the continent in[N]
a beautiful yet dangerous dust.[A][N]
Despite the ash's perpetuity, life[N]
manages to find a way in the Lowlands,[A][N]
though many inhabitants are either[N]
destitute or banditry.[A][N]
Blair's party makes their way through[N]
the Lowlands,[A] as it is the fastest[N]
route to Holanis,[A] only to encounter[N]
the harsh reality of this harsh land.[A][X]

##Ch18_Narration
Blair's forces continue through the[N]
Lowlands, wary of the dangers ahead.[A][N]
Though they triumphed over the Brothers[N]
Ed,[A] more remain who wish to loot[N]
the party for all that they are worth.[A][N]
As they near the Holanian border,[N]
a new danger emerges,[A][N]
amongst the suffocating darkness[N]
and nigh-unnavigable mountains.[A][X]

##Base6_Narration
Blair's party decides to pause and[N]
make camp at the edge of Holanis.[A][N]
Though bandit attacks are easing up,[A][N]
tension runs high as the group fears[N]
possible skirmishes with Holanis.[A][N]
Blair and Zeke take this opportunity to[N]
pause and reflect on the journey so far.[A][X]

##Ch19_Narration
While Holanis is indeed a barren[N]
wasteland,[A] it is also a land[N]
of brilliant ancient architecture.[A][N]
Masterfully crafted buildings dot the[N]
landscape, their makers lost to time.[A][N]
Three landmarks stand out above the rest:[A][N]
Fort Jraeyan, an ancient stronghold,[N]
Zeimstadt Temple, a revered holy site,[A][N]
and the Great Aqueduct, built along[N]
the mountained side of Ineubris River.[A][N]
While much of the aqueduct has fallen[N]
into disrepair,[A] enough of it is still[N]
functional enough to sustain life,[A][N]
perhaps a testament to how barren[N]
Holanis truly is.[A][N]
After escaping the dark recesses of[N]
the Lowlands,[A] Blair's party arrives[N]
at an intact stretch of aqueduct,[A][N]
only to encounter forces that're[N]
not quite what they expect.[A][X]

##Ch20_Narration
Zeimstadt Temple. One of the great[N]
landmarks of ancient Holanis.[A][N]
Once a reverent site dedicated to[N]
preservation of the past,[A][N]
the calamities that wrought Holanis[N]
have left the temple in ruins.[A][N]
New settlers of Holanis stray from[N]
the temple,[A] fearing legends of[N]
divine retribution.[A][N]
Despite this, Blair's party advances[N]
on the temple,[A] confident that it[N]
shall reveal secrets of grave import.[A][X]

##ChV1_Narration
The sorrow of the common man[N]
is often gone ignored.[A][N]
No nation can ensure life[N]
goes on smoothly for all,[A][N]
and thus few even try.[A][N]
Those outside of the military[N]
hold it in contempt,[A] [N]for their[N]
true heroes are the land's mercenaries.[A][N]
Indeed, Ulmaron's tense politics[N]
breed lucrative mercenaries.[A][N]
Of these mercenary groups,[A][N]
the most beloved is perhaps[N]
the Viridian Mercenaries,[A][N]
named after their leader,[A][N]
a valorous soul who wishes[A][N]
to serve the people,[A][N]
and to spread hope amidst the[N]
aftermath of the Elba Cor-Yg'stran War.[A][X]

##Base9_Narration
Gohranos. A small city, and the[N]
de-facto capital of Holanis.[A][N]
Over many years, influential[N]
individuals have gathered,[A][N]
in an effort to construct a new[N]
Holanian government,[A] and Gohranos[N]
is at the center of those efforts.[A][N]
The city's overseen by a senate of[N]
elected citizenry,[A] modeled after[N]
the Mevionese government.[A][N]
It is a remote city that few outside[N]
of Holanis even know the existence of,[A][N]
and the fate of Holanis as a nation[N]
is arguably in its hands.[A][X]
