##C13AmaraBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmara]
You will not breach our palace.[N]
Not today, and not ever![A][N]
Prepare to fall from grace![A][X]

##C13AmaraMikeyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmara]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Aren't you[N]
Joan's brother?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps I am. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm also my own man.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Fighting to end this[N]
war my way.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadAmara]
You think to defy us?[N]
Your family's legacy?[A][N]
I'll show you the error[N]
of your ways, traitor![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I knew this wouldn't be easy.[N]
But this path is mine alone.[A][X]

##C13AmaraCarbonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmara]
Do I know you?[N]
You seem[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] familiar.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
The name's Carbon. Sorry[N]
it has to be like this, Amara.[A][N]
But I can't abandon my pal.[N]
You get it, don't you?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadAmara]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Does country not stand[N]
above all else for you?[A][N]
Well, then. This is goodbye.[A][X]

##C13ValdenBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
I am Valden, the emperor's[N]
most trusted man.[A][N]
You have the honor of dying[N]
by my hand.[A][X]

##C13ValdenMikeyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
Mikey. What will your sister[N]
think when she hears of this?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][CloseEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know.[N]
That thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] terrifies me.[A][N]
But I have to do this.[A][N]
I can't stand for[N]
this war anymore.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
Very well. Show your convictions[N]
by striking me down.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey]
Of course, Commander.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry for this.[A][X]

##C13ValdenCarbonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
So, you've defected.[N]
How unfortunate.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
That's all I get? [OpenQuote]You[CloseQuote]?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say my name.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Carbon.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Thanks, Commander.[N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] apologies.[A][N]
But I'm doing this for[N]
my friends.[A][N]
You understand, right?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][X]


##Ch13_Mikey_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon me. Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
with Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes?[N]
Why?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just curious, is all.[N]
You're not charging at us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel like we're getting nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'd rather not be here.[N]
Frankly, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hate the battlefield.[A][N]
But what other choice do I have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does anything say you HAVE[N]
to fight us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I can't just desert.[N]
I'd be throwing away everything.[A][N]
And that's before considering that[N]
my sister'd have my head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you don't wish to fight[N]
us, we can keep you safe.[A][N]
In fact, if you join us, we may[N]
be able to end this war sooner.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd ask me to fight against[N]
my own homeland?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But then again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've had my doubts about this war.[N]
And for you to risk yourself like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That's it. I know what I must do.[N]
I'm Mikey. Guide me well.[A][N]
If I must fight at all, I fight[N]
to bring back the Yg'stra I loved.[A][X]

##Ch13_Carbon_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that you, Mikey?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why're you pointing that[N]
at me?[A] I know you're not much[N]
for this war[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I didn't think it'd send[N]
you off like this![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This isn't right, Carbon.[N]
What Yg'stra's done.[A][N]
I'm going to end this,[N]
on the side of the just.[A][N]
Join me if you wish.[A][N]
Otherwise, I fear we may have[N]
to strike each other down.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is serious, isn't it?[A][N]
Well, you're my brother from another.[N]
I'm with you, all the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, Carbon.[N]
I know we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Besides, if we killed each other here,[N]
I'd never have your cooking again.[A][N]
Your food's to die for.[N]
Not literally, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Glad to see you're taking this[N]
seriously, bud.[A][N]
Just don't sprain yourself[N]
showing off to the new army.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll sprain myself as much[N]
as I wish. It's worth it.[A][X]

##C13WhoIsThisHorse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Get away, foul beast![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look, over there! People[N]
for you to latch onto![A][N]
I'm sorry for throwing this horse[N]
on you, but please understand.[A][N]
Some captured supplies got delivered to[N]
the capital a few weeks ago,[A][N]
and I suppose some horses[N]
were among them.[A][N]
This one in particular[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
This horse.[A][N]
He's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] Well, he's strong-willed.[N]
Must've had one hell of a rider.[A][N]
But now he's eating me out[N]
of house and home![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No, boy! I'm out of apples![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Go away![A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He's your problem now. Sorry.[A][X]

##C13WestVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
As you've surely noticed, we've lots[N]
of artillery in Yg'stra.[A][N]
Between it and our cliffs, we're nigh[N]
impossible to invade![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I said nigh. Exceptions happen.[A][N]
Anyway, imagine if you could outrange[N]
those ballistae![A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can't, but this'll give[N]
you something of a taste of that range.[A][X]

##C13EastVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
You're with the invaders, are you not?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, you're not my problem.[A][N]
I'm up and leaving this army for good.[N]
Blame my squad leader.[A][N]
The way the dastard ran things[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, I don't know why I stayed.[A][N]
There's this merc group I've heard good[N]
things about. Gonna try and join 'em.[A][N]
If you run into the Viridian Mercenaries,[N]
don't be surprised to hear tales of Callum.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know what? Take this.[N]
Someone in the army handed it to me.[A][N]
Not my problem anymore.[A][X]

##C13SouthVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
A-are you here to kill us all?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No? You're trying to keep[N]
us out of harm's way?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was not expecting that.[N]
Guess what we've heard was wrong.[A][N]
Well, in that case, do what you must.[N]
Bring this war to an end.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell anyone about this.[A][X]

##C13HorseReunion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Juri? Is that you?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That coat is unmistakable.[A][N][CloseEyes]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is truly miraculous![N]
I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'd thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that I'd[N]
never see you again.[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
You're as pristine as I remember[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
They even left my banner lance[N]
right in your saddle![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There, there, boy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm here to stay.[A][N]
Are you ready to saddle up?[N]
Time to bring this to an end![A][X]

##C13House1Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan3]
Are you looking to get stronger?[N]
Well, I've a good idea for you.[A][N]
See that arena over there? Bloodsport[N]
can be quite enriching![A][N]
Hell, I don't just mean character growth.[N]
It'll richen your pockets too.[A][N]
Just know that it's do-or-die in there.[N]
Emphasis on the die.[A][N]
They import special weapons that're[N]
massively destructive, yet lightweight.[A][N]
Guess that combination makes for[N]
good entertainment.[A][N]
Supposedly, they also draw in combatants[N]
from all walks of life.[A][N]
Who knows? You might see nobility in there.[N]
Hell! The prince of a nation, for all I know.[A][N]
The arena's a lovely place, I say.[A][X]

##C13House2Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadKid1]
I was playin' by the palace once,[N]
and you won't believe what I saw![A][N]
There, shining in the moat's waterfall,[N]
was a beautiful door![A][N]
It looked like a shop beyond my wildest[N]
dreams! I swear I saw it! Pinky swear![A][N]
I think the door said it's for members[N]
only. If only I were a member[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C13House3Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan2]
I heard the Elba Corian offense is being[N]
led by Sonia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What a treasure![A][N]
She's the pride of Yg'stra's army[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And a beaut beyond compare, to boot![A][N]
Of course, Joan's nothing to scoff at, either![N]
She's an ace with a sword or an axe.[A][N]
The two of them make quite the team[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I heard they're pals with[N]
the legendary Tobias[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
If that's true[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Imagine all[N]
three on the field together![A][N]
Alas, Tobias is long retired[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That'll never happen.[A][X]

##C13House4Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman3]
Recently, I was pacing near the palace,[N]
and I thought I saw a dreadful sight.[A][N]
Words fail to describe it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It was like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a demon.[A][N]
But it was also[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] strangely beautiful?[N]
Beyond any of our imaginations.[A][N]
Why would it have been at the palace?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sure it was nothing.[A][N]
Nothing but my weary mind.[A][X]

##C13House5Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
My luck is just the worst.[A][N]
Notice anything about my house?[N]
Like what it's next to?[A][N]
I'm a responsible Yg'stran citizen,[N]
yet I've a barricade adjacent to me![A][N]
What if that thing breaks? It'll fall[N]
right on my house! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Probably.[A][N]
Even if it doesn't, I feel slighted.[A][N]
And don't get me started on it blocking[N]
my morning walk's path.[A][X]

##C13House6Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
That guy over there? Next to the wall?[N]
He's overreacting.[A][N]
The wall's fine. It won't crash[N]
into his house if it falls.[A][N]
And honestly? I think it has charm.[N]
Character. Class, even.[A][N]
Frankly, I'm envious. At least[N]
I can look at it.[A][X]

##C13House7Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan5]
So, let's say, hypothetically, you're[N]
trying to invade Yg'stra.[A][N]
You'll want to be mindful of where you step.[N]
There's carefully coordinated defense zones.[A][N]
By talking to me now, you're in one.[N]
Keep on your guard for reinforcements.[A][N]
From what I've heard, the other zone is[N]
everything above our highest stairs.[A][N]
Wait. Did I just tell a foe all this?[N]
God damn it.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
They're closer than I had hoped.[A][N]
I think it'd be for the best if I[N]
moved to a position in the palace.[A][N]
Amara![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadAmara]
I understand, General.[N]
I'll hold them back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My thanks. Let's hope your[N]
presence isn't needed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They'll never take me down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good luck. I'll be[N]
going now.[A][X]

##C13ValdenLeavesAmaraDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
They're closer than I had hoped.[A][N]
I think it'd be for the best if I[N]
moved to a position in the palace.[A][N]
It's risky, leaving the gate[N]
unguarded like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I think this'll work out[N]
far better in the end.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Let us hope you[N]
return to who you once were.[A][X]
