##_Ch10Escape
Everyone escapes[N]
in 18 turns.[X]

##Ch10_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
today's a good day to be on a boat that isn't on fire[A][X]

##Ch10_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadJonas]
Sir! Their hull's been breached.[N]
Their vessel is taking on water.[A][N]
...It also appears that there's[N]
another vessel, further away.[A][N]
Perhaps an escape route?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Brilliant! I knew this[N]
would be a worthy diversion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I may, sir? ...Why are[N]
we doing this, again?[A][N]
Surely Valden's orders are[N]
the word of the emperor.[A][N]
And as far as I know, you've[N]
been told not to partake in...[A][N]
these so-called goose chases.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does that bastard think this a[N]
waste of time?[A] This young lord's[N]
been a thorn in my-[A] in Yg'stra's[N]
side since this war's begun![A][N]
Once I take her down, they'll[N]
recognize my genius![A][N]
And if they disagree, well...[A][N]
That's what this beaut's for.[N]
The Arkhinal.[A] The strongest axe,[N]
for the strongest man of all time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Of course, sir.[N]
My orders?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Take a position near the planks[N]
we've set up.[A] Charge their army[N]
as they attempt to escape.[A][N]
I've got some final preparations[N]
to make, and then this'll all end.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...Why am I stuck under him?[A][N]
After this battle, I'm transferring[N]
to Valden's unit.[A] Sane man,[N]
AND Amara's in it.[A][N]
I wonder how she's been?[N]
Not the time, of course.[A][X]

##Ch10_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
We ain't the time to think, lass![N]
Ye gotta get a move on. Now![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What about you? That man is[N]
unfathomably powerful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfathomable power, eh? That sounds[N]
like a challenge for me boys![A][N]
We'll fight 'em off.[N]
...And then regroup.[A][N]
But yer mission is too important[N]
to risk.[A] Ye gotta get to Opistia,[N]
and find a way to end this war.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
...Very well. Thank you, captain.[N]
I'm sure we'll see each other again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, yes. Get a move on, now![A][N]
I reckon there's not much time before[N]
even that tiny boat can escape.[A][N]
Just remember, my mate'll only drop[N]
the gangplank once you're near.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Of course.[N]
...Good luck.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
...Well, boys. This may be it fer us.[N]
But we be proud men o' the sea.[A][N]
To go down swingin' against tyranny...[N]
That's a glorious end, in my book.[A][N][CloseEyes]
...May yer fortunes be vast,[N]
young lassie.[A][X]

##Ch10_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
We've... just barely...[N]
made it...[A][N]
Where's... Cid... and his crew...?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
It appears... that they have fallen.[N]
They bought us time for our escape.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This... can't be...[N]
Oh, gods...[A][N][CloseEyes]
What... have I done?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
This was their choice.[A][N]
Without their sacrifice,[N]
we ALL would have died.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
damn that sucks[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...It does nobody well to think like that.[N]
...Try to rest.[A] It's been a trying day[N]
for all of us.[A][X]

##Ch10_Sveltzalus_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSveltzalus]
......[N][A][MoveMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]
...What exactly... are you supposed to be?[N]
You're just... a floating eye![A][N]
That can't be real... This doesn't[N]
make any sense![A] And yet it's[N]
clearly here in front of me.[A][N]
Well... Let's assume this is perfectly[N]
normal and nothing is wrong.[A][N]
Assume that people-sized eyes exist.[A][N]
It seems... friendly?[N]
Are you a friend, eye?[A][N][OpenRight][MoveRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]
...I'll take that as a yes.[N]
So it seems to understand me.[A][N]
We're in quite a precarious situation,[N]
whatever your name is.[A][N]
Could you help us out?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft]
Wonderful! Though I guess I should[N]
give you some kind of name...[A][N]
How about... Sveltzalus?[N]
It feels... right, I guess.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft]
Glad to hear! Thanks, Sveltzalus.[A][X]

##C10GameOverMessage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]

##C10LazarusCidBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
So, you must be Cid.[N]
Some kind of pirate king.[A][N]
Know that to me, you are[N]
nothing but an obstacle.[A][N]
A barricade between me[N]
and my vindication.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Aye? And what're ye gonna[N]
do about it?[A] It's me[N]
duty to protect the lass.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
[OpenQuote]What're ye gonna do?[CloseQuote] Ha![N]
Do you really need to ask?[A][N][CloseEyes]
As I've said, you're in my way.[N]
...And now you're going to die.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Prepare for a miserable end![A][X]

##C10LazarusBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Ah... There she is.[N]
The lordling.[A][N]
The source of my shame.[A][N]
Your death shall be[N]
my absolution![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
You're nothing but[N]
a deranged lunatic![A][N]
Yg'stra's after Elba Cor,[N]
not me![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I'm not Yg'stra, now am I?[A][N]
All I am is one man, bound[N]
to change history.[A][N]
...You said I'm nothing[N]
but a lunatic?[A][N]
Perhaps you're right.[A][N]
You'll die clinging to[N]
your pathetic ideals,[A][N]
and I'll be alive. Perhaps[N]
a [OpenQuote]lunatic,[CloseQuote] but alive.[A][X]

##C10LazarusBattle

##C10_LazThreat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
That's it. No more waiting[N]
