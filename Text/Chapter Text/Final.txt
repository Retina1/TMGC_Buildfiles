##Final_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
This is[...] truly a wonder.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is, Elcorian.[A][N]
You can see forever from up here.[N]
[...]It's unfortunate, really.[A][N]
The world deserves this freedom.[N]
This contentment.[A][N]
But it's a terrible and lawless place.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's definitely[...][N]
room for improvement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But that's why I'm where I am.[N]
So I can change this world.[A][N]
I'll do anything it takes,[N]
for the future of man.[A][N]

##Final_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
All of this can be put behind us.[A][N]
Perhaps a clean slate for Dalst[N]
is in order.[A][N]
But I know my vision for a[N]
better world is[...] right.[A][N]
It[...] must be.[A][N]
Look down there. Look outside.[A][N]
It's all so[...] clouded. And I[N]
will lead them to light.[A][N]
And you, too, can guide them[N]
all to a glorious future.[A][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Unfortunate.[A][N]
It appears, then, that your[N]
path must come to an end.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Goodbye.[A][X]

##FinalGirardBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Why must you get in the way[N]
of my[...] of Dalst's future?[A][N]
Of our ideal society? Of our[N]
glorious path before us?[A][N]
[...]No matter. I shall see[N]
my dreams realized.[A][N]
And you shall die for nothing.[A][X]

I[...] can't[...] die[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
I won't[...] die[...][A][X]

##FinalGirardDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
My promised land[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
I will not[...] live[N]
to see you[...][A][N]
This world will not[...][N]

The cycle will[...][N]
never end[...][A][X]
