Seize annex,[N]
then tower.[X]

##Ch19_NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
I'm off duty now, but normally I[N]
help here at the Aqueduct.[A][N]
Mainly just going in the riverbed,[N]
picking up rocks,[A] pretending I[N]
know what those rocks mean,[A][N]
nodding at somebody important,[N]
handing the rock over to them,[A][N]
and repeating for hours at a time.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's a bit mind numbing.[A][N]
Despite that, I like it. Feels good[N]
to contribute to science.[A][X]

##Ch19_SouthHouse1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
I've heard rumors lately. Apparently,[N]
though I'm not sure from where,[A][N]
more Myrmidons have been emerging.[A][N]
You know the Myrmidons, right?[N]
Swordsmen attuned with magic?[A][N]
Anyway, they're not normal, I hear.[A][N]
It's like the power of a regular[N]
Myrmidon has been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I don't know, forced into average[N]
swordsmen.[A] They're strong,[N]
apparently. But at a great cost.[A][N]
If you see one of them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Be careful, please.[A][X]

##Ch19_SouthHouse2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadIan]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hi![A][N]
I'm Ian! Are you on an adventure?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can I come along?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Aw, man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]One day, I'll go[N]
on an adventure.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Someday.[A][X]

##Ch19_BlairFlood
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this lever for?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]Unlock Dam[CloseQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, don't mind if I do![A][X]

##Ch19_ZekeFlood
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
They were guarding this lever.[N]
It must be of great import.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]Unlock Dam.[CloseQuote] Well, then.[N]
Let's see what happens.[A][X]

##Ch19_MichaelIsAngy
[OpenMidRight][LoadMichael]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why's the tower unsealing itself?[N]
That's not supposed to happen[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That is, unless something goes[N]
horridly wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
What in the hell is this?![N]
WHO FLOODED THE RIVER!?[A][N]
Do you IDIOTS know how long it'll[N]
take to dry it up again?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadBaddie3]
Michael! Intruders have been spotted![A][N]
They appear to have taken control of[N]
the western annex![A][N][OpenMidRight]
For the love of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Damn it![A][N]
Signal the reserve troops![N]
Get them here on the double![A][N]
I'm not letting this ruin my[N]
brilliant discoveries.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well, sir. Shall I seal[N]
the control tower as I leave?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't bother. If they come near us,[N]
we'll fry them into submission.[A][N]
Besides, I'll have to fix the dam[N]
after this battle anyway.[A][N]
No point making it harder on[N]
myself to leave later.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do bad things happen to[N]
smart people like me?[A][X]

##Ch19_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can hardly tell it now,[N]
but I believe we're in Holanis.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thought something feels off.[N]
The map says there should be a river here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Odd. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that[N]
the Aqueduct over there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Does it look old and worn down?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Somewhat. And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It also looks guarded.[N]
Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll have to approach and see.[N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's our plan, anyway?[A][N]
I doubt we can just politely ask if[N]
they're truly the ones behind the attack.[A][N]
In fact[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This whole place feels off.[A][X]

##Ch19_Opening2
[OpenFarRight][LoadZeke][OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
Pardon me.[A][N]
I don't recognize you. Did the[N]
boss send more researchers?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Forget it. I've got results to[N]
pore over.[A] Make sure to pull[N]
your weight.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe then we can get[N]
assigned to something big.[A][N]
Like Zeimstadt.[A][X]

##Ch19_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Research? Is this place[N]
some manner of facility now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Now that you mention it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I saw some similar devices to the[N]
ones set up here.[A] Back in lower[N]
Yg'stra, I believe.[A][N]
Perhaps the river's disappearance[N]
has something to do with them.[A][N]
In any case, it seems that this[N]
may not be what we were-[A][X]

##Ch19_Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadBlank]
Oh, for the love of-[N]
Michael was JUST here![A][N]
How'd he miss this bunch[N]
of trespassers?[A][N]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sortie up.[N]
We'll handle them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why's he get to hide[N]
in the control tower, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never mind that. Looks like[N]
we're not escaping without a fight.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even if this isn't their main force,[N]
it's still suspicious activity.[A][N]
We can't leave stones unturned.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It looks as if that control[N]
tower is sealed tight.[A][N]
If we can open it, we've a shot at[N]
their deepest secrets, I'd imagine.[A][N]
But we'll take this one step at a time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Certainly.[A] Everyone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Be careful. We're[N]
no longer fighting thieves.[A][N]
We've no idea what power Holanis has[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But we've come too far to stop now.[A][X]
//maybe break up into map events?

##Ch19_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
The Aqueduct is ours. As I guessed,[N]
it appears to lack what we seek.[A][N]
But I'm sure there's still much to[N]
gain from investigating their research.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. We'll rest and investigate for[N]
a short while.[A] And then, I believe we'd[N]
be off to Fort Jraeyan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][X]

##Ch19_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Find anything?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I know what they[N]
drained the river for.[A][N]
Have a look.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] bones?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's unlike almost anything I've ever seen.[N]
It almost looks like the remains of a dragon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So they dried up a river[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
for bones?[A] What's their goal?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm not quite sure. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If dragons are[N]
starting to appear[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This can't be a coincidence.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. Their boss[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Earlier he mentioned[N]
something that stuck with me.[A][N]
A place called Zeimstadt.[A][N]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've heard of that[N]
place before.[A][N]
When I was living in Holanis,[N]
it was always a rumor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
People would speak of it in[N]
hushed tones.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now that you mention it,[N]
I see a mark on this map.[A][N]
Would that be it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd wager. And if that man said[N]
that he'd get assigned there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There may be further connection[N]
to the dragons.[A][N]
The legends of it I've heard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
mention beasts of terror.[A][N]
That'd all line up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we afford that time?[A][N]
Especially with the mercenaries[N]
on the way to Jraeyan?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's the question, I guess.[A][N]
But I think so. We can't leave[N]
any stone unturned with this threat.[A][N]
And the timeframe we've got is[N]
fairly generous.[A][N]
We'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be fine.[A][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. I trust your judgement.[A][N]
We'll march to Zeimstadt.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If the legends are all true[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What could this all mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I truly wish I knew. For now, all[N]
we can do is keep pushing forward.[A][X]

##_Ch19SysText
Seize the carpet tile in the northwest[N]
to cause the river to flow.[A][N]
This will also open up the southern[N]
tower and allow you to seize to win.[A][N]
Note that if any units are left in the[N]
riverbed, they will be stuck.[A][N]
This applies to both player and enemy[N]
units.[A] Be careful if you don't want[N]
half of your army swimming.[A][N]
Also, note that both Blair and Zeke[N]
have the ability to seize points.[A][N]
This will hold true for all future[N]
maps with a seize objective.[A][X]

##C19MichaelBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
My results are on the cusp[N]
of brilliance.[A][N]
Let us finally begin[N]
the experiment![A][X]

##C19MichaelSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought the boss[N]
said Surveil was dead.[A][N]
A project in the ground.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this, then?[A][N]
Perhaps I can dissect you.[N]
Revive the Surveil Project.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This may sting a bit.[A][X]

##C19MichaelHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're the escaped[N]
subject, are you not?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Indeed![A][N]
And you, my friend, shall be sent[N]
spiraling down into hell![A][N]
A fitting trade for the hell[N]
I've experienced, no?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
All we did was in the name[N]
of progress. Of the future.[A][N]
Sacrifice is necessary[N]
in all things.[A][N]
In any case, you must[N]
be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] euthanized.[A][X]

##C19MichaelDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMichael]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a failing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] on my part[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
