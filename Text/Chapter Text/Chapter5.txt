Woah, there! Slow down,[N]
Rachael! Do you want me to fall?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Amusing as it'd be, I'd rather you[N]
not die. After all, imagine the paperwork.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, you're very funny.[A][N]
Look, have you ever held on for dear[N]
life to a creature that hates you-[A][N]
purely for being a dude!?[N]
...It's not very fun![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Complain later. I think I see them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]All I see is darkness and your back,[N]
but I'll trust ya.[A] Do we make our move?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...They appear to be embroiled[N]
in conflict. On the run, as well.[A][N]
It may be for the best to lay low.[A][N]
We wouldn't want to overwhelm them,[N]
get caught in the conflict,[A][N]
or especially be mistaken for a foe.[N]
We'll head to Kionius.[A][N]
I'd imagine that's their target.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]More flyin'? Can't we take[N]
ten minutes to stretch?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...No.[A][N]
(My king... Surely you could've sent[N]
someone besides Cassius...)[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Hey! I heard that![A][X]
