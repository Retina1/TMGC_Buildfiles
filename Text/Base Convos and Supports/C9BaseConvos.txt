[OpenMidLeft][LoadCid][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Tell me, captain. What IS it[N]
like being a pirate?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, that be a vague question.[N]
Piracy... It be everything.[A][N]
It's not just a thing we do...[N]
It's a way we live.[A][N]
Treatin' it as a hobby or a job[N]
or whatnot... That be disingenuous.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh. Guess I never thought of it[N]
like that. Well, then...[A][N]
How'd you end up meeting the king?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Och, now that be a tale all its own.[A][N]
Me memory's a bit fuzzy, but I[N]
believe it began wit' other pirates.[A][N]
Some rival crew were botherin' a[N]
civilian ship,[A] so me boys stepped[N]
in. ...Pure altruism, of course.[A][N]
No plans o' makin' off with some[N]
booty of our own.[A][N]
Well, turns out that was more than[N]
a civilian ship.[A] It was the Elba[N]
Corian royal family's private vessel.[A][N]
Before we knew it, we were somethin'[N]
of heroes.[A] Frankly, those other[N]
pirates were pathetic runts.[A][N]
But, aye... That be beyond the point.[A][N]
The king invited me mateys for drinks,[N]
which, if ye know pirates,[A][N]
is basically askin' to empty yer coffers,[N]
and the rest be history.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's... quite the story, captain![N]
King Brandl's quite lucky to have you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, and now ye be lucky to have him.[N]
So, ye be lucky to have me, too.[A][N]
Speakin' o' lucky...[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Catch this![A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
What's this you lobbed at me?[N]
A book?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ayup. Found this little number during[N]
a rumble wit' some upstart pirates.[A][N]
Their cap' was this man named Gregorias.[N]
Thinks he has what it takes to rule the seas.[A][N]
Well, we proved 'im wrong. Got some[N]
spoils in exchange for lettin' em go.[A][N]
That book was among 'em, but...[N]
Literature don't serve us well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, captain. Both for[N]
your tales, and the book.[A][X]

Hmph.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's the problem, Peggy?[N]
Gettin' seasick?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't you patronize me, bastard.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. You've never been[N]
one for seafood.[A][N]
And when you're a pirate, you kinda[N]
need to get used to that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd think the pirates would get tired[N]
of eating fish all the time, right?[A][N]
Why the hell don't they have any[N]
snazzier cuisine?[A] Something with[N]
a bit of pizazz?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Look. If you want it, I've[N]
got a bit of dried beef.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why didn't you say so?[N]
Give it.[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
*Munch!* *Crunch!*[N]
Damn, that was good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aren't you glad you've kept me[N]
around for this long?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. Saving your life a decade ago[N]
all built up to this moment.[A][N]
Quite worth it, I'd say.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Glad to hear. Gotta say, never thought[N]
my life would turn out this way.[A][N]
...It's nice.[A][X]

...Greetings, Arin.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Desmond. How have you been faring?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As well as one can. I must admit, even[N]
with my skill, this is a bit much.[A][N]
Maintaining a small army is one thing,[N]
but actually fighting a war...[A][N]
It's been rough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must agree.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
By the by, where did you learn[N]
swordplay?[A] Your techniques are[N]
something else.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Where...? That's... hard to answer.[A][N]
As far as I can remember, I picked[N]
up a sword for the first time,[A][N]
and everything just... clicked.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's... quite something.[A][N]
I've never heard someone taking[N]
to the blade that easily.[A][N]
Took me many years to master lances,[N]
and several more to pick up axes.[A][N]
But, hey. Everyone learns differently.[N]
And your skills are splendid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad you think so highly of me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ability deserves to be recognized.[N]
And you're among the best we have.[A][N]
Don't forget that.[A][X]
