##Prologue_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
...Whew... It's been some time.[N]
I forgot how far Arbordia truly was.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I mean... Are you really surprised?[A][N]
You live at the extreme tip of Dalst.[N]
The capital would naturally be more central.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I suppose. Still. I could swear[N]
it was a far shorter trip.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, back then, you WERE a child.[N]
Didn't ever really take this by foot.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I get it.[N]
You can stop now.[A][N]
...What's that over there?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If I had to wager a guess,[N]
either bandits or rebels.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Rebels? Here?[N]
Why?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I swear, you're clueless.[A][N]
To put it simply, the populace is[N]
uneasy about recent negotiations-[A][N]
between Dalst and Yg'stra.[A][N]
There's a popular belief that the[N]
Yg'strans have been gearing for war,[A][N]
and that Dalst's attempts at an alliance[N]
will just lead Dalst into conflict.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see.[A][N]
In any case, we should probably quell this.[A][N]
I fear these rebels may harm the[N]
civilian populace,[A] and I'm sure[N]
the higher-ups will understand.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
That's a bold move, but if[N]
you're confident,[A] I'm with[N]
you all the way.[A][N]
Just be careful.[A][N]
It'd be quite the shame for[N]
us to perish so quickly.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But of course![A][N]
Together, I have no doubts[N]
that we'll prevail![A][X]
