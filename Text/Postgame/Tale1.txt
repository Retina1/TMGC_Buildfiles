[...]You've won this day, rebels.[A][N]
Take your victory. I[...] have faith[N]
in my king that he'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Keep your faith to yourself.[A][N]
I trust the will of my countrymen[N]
more than of my statesman.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We're leaving, everyone.[N]
We've done our job.[A][N]
Their forces are crippled, and[N]
this opens up our main front.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Are you not going to kill me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're hardly worth it.[A][N]
If you've given up the fight,[N]
I see no reason to bury another.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I know you want us to hate you.[A][N]
To give you the satisfaction of[N]
some final condemnation.[A][N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadButch][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
You handled that quite well.[A][N]
[...]Any reason you didn't finish her?[N]
My sons seem quite disappointed.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadMarque]
She should rot in the name[N]
of our glorious Mevion![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm not sure of that myself.[A][N]
[...]A new Mevion's near. Maybe I thought[N]
she could learn from it.[A][N]
Maybe she's too stuck in her ways[N]
to ever truly change.[A][N]
But after what I've seen, I didn't[N]
want to steal that chance from her.[A][N][OpenLeft]
And you'd steal it from all the[N]
others who have fought and died?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I can save a life once and have[N]
it mean something[...][A][N]
[...]Let's keep going. The revolution's[N]

Have at me, rebel.[A][X]

##Tale1PeggyArgentBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
A medic[...] Should you[N]
not be in the backlines?[A][N]
Or has the rebel force come[N]
to needing you on the front?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
This is my choice, oldie.[A][N]
I've beat the snot out of[N]
all your goons.[A][N]

good Peggy bashing![A][X]

##Tale1PeterArgentBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeter]
Don't take this personally.[A][N]
I'm fine with whoever's on the[N]
throne, long as money flows.[A][N]
[...]Right now, I get paid if you[N]
end up dead on the ground.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
It would be wrong of me to[N]
claim loftier morals.[A][N]
[...]Be on your guard, mercenary.[A][X]

##Tale1RiftArgentBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
You're[...] quite small.[N]
And your eyes are shut.[A][N]
Are you[...] sure you wish[N]
to be here, child?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRift][CloseEyes]
I'm a proud young Mev.[A][N]
And I'll gladly beat you with[N]

all scared of you![A][X]

##Tale1MitchellArgentBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
Break yourself upon me,[N]
rabble of Mevion![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadMitchell]
What, the rabble that makes[N]
this land what it is?[A][N]
That's what you think of us?[A][N]
[...]Something's gonna break[N]
today, lady,[A] and it's not[N]
gonna be me.[A][X]

##Tale1ClarqueArgentBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
If I can strike you down,[N]
my life may mean something.[A][N]
[...]Don't hold this against me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
And don't speak as if we[N]
know each other, rebel.[A][N]
There is no gravitas to this.[N]
No meaning at all.[A][X]

##Tale1MarqueArgentBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadMarque]
For Mevion![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
Is any of this bloodshed[N]
truly for Mevion, anymore?[A][N]
Or do we just wish to see[N]
the other side in the ground?[A][N]
[...]Apologies. If it's a fight[N]
you want, I'll provide.[A][X]

##Tale1StarqueArgentBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadStarque]
For liberty![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent]
From a certain point of[N]
view, we fight for liberty.[A][N]
What makes one virtue rise[N]
above the other?[A][N]
Is it nothing more than who[N]
lives to tell the tale?[A][N]
[...]Who'll live to speak[N]
of our virtues, rebel?[A][X]

##Tale1ParqueArgentBattle

the cycle of revolution?[A][N]

than I, rebel.[A][X]

##Tale1Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[...]You remember the plan, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't need to tell me twice.[A][N]
They're stretched thin as a sheet.[N]
We storm their rear.[A][N]
Take down General Hayfords.[N]
We'll be heroes, all that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good, good.[A] [...]We're as tattered[N]
as they are, Butch.[A][N]
I'm[...] not fully convinced we'll[N]
all walk out of this.[A][N]
[...]It's not too late to run and[N]
live another day.[A][N]
My sons and I[...] We can hold[N]
them off.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And leave behind a fine man like[N]
yourself, Clarque?[A][N]
There's a heroic sacrifice, and[N]
then there's bein' stupid.[A][N]
Mevion lives and dies on all of[N]
us. We can't run from 'er now.[A][N]
[...]Time to take positions.[N]
See you on the other side.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Of this battle, I mean.[N]
We'll all make it through.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
One can only hope.[A][X]

##Tale1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][CloseEyes]
[...]I fear the end of us all has come.[A][N]
And yet, it is a cause far too gone[N]
to surrender.[A][OpenEyes] To die fighting against[N]
my country is all I deserve.[A][N]
It is all any of us poor fools[N]
deserve now.[A] [...]To arms.[A][X]

Butch's squad is counting on[N]
us four to succeed today.[A][N]
Perhaps you can finally prove[N]
that you're worth a damn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course, father! Today, we shall[N]
conquer like kings![A][N][OpenLeft]
We shall prove that Mevion's[N]

You ready, boss? I'll crush as many[N]
bastards as it takes.[A][N]
Nothin'll get past my axe.[A][N][OpenRight]
Or my lance. See to it that[N]
I'm well compensated later.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
A royal pain of a job deserves[N]
a royal paycheck, after all.[A][N][OpenLeft]
We'll be kings, Peter. We'll have[N]
all the gold we could want.[A][N]
[...]You ready, miss?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Been ready 'alf an hour.[A][N]
Got my healin' stick, my sleepin'[N]
stick, and my beatin' stick.[A][N]
[...]Bit o' a shocker that they let[N]
me have a beatin' stick this nice.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
The revolution needs all they can get.[N]
That's why Butch has his hero's badge.[A][N]
You think 'e earned the honor more than[N]
any o' Mevion's swordsmen?[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Desperate times. Desperate measures.[A][N]
[...]Myrmidon kid.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadRift]
Yes! Sir![A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Sorry you have to be 'ere.[N]
Try 'n stay alive.[A][N][OpenRight]
With all due respect, sir,[N]
I'm leagues beyond our foe![A][N]
Let me at 'em, and they'll be[N]
nothin' but ribbons![A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]If you say so, kid.[A][N]
[...]Onwards, troops! Today is a[N]
glorious day for Mevion![A][N][ToggleSmile]
We are our nation's future![A][X]
