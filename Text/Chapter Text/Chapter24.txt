##C24MasonElcorianTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMason][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I must be off.[N]
I've much to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? You'd rather not watch[N]
the fireworks up close?[A][N]
See that traitor get what's[N]
coming to her?[A][N]
See Lord Tarquin avenged?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, whatever the case, I do[N]
quite appreciate this relic.[A][N]
With it, I shall soar through this[N]
darkness and break the traitors' ranks![A][N]
Those other creations shall do us[N]
much good too.[A] Almost makes one[N]
not need us real humans.[A][N]
Still, that blade you carry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] feel it.[A][N]
The power it holds.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It is but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a ceremonial[N]
implement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, and I'm the king of Holanis.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just saying. No reason to act[N]
like you're above all this.[A][N]
I've heard of your deeds. How your[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
We're back in the Lowlands[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could go never seeing them[N]
for the rest of my life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I couldn't agree more.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't help but notice that[N]
there's been no bandit attacks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps Tarquin drove them off[N]
in the process of marching on us.[A][N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That might mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C24_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Reinforcements? He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] truly wasn't[N]
holding back.[A][N]
But we can't afford to be[N]
caught up in them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Especially since we don't know[N]
how many survived the last battle.[A][N]
If we're not careful, stragglers[N]
could catch up with us.[A][N]
Being pincered in this darkness[N]
could easily spell the end for us.[A][N]
I say our best move is to get out[N]
of here as quickly as possible,[A][N]
before that could ever become an issue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Everyone! Head west![N]
Regroup once we're beyond the dark![A][X]
