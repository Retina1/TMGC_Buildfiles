##Ch13_Mikey_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][OpenMidLeft]
...Pardon me. Are you...[N]
with Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Yes?[N]
Why?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...I'm just curious, is all.[N]
You're not charging at us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Yes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...I feel like we're getting nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look... I'd rather not be here.[N]
Frankly, I... hate the battlefield.[A][N]
But what other choice do I have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does anything say you HAVE[N]
to fight us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I can't just desert.[N]
I'd be throwing away everything.[A][N]
And that's before considering that[N]
my sister'd have my head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you don't wish to fight[N]
us, we can keep you safe.[A][N]
In fact, if you join us, we may[N]
be able to end this war sooner.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd ask me to fight against[N]
my own homeland?[A][N]
...But then again...[A][N]
I've had my doubts about this war.[N]
And for you to risk yourself like this...[A][N]
That's it. I know what I must do.[N]
I'm Mikey. Guide me well.[A][N]
If I must fight at all, I fight[N]
to bring back the Yg'stra I loved.[A][X]

##Ch13_Carbon_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Wait... Is that you, Mikey?[A][N]
...Why're you pointing that[N]
at me?[A] I know you're not much[N]
for this war...[A][N]
But I didn't think it'd send[N]
you off like this![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This isn't right, Carbon.[N]
What Yg'stra's done.[A][N]
I'm going to end this,[N]
on the side of the just.[A][N]
Join me if you wish.[A][N]
Otherwise, I fear we may have[N]
to strike each other down.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...This is serious, isn't it?[A][N]
Well, you're my brother from another.[N]
I'm with you, all the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Thank you, Carbon.[N]
I know we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Besides, if we killed each other here,[N]
I'd never have your cooking again.[A][N]
Your food's to die for.[N]
Not literally, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Glad to see you're taking this[N]
seriously, bud.[A][N]
Just don't sprain yourself[N]
showing off to the new army.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll sprain myself as much[N]
as I wish. It's worth it.[A][X]

##C13ValdenLeavesAmaraAlive
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
They're closer than I had hoped.[A][N]
I think it'd be for the best if I[N]
moved to a position in the palace.[A][N]
Amara![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadAmara]
I understand, General.[N]
I'll hold them back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My thanks. Let's hope your[N]
presence isn't needed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They'll never take me down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Good luck. I'll be[N]
going now.[A][X]

##C13ValdenLeavesAmaraDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden]
They're closer than I had hoped.[A][N]
I think it'd be for the best if I[N]
moved to a position in the palace.[A][N]
It's risky, leaving the throne[N]
unguarded like this...[A][N]
But I think this'll work out[N]
far better in the end.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Emperor... Let us hope you[N]
return to who you once were.[A][X]
