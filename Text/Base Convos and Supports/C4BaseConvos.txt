Things don't look particularly[N]
great for us currently.[A][N]
I recommend we don't stick[N]
around here very long.[A][N]
We're going to want to escape to[N]
the west as soon as possible-[A][N]
every one of us will need[N]
to escape.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, whatever happens, know that[N]
I refuse to leave anyone behind![A][N]
I'll only escape once everyone else[N]
has escaped.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Normally I'd say that your life is[N]
more important here,[A] but I doubt[N]
you'd listen.[A] At least that's quite[N]
virtuous of you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I'll be careful.[N]
We'll all make it out of here alive.[A][X]
