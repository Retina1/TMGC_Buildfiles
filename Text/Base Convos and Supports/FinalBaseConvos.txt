[...]Toddsworth. You don't[N]
want any regrets, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I want those?[N]
They're for losers.[A][N]
[...]Why you askin'?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just making sure. Your music[...][N]
I think it can do wondrous things.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]About that. I[...] I don't think[N]
I'm cut out for that life.[A][N]
I can play a tune like nobody[N]
else, but my words[...][A][N]
They're crass. Coarse. [...]Gods, that[N]
feels wrong to admit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How about I write them?[A][N]
I'm well studied. Well written.[N]
Well spoken.[A] I'm quite sure[N]
I could do your music justice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] you sure? Chaining yourself[N]
to Toddsworth like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I already said I'd transcribe your[N]
work to sheet music.[A] This isn't[N]
all that much more commitment.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right, right.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just[...] overwhelming.[N]
Someone believing in me.[A][N]
[...]God damn it. I'm pathetic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you think that of yourself,[N]
then fight to change that.[A][N]
You're an odd man. But you're[N]
also a good man.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]You[...] mean that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course. You with music,[N]
me the words[...][A][N]
We can make it big.[A][N]
To borrow from your [OpenQuote]crass[CloseQuote][N]
vocabulary,[A] who the fuck[N]
is going to stop us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright. [...]Alright![N]
You[...] You got me excited.[A][N]
The world's our oyster.[A][N]
We'll go down in history.[A][N]
I've[...] never been more sure[N]
of anything in my life.[A][N]
[...]Here's to us![A][X]

##Final_Zeke_Hyperius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Hyperius. I wanted to formally[N]
thank you for everything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is my pride to serve you[N]
along your path.[A][N]
[...]Are you well prepared?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For this battle? I well[N]
and truly hope so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not just for today. We will[N]
overcome Arbordia.[A][N]
I am certain of that.[A][N]
I speak of what comes after[N]
this battle.[A] Are you[N]
ready for the world to change?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] I don't know.[A][N]
[...]I don't think I'll be[...][N]
the king Elba Cor needs.[A][N]
[...]I don't know if anyone[N]
could ever be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I trust in your ability.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Many do. And that's part of[N]
the problem.[A] I've hardly[...][N]
earned your respect as king.[A][N]
And yet you and others will[N]
sing my praises.[A][N]
This isn't anything against[N]
you, Hyperius.[A][N]
But I[...][A][CloseEyes] I need more time[N]
to think about this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You've brought up similar[N]
concerns before.[A][N]
[...]Are[...] you certain you[N]
wish to take the throne?[A][N]
[...]No, let me rephrase that.[N]
Do you wish to take the throne?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Deep down[...] I[...][N]
don't think I truly do.[A][N]
[...]I think Elba Cor should[N]
be for the people.[A][N]
By the people.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]An admirable notion.[A][N]
[...]If you wish to be the one[N]
to bring upon that change,[A][N]
I shall guide your hand as[N]
I oft have.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You[...] You will? Even if it[N]
ends the monarchy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am a man dedicated to you[N]
and your father.[A][N]
Whatever path you choose,[N]
I shall support it.[A][N]
[...]All this said, it's likely[N]
you'd have to take the throne,[A][N]
if you wish to ultimately[N]
bring an end to it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] understand. [...]I know this[N]
is a lot. Especially now.[A][N]
But[...] Thank you for[N]
hearing me out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anything, Your Highness.[A][N]
Naturally, though, we must first[N]
triumph in today's battle.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Let us march unto victory![A][X]
