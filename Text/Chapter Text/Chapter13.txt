What a surprise![A][N]
I'm Dalstian too. Name's Gaylord.[N]

##Ch13_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden][OpenMidRight][LoadAmara]
Commander. It appears we've a[N]
small enemy force drawing near.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Unless[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's the problem?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I recieved word that the Opistians[N]
launched an all-out assault.[A][N]
Except on the Elba Corian front.[A][N]
Was it naught but a diversion, perhaps?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've relatively few left here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And? There's hardly a chance the capital'll[N]
be lost when we're here to defend it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even so, we cannot afford to underestimate[N]
our foes for even a moment.[A][N]
Rally whatever troops remain in the city.[A][N]
Have them strike as the enemy[N]
advances up the cliffs.[A][N]
I'll keep a legion within the palace[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Just in case it comes to that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, Valden. What shall I do?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just stand guard. If the need arises,[N]
take over the gate for me.[A][N]
You're quite capable, Amara.[N]
If it comes to it, I trust you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, Commander.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
First, Lazarus, and now this.[A][N]
Let us hope this invasion comes[N]
to a swift end today.[A][X]

Eyes up, pal. Looks like it's[N]
about to all go down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look. I know how you feel. But[N]
this is what we all gotta do.[A][N]
If you really don't want to fight,[N]
just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] stand in place.[A][N]
Pretend to move your lance.[A][N]
Anyway, I gotta head up to my position.[N]
I'll be rushing back down soon enough.[A][N]

there, Mikey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

##Ch13_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
We're about to enter the capital.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
There's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite a lot of cliffs.[N]
And I think I see some ballistae.[A][N]
This won't be easy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's any consolation, this is[N]
a mere fraction of their forces.[A][N]
Most of the Yg'stran army is in Elba Cor.[N]
And even if they were to be recalled now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They'd have to fight through the[N]
Opistian army.[A] We'd have plenty of[N]
time to take the city.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. We'll make for the palace[N]
and establish a foothold around it.[A][N]
Once we're there, we'll make for[N]
the emperor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hadn't thought of this until now,[N]
but will we have to kill the emperor?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I honestly don't know.[A][N]
Hopefully we won't have to fight him,[N]
but we'll do what we must to end this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. It's too early[N]
to worry about that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Of course. For now, our goal is clear.[A][N]
By the by, there's some districts among[N]
the cliffs.[A] Perhaps some civilians[N]
wish for this war to end too.[A][N]
In that case, it may be worth[N]
attempting to reason with them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]On my command.[A][X]

Beyond these gates lie the emperor.[N]
We've all the time we need to prepare.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No point in holding off[N]
any longer. It's time to end this war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We're behind you all the way.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon me. Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
with Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes?[N]
Why?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm just curious, is all.[N]
You're not charging at us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel like we're getting nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'd rather not be here.[N]
Frankly, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hate the battlefield.[A][N]
But what other choice do I have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does anything say you HAVE[N]
to fight us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I can't just desert.[N]
I'd be throwing away everything.[A][N]
And that's before considering that[N]
my sister'd have my head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you don't wish to fight[N]
us, we can keep you safe.[A][N]
In fact, if you join us, we may[N]
be able to end this war sooner.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd ask me to fight against[N]
my own homeland?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But then again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've had my doubts about this war.[N]
And for you to risk yourself like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That's it. I know what I must do.[N]
I'm Mikey. Guide me well.[A][N]
If I must fight at all, I fight[N]

you off like this![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This isn't right, Carbon.[N]
What Yg'stra's done.[A][N]
I'm going to end this,[N]
on the side of the just.[A][N]

Otherwise, I fear we may have[N]
to strike each other down.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

I know we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Besides, if we killed each other here,[N]
I'd never have your cooking again.[A][N]
Your food's to die for.[N]

Glad to see you're taking this[N]
seriously, bud.[A][N]

I'm sorry for throwing this horse[N]

Some captured supplies got delivered to[N]

As you've surely noticed, we've lots[N]
of artillery in Yg'stra.[A][N]
Between it and our cliffs, we're nigh[N]
impossible to invade![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I said nigh. Exceptions happen.[A][N]
Anyway, imagine if you could outrange[N]
those ballistae![A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can't, but this'll give[N]

Blame my squad leader.[A][N]
The way the dastard ran things[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, I don't know why I stayed.[A][N]
There's this merc group I've heard good[N]
things about. Gonna try and join 'em.[A][N]
If you run into the Viridian Mercenaries,[N]
don't be surprised to hear tales of Callum.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No? You're trying to keep[N]
us out of harm's way?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was not expecting that.[N]
Guess what we've heard was wrong.[A][N]
Well, in that case, do what you must.[N]
Bring this war to an end.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell anyone about this.[A][X]

You're as pristine as I remember[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
They even left my banner lance[N]

Are you looking to get stronger?[N]
Well, I've a good idea for you.[A][N]
See that arena over there? Bloodsport[N]
can be quite enriching![A][N]
Hell, I don't just mean character growth.[N]
It'll richen your pockets too.[A][N]
Just know that it's do-or-die in there.[N]
Emphasis on the die.[A][N]
They import special weapons that're[N]
massively destructive, yet lightweight.[A][N]
Guess that combination makes for[N]
good entertainment.[A][N]
Supposedly, they also draw in combatants[N]
from all walks of life.[A][N]
Who knows? You might see nobility in there.[N]
Hell! The prince of a nation, for all I know.[A][N]
The arena's a lovely place, I say.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadKid1]
I was playin' by the palace once,[N]
and you won't believe what I saw![A][N]
There, shining in the moat's waterfall,[N]
was a beautiful door![A][N]
It looked like a shop beyond my wildest[N]
dreams! I swear I saw it! Pinky swear![A][N]

##C13House3Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan2]
I heard the Elba Corian offense is being[N]

She's the pride of Yg'stra's army[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And a beaut beyond compare, to boot![A][N]
Of course, Joan's nothing to scoff at, either![N]
She's an ace with a sword or an axe.[A][N]
The two of them make quite the team[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I heard they're pals with[N]
the legendary Tobias[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
If that's true[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Imagine all[N]

Recently, I was pacing near the palace,[N]
and I thought I saw a dreadful sight.[A][N]
Words fail to describe it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It was like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a demon.[A][N]
But it was also[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] strangely beautiful?[N]
Beyond any of our imaginations.[A][N]
Why would it have been at the palace?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sure it was nothing.[A][N]
Nothing but my weary mind.[A][X]

##C13House5Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
My luck is just the worst.[A][N]
Notice anything about my house?[N]
Like what it's next to?[A][N]
I'm a responsible Yg'stran citizen,[N]
yet I've a barricade adjacent to me![A][N]
What if that thing breaks? It'll fall[N]
right on my house! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Probably.[A][N]
Even if it doesn't, I feel slighted.[A][N]
And don't get me started on it blocking[N]
my morning walk's path.[A][X]

##C13House6Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
That guy over there? Next to the wall?[N]
He's overreacting.[A][N]
The wall's fine. It won't crash[N]
into his house if it falls.[A][N]
And honestly? I think it has charm.[N]
Character. Class, even.[A][N]
Frankly, I'm envious. At least[N]
I can look at it.[A][X]

##C13House7Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan5]
So, let's say, hypothetically, you're[N]
trying to invade Yg'stra.[A][N]
You'll want to be mindful of where you step.[N]
There's carefully coordinated defense zones.[A][N]
By talking to me now, you're in one.[N]
Keep on your guard for reinforcements.[A][N]
From what I've heard, the other zone is[N]
