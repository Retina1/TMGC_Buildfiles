##Tale6Opening
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond][OpenLeft]
[...]I still can't believe this.[A][N]
Everything was going well.[N]
Dalst was stable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And it shall remain, Kenneth.[A][N]
We've fought through Girard's[N]
machinations once.[A][N]
These remnants of his shall[N]
fall just the same.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Still, to think that there'd be[N]
still more simulacra around.[A][N]
[...]Disgraceful. When'll the dead[N]
stay where they belong?[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadStefan]
Sir! Enemy forces have been[N]
sighted straight ahead![A][N]
It appears they're being led by[N]
several Lady Ciraweisses![A][N]
[...]Ciraweii?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[...] just like back in[N]
Aercolyn, Kenneth![A][N][OpenLeft]
Hmph. We've struck her down[N]
several times now.[A][N]
This won't be an issue.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadPtolemy]
Um[...] Sorry to interrupt, but[N]
I saw a few more commanders.[A][N]
[...]It appears your father's[N]
off in the distance.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Even better.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadEmile]
Did[...] Did they have a contingency[N]
in place?[A] Snatch back Dalst with[N]
its great leaders?[A][N][OpenLeft]
And yet, they didn't think to[N]
replicate their own forms.[A][N]
To me, it sounds that they threw[N]
away other lives,[A] while thinking[N]
they'd walk away unscathed.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadJosef]
Whatever the case, our goal now's[N]
clear as day.[A] [...]Bring 'em down.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadNatasia]
Gotta say, I appreciate you askin'[N]
me for a hand.[A] No, really.[A][N]
I've been itchin' to show off[N]
a little more.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'd hardly call this [OpenQuote]showing off,[CloseQuote][N]
but if it helps, sure.[A][N]
I appreciate all of you lending[N]
your might to this, incidentally.[A][N]
We've still some in our forces[N]
fiercely loyal to[...] him.[A][N]
Evidently.[A] [...]We'll bring sense[N]
to them. And to Dalst.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadJohan]
We shall, sir.[N]
Just show us the way.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadGaylord]
Mmm[...] Yep. Let's wrap 'er up[N]
in time for a nice rest.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Gladly. Our plan's simple.[A][N]
The Ciraweii have staked out three[N]
keeps in this vicinity.[A][N]
If we reclaim them all, that's our[N]
foothold to reclaim control.[A][N]
[...]March, troops! Let's show Dalst[N]
our force of will![A][X]

##Tale6Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenLeft]
That's that. [...]It still repulses me[N]
that so many cling to the dead.[A][N]
[...]Girard spoke so often of some[N]
manner of future.[A][N]
But his future was always chained[N]
to the past.[A] To some mad delusions[N]
that clung to him like a parasite.[A][N]
The more I read of the records he[N]
left, the more I[...][A] Well, I[N]
wouldn't say pity him.[A][N]
Or understand him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Whatever the case may be,[N]
however you feel about him,[A][N]
it's like you said. All in[N]
the past, now.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What did everyone say the day[N]
we all won?[A] The future's now[N]
ours to create?[A][N][OpenLeft]
All correct. I truly do hate to[N]
get caught up in his legacy.[A][N]
It's just frustrating that it[N]
continues to stand in our way.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]That's just what he left us.[A][N]
Tearing it apart will never get any[N]
easier.[A][OpenEyes] But it shall make the land[N]
we create all the more triumphant.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Well. We've triumphed for today.[A][N]
Let us take this victory, and let it[N]
form the backbone of our future.[A][X]


##Tale6FirstSeize
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
That's the first stronghold down.[N]
Two more to go. Not bad at all.[A][X]
##Tale6SecondSeize
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
That's the second stronghold down.[N]
One more to go. Let's finish strong.[A][X]
##Tale6ThirdSeize
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...]And that's all of them.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
A decisive victory for the[N]
Dalstian Alliance.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadKenneth]
[...]Figured this'd happen.[A][N]
If that rat made an army[N]
of Ciraweisses,[A] of course[N]
he'd make more of you.[A][N]
[...]Let's make this quick.[A][N]
You and I both know this only[N]
ends one way. Farewell.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadKenneth]
Lamentable as always, Ethyl.[A][N]
No power in this world will[N]
let you match our might.[A][N]
Even when you were alive,[N]
you were nothing to us.[A][N]
And now, you're but dust[N]
unto the wind.[A][N]
[...]Scatter.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinDesmondBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadDesmond]
Tarquin. You still haunt this[N]
nation, even now?[A][N]
[...]I shall strike you down.[A][N]
For the true justice you[N]
might've once stood for.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylDesmondBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadDesmond]
Lady Ciraweiss.[A][N]
[...]I shan't hold back my[N]
righteous fury any longer.[A][N]
Whether you see this to[N]
be mercy or punishment,[A][N]
let this be your end.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadJohan]
[...]Commander Neillstrom.[N]
For your part in everything,[A][N]
I shall strike down your[N]
last remnants. Farewell.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadJohan][CloseEyes]
[...]Fall. Suffer.[N]
Like we have.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadPtolemy]
You're[...] Kenneth's father?[A][N]
Again? [...]Those horrible deeds[N]
still haunt this land?[A][N]
[...]Please[...] Please stop.[N]
This helps none of us.[A][N]
[...]I'll stop you, then.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadPtolemy][CloseEyes]
[...]You can't hurt us anymore.[A][N]
I'll[...] make sure of that.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadEmile]
[...]Had they truly prepared[N]
for this?[A] Tarquin's fall?[N]
The fall of all Dalst?[A][N]
Did[...] Did they think a husk[N]
like this could lead?[A][N]
[...]Detestable.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadEmile]
[...]I've[...] read what remains[N]
of their notes.[A] The fall that[N]
drove them all those years.[A][N]
You[...] you were always there.[A][N]
[...]Another complicit in[N]
the shadows of our land.[A][X]

##Tale6TarquinNatasiaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadNatasia]
You're still fightin' your[N]
son's vision, old man?[A][N]
Lotta nerve. No brains.[N]
Good news, though.[A][N]
No brains means you won't[N]
feel a thing.[A][X]

##Tale6EthylNatasiaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleInvert][LoadNatasia]
Never knew ya, Ciraweiss.[A][N]
[...]From what I heard, I'm glad[N]
I've kept it that way.[A][N]
And that everybody else'll[N]
keep it that way, too.[A][X]
