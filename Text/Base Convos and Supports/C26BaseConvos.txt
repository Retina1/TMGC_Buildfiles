Whew[...] You ever gonna[N]
retire from this, bud?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not as long as I can keep[N]
makin' a killing.[A][N]
I quite like money a lot.[N]
Better than not, I say.[A][N]
And I'm damn good at finding[N]
myself with lots of it.[A][N]
Maybe one day I'll have myself[N]
some cushy retirement fund.[A][N]
But then again, Darahan 'ere[N]
eats like a monarch.[A][N]
Wyverns ain't cheap.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Guess so. All I need're[N]
leather scraps and a blade.[A][N]
[...]Haven't thought about that[N]
whole savin' thing, though.[A][N]
So who knows. I may be further[N]
from peace than you'll ever be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worst case, you got a brother[N]
with a cushy business.[A][N]
Me, though? I'm my only cushion.[N]
Gotta keep on keepin' on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know I'd let a bud like[N]
you stay with me if you gotta.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be fine. But thanks, pal.[N]
[...]Onto the field, then.[A][N]
Gotta work for our retirement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Course. I can still show[N]
'em all we mean business.[A][X]

Why're ye cozyin' up to me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Guh? I'm just a silly[N]
creature, Holly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Where I'm from, Yuyu,[N]
nothin' lke that is free.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. Well, we're not in[N]
the Lowlands anymore.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
My antics are one hundred[N]
percent free of charge.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You[...] You can trust me.[A][N]
I've[...] been alone before.[N]
i don't want you to feel like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...][A][CloseEyes] I appreciate it.[N]
I do.[A] [...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've got an idea.[N]
Let's crush some bastards.[A][N]
That'll brighten your spirits.[N]
[...]Or maybe just mine.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Always up for some crushin'.[A][N]
Sorry for gettin' a bit out[N]
there, Yuyu.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
All good, Holly. Just tryin'[N]
to keep our spirits up.[A][N]
If you ever need something,[N]
look for me.[A][N]
[...]Or for two identical copies[N]
of the same person.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Duly noted.[A][X]

Mister! Where[...][N]

[...]Never been a sentiment guy,[N]
but[...] You've done good, kid.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Wantin' to be a hero,[N]
saving people.[A][N]
You're[...] You're already[N]
an expert, kid.[A][N][OpenEyes]
And now[...] I want to try[N]
givin' some good back.[A][N]
[...]Thanks for everything, hero.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

I see you've recovered your sword.[A][N]
[...]And I'm certain you didn't have the[N]
time to go for a swim in the Lowlands.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The storge betwixt [Tact] and I can[N]
shatter any of your illusions, witch.[A][N]
And now, [Tact] shall end you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Now, why ever would you do that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I will not fall for any[N]
of your ruses, Georgios![A][N]
You think to distract me[N]
with a poisoned tongue?[A][N]
Fine, then. Keep to your[N]
unending trail of false hopes.[A][N]
Let them comfort you as [Tact][N]
delivers you unto oblivion![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Well.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Don't give me that look![N]
[...]Why[...] are you like this?[A][N]
Why does [Tact] waver?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Simple.[A][OpenEyes] You don't want[N]
to actually kill me.[A][N]
Can't say I don't appreciate it.[A][N]
[...]Look at it this way. Sure,[N]
I might've deceived you.[A][N]
But it awoke in you a new power.[N]
Ends justify means, and all that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Do those ends justify those[N]
long years, witch?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A]Can't say they do.[N]
Too late for you, though.[A][X]
