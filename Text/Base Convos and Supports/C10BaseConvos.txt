'Ey, cap'n. I just...[N]
wanted to thank ye.[A][N]
Fer givin' me another chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do ye mean, lad?[N]
I didn't choose ye.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I know. But still...[A][N]
In the short time I've known[N]
yer crew, it's...[A][N]
Well, it's been wonderful.[A][N]
Na' to speak ill o' Pete,[N]
but 'e was a bastard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, 'e was. Him and I go way back.[N]
A good pirate, but nae a [OpenQuote]good[CloseQuote] pirate.[A][N]
That be somethin' I've learned.[A][N]
There's a difference between a righteous[N]
freedom an' a ruthless chaos.[A][N]
I'll admit, lad. I 'ave done many[N]
terrible things in my day.[A][N]
But then, I realized... It don't[N]
have to be that way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I think... I see what ye mean.[A][N]
This life be our birthright, yet we[N]
don't hafta live in its shadow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why Pete ne'er became more[N]
than what he was.[A] The man clung[N]
to dreams o' a bygone age.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...I'm glad to be 'ere. To have[N]
a chance to do some good.[A][N]
...Cap'n. Take this gem, and[N]
give it to someone important.[A][N]
It's 'ardly anythin', but it'll do[N]
the others more good than it'd do me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, lad. Yer a fine man.[N]
Perhaps one day this crew'll be yers.[A][X]

...Well. What do you want?[N]
Come to laugh in a sinner's face?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I beg your pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't give me that. I know your type.[N]
...I've robbed your type blind.[A][N]
You think you're high and mighty[N]
for servin' some king.[A][N]
That you have some sort of moral[N]
authority from which to judge me.[A][N]
Well, I'm an irredeemable wretch![N]
What will you do about it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...That's... not quite[N]
what I came for.[A][N]
I just thought you an appropriate[N]
partner to train with,[A] given[N]
how swift we are.[A][N]
But do you really think all[N]
of us are like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you serve someone higher than yourself,[N]
you're betraying human nature.[A][N]
And in the name of what, may I ask?[A][N]
I may be scum, but at least[N]
I serve nobody but myself.[A][N]
At least I'm not perpetuating[N]
society's lies.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Would it be remiss to mention[N]
that you're serving this army?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And now I'm being made out as a[N]
god damned hypocrite.[A][N]
...I mean, I AM one, but the whole[N]
point of being one is NOT admitting it![A][N]
...I hope you're happy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
...What did I just listen to?[A][N]
He's wrong, anyway. Our king is a just man.[N]
Serving him is a brilliant purpose.[A][X]

...Hm... What if I try a reinforced[N]
shaft... Wait, that wouldn't work...[A][N]
Flexibility's still a must, after all...[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight]
Accursed Ciraweissian wood...[N]
Too pliable for its own good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Hello?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wha-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
S-sorry, sorry! Did I[N]
i-interupt you...?[A][N]
I'll j-just go now...[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
It's alright.[N]
...Sam? Where'd you go?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...I'm here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Well, what did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I j-just noticed you deep in thought.[N]
What's that sketch, there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm trying to figure out a design[N]
for this staff prototype.[A][N]
The problem is this particular staff's[N]
magic is... quite rigorous.[A][N]
Our first attempt at harnessing it[N]
violently shattered its shaft.[A][N][CloseEyes]
...Frankly, I still might have[N]
a splinter or two from that.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out[N]
a way to avoid that.[A][N]
As you might've overheard, Ciraweissian[N]
wood has failed me.[A][N]
...Out of curiousity, what's your[N]
bow made out of?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I... don't quite know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. If it's not any trouble,[N]
I wouldn't mind having a look at it.[A][N]
After all, for it to retain its shape[N]
after being repeatedly fired...[A][N]
Hm... This might be the inspiration[N]
I need.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really? It'd help that much?[N]
I'm glad to hear that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This could lead to a breakthrough![A][N]
You can be a bit more enthusiatic[N]
than that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
S-sorry...[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...No need to apologize.[N]
Again.[A][X]
