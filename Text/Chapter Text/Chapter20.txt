##Arc2Ending
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The mysteries of Holanis's fall[N]
have all been laid bare.[A][N]
Before Blair and Zeke awaits[N]
an uncertain future,[A][N]
against a foe with untold amounts[N]
of power at their disposal.[A][N]
To even the odds, they seek[N]
the assistance of mercenaries.[A][N]
Even so, will they prove a match[N]
for the shadows entangling Ulmaron?[A][N]
Only time can tell.[A][N]
But before that, yet another[N]
story must be told.[A][N]
A story of the selfless.[A][N]
A story of brave souls diving headfirst[N]
into fate. The story... of Viridian.[A][X]

##BrandlLetter
My son... I hope this letter[N]
finds you well.[A] It brings[N]
me great sorrow,[A] knowing how[N]
short our time was cut.[A][N]
And yet, I knew I must let you[N]
off to settle your doubts.[A][N]
In the chaos, I forgot to present[N]
you what I had for so long cherished.[A][N]
It is a humble charm your mother[N]
had given me when we were wed.[A][N]
Your mother passed shortly after[N]
your birth, as you may recall.[A][N]
She was a noble and resolute warrior.[N]
And she'd... be proud of you.[A][N]
Proud as I am.[A][N]
Wear this charm, and remember who[N]
you are.[A] You are the future[N]
of our great Elba Cor.[A][X]

He apologizes for not being[N]
of adequate assistance.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Hardly. Him doing this is[...][N]
more than enough for me.[A][N]
Let's see, here. A tome.[N]
For you, Blair, I'd presume.[A][N]
A pair of lances.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
In your right hand is the Stalwart.[N]
A lance of unmoving conviction.[A][N]
And in your left is the kingdom's[N]
most prized treasure.[A][N]
The Nuiusseon. One of the finest[N]
weapons on the continent,[A][N]
and material proof of the first[N]
king's will.[A][N]
As for the tome, I know little of it.[A][N]
But I believe someone named Elcorian[N]
sent it for you, milady.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]He left a note in the cover.[N]
This spell[...] It's named Waning.[A][N]
He says it draws from my[N]
determination.[A][N]
[...]He's too kind.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
The king also sent this.[A][N]
A keepsake, and proof of[N]
your bloodline.[A][N]
[...]I believe his letter may[N]
explain its significance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thank you. Tell Father I'm[...][N]
well. And that I'll be alright.[A][N]
I'll read his letter tonight.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. Is there anything[N]
else you'd like me to tell him?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Tell him thanks.[A][N]
For[...] everything.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Is that all? I can do that.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Are you still sure about this,[N]
Zeke?[A] You can still leave this all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Absolutely not. I've come this far.[N]
I'll not abandon all this.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Figured you'd say that.[N]
[...]I don't think we need anything else.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Safe travels, milady.[N]
Safe travels, Your Highness.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]We[...] must go.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Alright. We'll prepare on[N]
the road.[A][N]
[...]Let's hope that we'll[N]
be enough.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]This diversion[...] Please tell[N]
me it'll have been worth it.[A][X]

[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenFarFarRight][LoadArbordia][OpenFarFarLeft]
[...]Ah, Girard. I was[...] digging around,[N]
and I found some of your old notes.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
So you have. Forget that rubbish.[N]
'Twas but a fleeting dream.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
That's what I had thought, but the[N]
concept had stuck with me[...][A][N]
And I had to refine it.[A] [...]Have a look.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]Wait[...] You solved the problem?[N]
This is[...] This is amazing![A][N]
To think we can go beyond mere Simulacrums[...][N]
Creating genuine life from the departed![A][N]
This will change the world. I'm certain.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
It's[...] not without its flaws.[N]
But it's a start.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
You undersell yourself, friend. With this,[N]
our glorious future is finally within reach![A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
You[...] honor me, Girard. Are[...] you[N]
quite sure this is right, though?[A][N]
There's some not quite noble implications[N]
to this whole[...] procedure.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
That there may be, but all shall be[N]
worth it. [...]You'll see.[A][N]
And your name may perhaps go down[N]
in history.[A] The man who brought[N]
salvation unto mankind.[A][N]
[...]Elcorian.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[...]Of course, Girard.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArbordia][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
This'll all be worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]In any case, I must be off.[N]
There is much to be done.[A][X]
