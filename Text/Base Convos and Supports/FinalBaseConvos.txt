[...]It's almost over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is. Do[...] you think[N]
we'll make a difference?[A][N]
I just sometimes fear to think[...][N]
What if this all means nothing?[A][N]
What if tomorrow, there's another[N]
existential threat like Girard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then we'll triumph over them.[N]
We've come too far to not.[A][N]
And we've clearly proven our[N]
ability to overcome trials.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right. I'm just[...][N]
I worry too much.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing's wrong with that.[A][N]
We're all concerned over what[N]
the future will bring.[A][N]
[...]We just have to bravely step[N]
ahead into it anyway.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I know that we can make[N]
whatever future we wish for.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]We can. [...]Thanks for[...][N]
Well, everything, really.[A][N]
Your leadership, your might[...][N]
Most of all, for being a friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Zeke. We're stronger[N]
than the sum of our parts.[A][N]
And that strength is from[N]
the bond we share.[A][N]
Together, we'll carve a[N]
path to tomorrow![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha[...] That we will.[A][X]

##Final_Sam_Charley_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley][OpenMidLeft]
Charley. I've[...] made up my mind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
About your birthright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I don't wish to claim it.[A][N]
I've realized how much I admire[N]
you and your freedom.[A][N]
I don't want to give that up if[N]
I have the chance to take it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A respectable choice.[A][N]
I'm guessing from how you[N]
phrased that,[A] you intend[N]
to stick with me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If that's alright with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course. You're a pleasure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]T-Thanks.[A][N]
[...]Could[...] Could I be[N]
even more than that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What[...] do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] make me want to be better.[N]
Stronger. More confident.[A][N]
[...]I[...] I want to be more than[N]
just friends with you, Charley.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh. [...]Oh.[A][N]
Well, I'd be more than[N]
happy to oblige.[A][N]
You're[...] quite dear to me[N]
as well.[A] I hadn't imagined[N]
in a romantic sense,[A][N]
but the more I think on it[...][A][N]
The more it feels right.[A][N]
[...]You and I. Yeah.[N]
I like that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad.[A][N]
And I[...] I never want[N]
tihs moment to end.[A][X]

##Final_Ptolemy_Johan_Base

We're[...] finally at the end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Soon[...] we can finally rest.[A][N]
[...]Where do you plan to go?[N]
Back to Holanis, I presume?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I was thinking I'd go[N]
wherever you went.[A][N]
If[...] that's alright[N]
with you, I mean.[A][N]
I wouldn't wanna be[N]
a bother to you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You could never bother me,[N]
Ptolemy.[A] You're one of[N]
the kindest people I know.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You've[...] made this all[N]
worth surviving.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Me? I'm hardly[...] that much.[A][N]
[...]Your resilience inspired me[N]
too. Back in Jraeyan.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It[...] wasn't easy. But I knew that[N]
if you could hold out hope[...][A][N]
Then surely I could.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
That's why I[...] I don't[N]
want to leave you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I never want to leave[N]
your side, either.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You're[...] You're my light.[N]

##Final_Josef_Athena_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJosef][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena][OpenMidLeft]
Athena. Mind if I ask your[N]
plans for after this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hardly had anything exciting.[A][N]
Will probably just return to[N]
business as normal in Opistia.[A][N]
[...]And you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, that's the challenge.[A][N]
Thought I'd just wanna get back[N]
to life in Dalst,[A] but it's[N]
not quite that simple now.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indecision doesn't suit you.[N]
Tell me what's the matter.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, about that. It's[...] you.[N]
You simply won't leave my mind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Ah. I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I know I'd regret it the rest of my[N]
life,[A] if we went our separate paths[N]
without me saying anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][ToggleSmile]Alright. Come to Opistia, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Wait[...] Huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
If you think you'll regret not[N]
acting on any feelings,[A][N]
then act on them. We'll see[N]
where they take us.[A][N]
[...]You've a fascinating man, Josef.[N]
I've grown fond of you myself.[A][N]
Why don't we see if there's[N]
anything more between us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If[...] If you're sure, I'd[...][N]
I'd truly appreciate that chance.[A][N]
I think we'll be right for[N]
each other. [...]I hope.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've made it this far.[N]
You're doing something well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I guess I am.[A][N]
[...]Ah! Of course, before[N]
any talk of life together[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
We must triumph.[N]
And we shall.[A][X]

##Final_Charley_Toddsworth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCharley][OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Toddsworth. You don't[N]
want any regrets, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I want those?[N]
They're for losers.[A][N]
[...]Why you askin'?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just making sure. Your music[...][N]
I think it can do wondrous things.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]About that. I[...] I don't think[N]
I'm cut out for that life.[A][N]
I can play a tune like nobody[N]
else, but my words[...][A][N]
They're crass. Coarse. [...]Gods, that[N]
feels wrong to admit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How about I write them?[A][N]
I'm well studied. Well written.[N]
Well spoken.[A] I'm quite sure[N]
I could do your music justice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] you sure? Chaining yourself[N]
to Toddsworth like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I already said I'd transcribe your[N]
work to sheet music.[A] This isn't[N]
all that much more commitment.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right, right.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just[...] overwhelming.[N]
Someone believing in me.[A][N]
[...]God damn it. I'm pathetic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you think that of yourself,[N]
then fight to change that.[A][N]
You're an odd man. But you're[N]
also a good man.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]You[...] mean that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course. You with music,[N]
me the words[...][A][N]
We can make it big.[A][N]
To borrow from your [OpenQuote]crass[CloseQuote][N]
vocabulary,[A] who the fuck[N]
is going to stop us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright. [...]Alright![N]
You[...] You got me excited.[A][N]
The world's our oyster.[A][N]
We'll go down in history.[A][N]
I know I said that before, but[N]
I[...] really mean it now.[A][N]
I've[...] never been more sure[N]
of anything in my life.[A][N]
[...]Here's to us![A][X]

##Final_Zeke_Hyperius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Hyperius. I wanted to formally[N]
thank you for everything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is my pride to serve you[N]
along your path.[A][N]
[...]Are you well prepared?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For this battle? I well[N]
and truly hope so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not just for today. We will[N]
overcome Arbordia.[A][N]
I am certain of that.[A][N]
I speak of what comes after[N]
this battle.[A] Are you[N]
ready for the world to change?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] I don't know.[A][N]
[...]I don't think I'll be[...][N]
the king Elba Cor needs.[A][N]
[...]I don't know if anyone[N]
could ever be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I trust in your ability.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Many do. And that's part of[N]
the problem.[A] I've hardly[...][N]
earned your respect as king.[A][N]
And yet you and others will[N]
sing my praises.[A][N]
This isn't anything against[N]
you, Hyperius.[A][N]
But I[...][A][CloseEyes] I need more time[N]
to think about this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You've brought up similar[N]
concerns before.[A][N]
[...]Are[...] you certain you[N]
wish to take the throne?[A][N]
[...]No, let me rephrase that.[N]
Do you wish to take the throne?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Deep down[...] I[...][N]
don't think I truly do.[A][N]
[...]I think Elba Cor should[N]
be for the people.[A][N]
By the people.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]An admirable notion.[A][N]
[...]If you wish to be the one[N]
to bring upon that change,[A][N]
I shall guide your hand as[N]
I oft have.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You[...] You will? Even if it[N]
ends the monarchy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am a man dedicated to you[N]
and your father.[A][N]
Whatever path you choose,[N]
I shall support it.[A][N]
[...]All this said, it's likely[N]
you'd have to take the throne,[A][N]
if you wish to ultimately[N]
bring an end to it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] understand. [...]I know this[N]
is a lot. Especially now.[A][N]
But[...] Thank you for[N]
hearing me out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anything, Your Highness.[A][N]
Naturally, though, we must first[N]
triumph in today's battle.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Let us march unto victory![A][X]
