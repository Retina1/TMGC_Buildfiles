@mov r11, r11 
@ #0x00 - noop (does not trigger range events) 
@ #0x01 - attacks target? but since I have no target it just crashes the game 
@ #0x02 - moved two tiles to the left 
@ #0x03 - gold was stolen 
@ #0x04 - the village was destroyed 
@ #0x05 - wait, I guess? it ran the range event, which is good enough for me

@ breaks once per enemy with this AI, so perfect 
@ but doesn't actually 'wait' at the spot, so it doesn't trigger range events.. 
@ so we manually trigger them now 
@ but first, let's put the active unit's coord into sB and their unit id in s2

@ Tried invoking the EventEngine and it didn't work
@ so it's running this 3x then running the event 3x 
@ when it runs the event 3x, the current unit is the same for all 3 hmm
