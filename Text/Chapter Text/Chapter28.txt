What is this[...] horrible presence?[A][N]
[...]Are those[...] Ciraweiss? Those tomes[...][N]
No[...] It can't be[...][A][X]

##C28Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
This place is[...][N]
Well, it's huge.[A][N]
Any idea where Arbordia[N]
and Elcorian may be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've got no clue. But we have[N]
the perimeter surrounded.[A][N]
Unless they can warp outside,[N]
there's nowhere they can run.[A][N]
[...]And if they do warp away,[N]
we can prepare for their return.[A][N]
For now, let's make our way up the[N]
hall.[A] [...]Be ready for anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right behind you.[N]
All the way.[A][X]

##C28Opening2

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlank][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][ToggleInvert][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]I believe you may be[N]
familiar with this one.[A][N]
Their entire group has proven[N]
to be very worthy subjects.[A][N]
Proof of my concept.[A][N]
But you've proven yourselves[N]
hardly into my rigor.[A][N]
[...]In any case, none of this[N]
matters.[A] My duty is to hold[N]
you off for Girard.[A][N]
Every moment you spend here[N]
brings him further away.[A][N]
[...]If you turn back, so be it.[N]
But if you intend to advance[...][A][N]
I[...] We will hold back nothing.[A][N]
[...]The first move is yours.[N]
Make your choice.[A][N]
Just know that your time is[N]
slipping away fast.[A][X]

##C28Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So this is[...] I'm[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[...] haven't done anything.[N]
None of this is your fault.[A][N]
[...]All we can do now is[N]
bring end to their sorrow.[A][N]
[...]And to Elcorian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
write more later thanks[A][X]

##C28Turn1
[OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]So, you choose to fight.[N]
Regrettable, truly.[A][N]
Treasure what little time[N]
you have left.[A][N]
And know that what is about to[N]
happen to you is your doing.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
I[...] do not regret my choices.[A][N]
The sins I've committed are all[N]
in the name of the future.[A][N]
If you deny this future,[N]
there can be no parley.[A][N]
[...]Come, then. Let our[N]
ideals clash.[A][X]

##C28ElcorianBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]This is for everything.[N]
Your good. Your evil.[A][N]
Everything you've given.[N]
Everything you've taken.[A][N]
This is exactly what you've[N]
come to deserve, Elcorian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Then prove it to me.[A][N]
Prove that you have the[N]
will to forge your path.[A][N]
[...]To bring an end to mine.[A][X]

##KennethWoundsElcorian
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian]
[...]Urgh[...] Why aren't[...][N]
you killing me[...]?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I simply think you'll[N]
be a valuable asset.[A][N]
Perhaps you wished to die[N]
here instead.[A][N]
Perhaps you'll wish you[N]
died here.[A][N]
[...]But there will be no[N]
escaping justice.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...]Your sorrow will not[N]
move me.[A] Now, begone.[A][N]
We still have to clean[N]
up the rest of your mess.[A][X]

Not sure of that myself.[A][N]
But I'm sure I'll find a[N]
use for you.[A][N]
And if not, I'll gladly[N]
finish what I started.[A][N]
[...]Never forget that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]

##Ch28_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungElcorian][OpenMidLeft]
You're doing well, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you say so, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You still have doubts on[N]
your mind. Lay yourself bare.[A][N]
I truly do wish to clear up[N]
anything clouding you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] I don't deserve any of this.[A][N]
I still feel like nothing more than[N]
an outsider.[A][CloseEyes] Why[...] What have I[N]
done to earn any of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You are a brilliant young man.[A][N]
There is no need for you to doubt[N]
your intellect or your station.[A][N]
[...]I've been meaning to give you something[N]
for some time now.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]A sword?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More a symbollic prop than anything.[A][N]
You surely know of Arbordia's relic,[N]
the Foundation.[A] Well, that's only[N]
half of the story.[A] It's a truth[N]
lost to time,[A] but the Foundation was[N]
created by the founding lord of Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you mean, lost to time?[N]
The founding lord was Ar-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aercolyn. [...]That's where the truth[N]
has since been muddled.[A][N]
The founding Arbordia was a dear[N]
friend of the founding Aercolyn.[A][N]
As a show of goodwill, Aercolyn[N]
crafted a sword beyond wonder.[A][N]
[...]This blade. The Creator.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] exquisite.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Some generations back, the Foundation[N]
was stolen, the Creator was hidden,[A][N]
and the story of Dalst was entirely[N]
rewritten.[A] Part of me had considered[N]
eventually bringing that truth to light.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But then[...][N]
Sinclair von Aercolyn[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]His legacy deserves[N]
nothing now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Still[...] Did he not[N]
have a daughter?[A][N]
Does she not deserve to[N]
one day learn this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose that depends.[A][N]
Will she repent for her father's[N]
ruinous legacy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[...] Is it her place to?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. Perhaps not.[A][N]
[...]Why does this interest you so?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Pity, I suppose. She may very well[N]
forever be outcast from Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you are hardly outcast, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me. Just[...] give it time.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Your place is with us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This blade[...] The Creator. I entrust[N]
it to you as proof of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] Are you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is a blade nobody has seen[N]
for many decades.[A] It will[N]
hardly make much fuss.[A][N]
Keep it at your side and know that[N]
you deserve to be where you are.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Thank you, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Elcorian.[N]
Now, then. Let us be off.[A][N]
You still have infinite[N]
potential within you.[A][X]
