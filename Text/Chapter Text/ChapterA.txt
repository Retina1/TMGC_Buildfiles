##ZekeArcPrimer
Welcome to the Zeke Chapters![A][N]
This short stretch of the game[N]
will focus on a smaller party.[A][N]
Don't worry: you'll unite with[N]
Blair and company soon enough.[A][N]
A few notes for Zeke's maps:[A][N]
-The convoy has been disabled.[A][N]
You'll be forced to discard items[N]
if you run out of inventory room.[A][N]
Make sure to use what you have![A][N]
Additionally, there are no shops[N]
and no chances to sell any items.[A][N]
Because of this, while your displayed[N]
gold total IS based on what Blair has,[A][N]
that won't end up mattering.[A][N]
-Until you've reunited with Blair,[N]
any unit death will be a game over.[A][N]
-For escape maps, Zeke doesn't have[N]
to be the last unit to escape.[A][N]
-Starting now, talk conversations on[N]
maps will regularly give supports.[A][N]
This will carry over to Blair's maps.[A][N]
Good luck! I hope you've been[N]
enjoying the hack so far![A][X]

##Z1Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Well, then. I believe we're[N]
nearly there, Alexis.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent, Sir![N]
[...]Nearly where, exactly?[A][N]
You've told me little of our task[...][N]
Not to offend, of course![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, you've got a point. I apologize[N]
for keeping you in the dark so long.[A][N]
Especially since you're so inexperienced.[N]
But that's part of why I chose you.[A][N]
Despite your youth, you valiantly[N]
stood for the kingdom that day.[A][N]
I knew I needed one of your spirit[N]
for the road ahead.[A][N]
As for the task itself[...][A][N]
Do you recall Prince Zeke at all?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I think I would've been[...][N]
four or five when he passed?[A][N]
I knew of him, but never personally,[N]
of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well[...] Ever since his departure[...][N]
There's been[...] stirrings, I'll say.[A][N]
Do you recall the king's late[N]
advisor, Count Marius?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, absolutely![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Around the time of the Mevionese[N]
Revolution,[A] the man began to fear[N]
for the kingdom.[A] Far more than the[N]
king himself feared, really.[A][N]
After his passing, I found records[N]
of his indicating dealings.[A][N]
Specifically, notable sums of gold made out[N]
to a small community in Holanis.[A][N]
They began around twelve years ago,[N]
and periodically continued until he died,[A][N]
with a substantially larger sum three weeks[N]
before illness claimed him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's all this mean, sir?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, that's what we're here to discover.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But[...] I've got a theory.[N]
One that may shake the nation.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]We're here.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2][OpenLeft]
Pardon me, miss. I am Hyperius Galahads,[N]
envoy of Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
D-did you say[...] Elba Cor?[N]
Has[...] has the time come already?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Might I[...] ask why you're here?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Certainly. I am here[...] to settle loose ends.[A][N]
I've records of payments to this town,[N]
made by my colleague, the late Marius.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Y-you knew Marius? The reason[N]
this town's done well as it has?[A][N][OpenLeft]
You could say that. We both serve the crown.[N]
Might I ask the nature of these payments?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well[...] Marius had us swear to secrecy,[N]
but if he's gone, and if you knew him[...][A][N]
What harm can it do now?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Twelve years ago, a lone man[N]
arrived, bearing a young boy.[A][N]
He entrusted us with him and his identity,[N]
as well as a generous supply of gold.[A][N]
We were to protect him [OpenQuote]until such time came[N]
that he could come of age.[CloseQuote][A][N]
I believe he'd be[...] seventeen now?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Might I[...] Might I have that boy's name?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've come this far and heard me out[N]
for long enough.[A][N]
His name[...] is Ezekiel Johanes Courian.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
D-did you[...] say[...]?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Take us to him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
O-of course![A][X]

##Z1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon me. Who would you be?[N]
I don't[...] think[...][A][N]
Wait[...] You seem familiar[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that hair[...] It's unmistakable.[N]
[...]Prince Zeke. I have finally[...] found you.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I apologize for everything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What are you[...] Why are[N]
you apologizing, sir?[A][N]
[...]And who are you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
O-of course[...] Forgive me.[N]
I am Hyperius, your highness.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So[...] You know, then.[N]
That would explain it[...][A][N]
You're[...] so familiar[...][N]
Yet so foggy in my mind[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do not trouble yourself for now.[N]
It is[...] truly wonderful to see you alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why have you come, anyway?[N]
Father hasn't sent for my return.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that not what happened?[A][N]
Revolution broke out in Mevion,[N]
so Father faked my own death,[A][N]
and sent me out to Holanis to ensure[N]
my safety until I was grown?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that the story they told you?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I see. Zeke. Nobody alive outside of[N]
Holanis knows you live.[A][N]
Your father had no hand in this,[N]
and mourns you every day.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Why would Marius[...]? Hm[...][N]
Did he think you'd leave?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Father[...] thinks I'm dead? Who[...][N]
Who have I been writing to all this time?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]It matters not. I know what I must[N]
now do.[A] I must return home and set[N]
everything to rights.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Brilliantly said, your highness.[N]
That was my plan all along.[A][N]
Well, then. No time to lose.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadAlexis]
Sir Hyperius! [...]Your highness![A][N]
It's an honor![N]
Anyway[...] Uh[...] Hyperius![A][N]
Sir! We've got trouble![A][X]

##Z1Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenLeft]
Bandits! All around us![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What in the[...] Where did[N]
they come from?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This place has had bandits, but[N]
not anything of this scale[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Well, your highness? Your orders?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you mean, orders?[A][N][OpenLeft]
We serve you now, prince.[N]
We'll protect you until we die![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Uh[...] Alright[...][N]
Orders[...] orders[...][A][N]
If we make a break for the west[...][N]
We should be able to outrun them.[A][N]
This town has capable warriors.[N]
They'll survive without us.[A][N]
And I[...] I can't stay.[N]
Knowing what I know.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Very well. We're behind you, your highness.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you. Give me one moment[N]
to grab something[...][A][X]

##Z1Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
It's nothing special[...] But this lance[...][N]
It just feels right in my hands.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[...] You've taken up lances.[N]
Personally, I've never mastered them.[A][N]
Bows, axes, and especially swords[N]
have always been my forte.[A][N]
Alexis here prefers axes herself.[N]
She's skilled at pressing advantages.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Back up. Did you mention bows?[N]
I know some archery as well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're an archer, too?[N]
You're just like your father.[A][N]
It's not much, but I've got a bow,[N]
and some extra medicine.[A][N]
Take it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Hyperius.[N]
[...]It's time to begin.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove](I didn't think this day would come so soon.[N]
Or that what I knew would all be so wrong.)[A][N]
(But all I can do now is fight. Fight,[N]
so I finally see Father once again.)[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Z1LeilaText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeila]
[...]Are you exhausted, girl?[N]
[...]Fine. We'll pause a mome-[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Pardon me. Who goes there?[N]
This place is unsafe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
(Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.[N]
Damn it. Anyone but him.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]
Wait[...] A pegasus?[N]
Are you perchance from Elba Cor?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
(Dammitdammitdammitdammitdammit.[N]
What do I say what do I say?)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]
Hm[...] Your hair seems[...][N]
Wait a moment.[A][N]
I recognize you. You're Leila.[N]
One of the deserters.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
([...]God damn it.)[A][N][ToggleMouthMove]
Alright, you got me.[N]
What do you need?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What are you doing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're of the Elba Cor pegasus knights.[N]
It's your duty to serve the crown.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I left that life.[A][N]
Look, if we're going to have[N]
a problem[...][A][X]

##Z1LeilaText2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeila][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You can take it up with my blade.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you really think you can[N]
strike me down?[A][N]
Your former commander?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No.[N]
Goodbye.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Have you no pride left?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Never had any to start with.[N]
Look, I loved catching up. Truly.[A][N]
But I've gotta get going.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What's that look for?[N]
Your contempt means nothing, old man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]God damn it.[N]
Fine. Just[...] I'm not staying.[A][N]
For long, that is. I'm just[N]
doing this to shut you up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Good to have you back in the ranks.[A][X]

##Z1Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenLeft][LoadZeke][OpenRight][LoadHyperius][OpenFarRight][LoadLeila][OpenRight]
That's behind us. But we must[N]
keep moving.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You know the way better than I.[A][N][OpenRight]
Alexis, I'll forge ahead. Stay close[N]
to the prince in case anything happens.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It'd be an honor, sir![A][N][OpenRight]
Leila, scout ahead. Tell me[N]
if you see any more bandits.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Whatever you say.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You're so good at this, Hyperius.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's a skill you must learn, prince.[A][N]
Sizing up your allies, and understanding[N]
how best to utilize their strengths.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I've read up on tactics before, but[N]
to put them into practice[...][A][N]
It's something completely different.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, you know what they say.[N]
Experience is the best teacher.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Well said, sir![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Don't expect me to echo your praise.[N]
[...]I'll be off ahead. Try not to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
Who is she, anyway?[A][N][OpenRight]
Her name is Leila. She was a prodigous[N]
knight under my command.[A][N]
Three years ago, she deserted.[N]
Nobody ever figured out why.[A][N]
It's quite a miraculous coincidence[N]
to find her here.[A][N]
And it's even more miraculous that[N]
she hasn't left again. Yet.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I see[...] Despite everything[...][N]
I feel we can trust her.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us hope so.[N]
We should be off.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. I'm behind you all the way.[A][X]

##Z1HouseText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadDean]
So, the prince is leavin', I see.[N]
Well, it's been a good ride.[A][N]
Guess without the old count payin'[N]
us to shelter 'im,[A] things may[N]
get rough here, money-wise.[A][N]
But, don't worry. We'll make do.[A][N]
There's some mercs I've been[N]
talkin' to.[A] Known them a long[N]
time, in fact.[A] Might start to[N]
take a few more jobs with 'em.[A][N]
Maybe I'll see ya' around.[A][N]
If not, at least take this old thing.[N]
You'll get more outta it than me.[A][X]

##Z1RoarkBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoark]
You're a bold one.[N]
Real bold.[A][N]
But nobody's ever beaten me.[N]
Think on that while you die.[A][X]

##Z1RoarkZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoark]
You want to get in my way?[A][N]
Scram, brat. Before I[N]
chop you up.[A][N]
[...]Well then. Looks like[N]
you're gonna die, bud.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Sorry, but I can't die.[N]
I've too much to do.[A][X]

##Z1RoarkDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoark]
Too strong[...][N]
Who in the hell[...] are you[...]?[A][X]
