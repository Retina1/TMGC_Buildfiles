Did you need me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, but[...] Are you[...] alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What[...] makes you[N]
ask that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've seemed somewhat out[N]

It was all[...] familiar.[A][N]
I[...] I don't know why.[N]

Everything[...] makes sense.[A][N]
What[...] if I was a subject?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]What if you were?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
