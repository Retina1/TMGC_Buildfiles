can freeload with boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Perhaps don't phrase it[N]
like that.[A][N]

I[...] think I am.[A][N]
I'll be alright with you two.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It gladdens me that you think[N]
you're safe by my side.[A][N]
[...]At the same time, it is a burden[N]
I hesitate to trust myself with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Now's not the time to[N]

You've done excellently[N]

That I am. Today, I shall reach[N]
for the heavens,[A] and channel[N]
their wrath.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Does that actually mean anything?[N]
Just say you'll fight real good.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]How naive. Just because we're in[N]
a hellish conflict[...][A][N]
That means not that I can neglect[N]
honing my linguistic flair.[A][N]
If the oral tradition dies, so[N]
too does what makes us human.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]What?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just[...] let 'er do it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Shall we proceed to the battlefield,[N]
instead of critiquing my tongue?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yes. [...]Never phrase it[N]

Fry, you say. You're a scary kid.[A][N]
A funny kid, no doubt. But a[N]
very scary kid.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Don't patronize me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Wouldn't dream of it.[N]
You're impressive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Make sure to keep 'er safe, Rift.[N]
Couldn't stand if she fell now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I know[...] all too well the fate[N]
of the others.[A] And none[N]

I'm[...] sorry, kid. I know there's[N]
nothin' I could've done.[A][N]

See who bags more foes?[A][N][OpenRight]
That's every battle for me.[N]
Competition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just remember what we're[N]
'ere for. Duty. Not glory.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
There's a glory in duty.[A][N]
But I see your meaning.[N]
I'll restrain myself.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Like hell I will.[N]
I live for glory.[A][N]
Not to say I won't help[N]

hell is the point of my life?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hadn't you fought alongside us[N]
to find a new point?[A][N]
Seems like not much has changed.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Hey. Protecting people's far more[N]
purposeful than arena stuff.[A][N]
Saving lives instead of turning[N]
them into a cheap thrill.[A][N]
[...]Even if I[...] couldn't[N]
save anyone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Don't blame yerself, lad.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Wilhelm wouldn't stand[N]

We'll see?[A][N]
We've been through hell[N]

Now's the time to be[N]
decisive.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]If I were truly decisive,[N]
I'd decisively doubt our odds.[A][N]
Not to downplay us, but[...][N]
Things're bad.[A] To put it[N]
very lightly.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Have at least some faith.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get the apprehension, lad.[N]
But that'll just ensure our end.[A][N]
Strike wit' at least a bit o'[N]
confidence.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Yup.[A] [...]Not like I'm not[N]
used to deathmarches.[A][N][OpenRight]
Good thing this won't be one.[A][N]

[...]No you're not. Not gonna let[N]
you just die like that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]So you're not. Well, then.[A][N]
Guess I'll just have to keep[N]
up with you.[A] Can't slow you[N]
down when you're like this.[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't say this to many people,[N]
but you're damned strong.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll have no issue[N]
staying alive.[A] As long as[N]
you will it, that is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The lad's right. Don't ever[N]
stop fightin', Argent.[A][N]
We'd be nowhere fast without[N]
your skill and mind.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Of course. As long as I[N]

I don't need that. The strength[N]
I've got now is fine.[A][N]
My own power'll never betray me.[A][N]

Indeed. All we can do is[N]
believe in our instincts.[A][N]
Not what I'm normally apt[N]

This has been a[...] new[N]
experience, in many ways.[A][N]
Some good. Many bad.[N]
What's one more change?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You adapt well, bud.[A][N]

We've all broken a bit.[A][N][OpenRight]
Exactly.[A] And today, we[N]

Doubt it'll be anythin' that[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Does it count if I'm ready[N]
for this to all be long over?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Show some manner of tact, friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's alright. We're all wishin'[N]
for this to end.[A][N]
Alas. Until we've made good o'[N]
the others, it'll never be over.[A][N][OpenRight]
Glad we're on the same page.[N]
Don't get me wrong, though.[A][N]
My wanting for this to be over[N]
won't hold me back.[A][N]
I'll fight good as I ever have.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As shall I. I will see my[N]
duty to Viridian through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to hear, lads. [...]You ready[N]
to throw yourselves at them?[A][N][OpenRight]
Throw's a strong verb.[A][N]
But I'll see if I can't[N]
come out ahead.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanManfredArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Only one way to truly find out.[N]
[...]Metaphorical trial by fire.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Alas.[A][N]
Being brought to the brink is the one[N]
true way to know if you'll survive it.[A][N]
[...]If you can't, you're already dead.[A][N][OpenRight]
A harsh reality I'm sure you've[N]
seen many a time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You've come this far.[N]
That's not nothing.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll live.[A][N]
We'll all live.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]We have to live.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Indeed. We'll live up to[N]
what the others lived for.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Shall we, boss?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We shall, Manfred.[A] [...]Advance![A][N]
Show the enemy what we stand for![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanWilhelmArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
I[...] have long been.[A][N]
To fight and to fall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If you could keep your falling[N]
to a minimum for this battle,[A][N]
that'd be real great.[A][N]
Not that I don't trust the[N]
boss and I to prevail.[A][N]
[...]But I'd rather not take[N]
that chance.[A][N]
Especially with[...] recent events.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will see you both through[N]
this day safely.[A][N]
[...]We'll all live on for them.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us hope you speak true.[A][N]
There is much for me to[N]
atone for still.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm less an atoner and more[N]
a generalist liver.[A][N]
But I've got a lot to do still.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then let's go. We'll make[N]
it through this.[A][N]
We'll all see another day.[A][X]

Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm ready to find out, friend.[A][N]
[...]Funny how this job you've[N]
dragged me into has gone.[A][N]
I have borne witness to joy[N]
and sorrow alike.[A][N]
I have changed. It has been[N]
a truly unforgettable journey.[A][N]
[...]Though many friends are[N]
now gone,[A] I am glad[N]
this has happened.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]It's been[...] sad. But[...][N]
I'm happy I met you two.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's enough of a reason[N]
to live, I guess.[A][N]
[...]Plus, now I kinda have to[N]
uphold the others' legacy.[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly. Once we're done here,[A][N]
we shall etch the name of[N]
Viridian into history.[A][N]
All shall go unforgotten.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[...] like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As do I. But first, we must[N]
carve ourselves a path.[A][N]
Let's go, you two![A][X]

I'll blow them away![A][N][OpenRight]
I'll[...] not. [...]But I'm sure[N]
I can be helpful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're invaluable, kid.[N]
Healing's a godsend.[A][N]
And we'll see about blowing[N]
them all away.[A] You'll have[N]
to keep up with my skill.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Is that a challenge, boss?[N]
[...]I'm not backing down![A][N]
I'll fry twice as many[N]
as you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good. Let that flame carry you[N]
through![A] This[...] will be one[N]
hell of a battle.[A][N]
But we'll succeed.[N]
I just know it, kid.[A][X]

I'm all the muscle we'll ever[N]
need, right here.[A][N]
Watch me go, sister.[N]
I'll take 'em all out.[A][N][OpenRight]
Just be careful, brother.[N]
Wouldn't want to lose you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I'll be fine. Trust me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to see you're eager.[A][N]
Now, then. Let's put that energy[N]
to work.[A] We've one hell of a[N]
fight coming up.[A][N]
But[...] It'll all be worth it.[A][N]
I can feel it.[A][N][OpenRight]
We're behind you, mister.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I trust you with my life.[N]
[...]Not hers.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Let's see if my[N]
performance today can change that.[A][N]

Why act as if it'll be a surprise?[A][N]
I'm made of all it takes to[N]
shred through our foes.[A][N][OpenRight]
I[...] know you're strong.[N]
But[...] everyone else was[...][A][N]
And[...] they all[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Not to disrespect them.[N]
But I'll surpass them.[A][N]
It's disheartening that the[N]
others all died.[A][N]
But I[...] won't make their[N]
mistakes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I wouldn't call their actions[N]
mistakes.[A] But I appreciate[N]
your sentiment.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Whatever you call it, I'll live.[N]
I'm[...] too strong to die.[A][N]
And if I'm livin', I'll make[N]
sure you two are too.[A][N]
You've done me well.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't act like I can't keep[N]
us afloat, either.[A][N]

I'm sure of it.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we have a choice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose we could've always[N]
turned our back on everything.[A][N]
[...]But that wouldn't be a satisfying[N]
ending for any of us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Absolutely not![A][N]
We[...] have to help them.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Not strictly speaking. But[...][N]
We're in too deep, anyway.[A][N]
[...]For the record, I was never[N]
planning on running.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I doubted you were. I never once[N]
considered that choice either.[A][N]
We've a legacy to live up to.[N]
Something demanding conviction.[A][N]
Something that I hope to do proud.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]We'll make them all proud.[N]
I'm sure of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to hear it, kid.[A][N]
[...]Time to go.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yup. I've seen them too.[A][N][OpenRight]
So[...] have I.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. Real small world.[A][N]
[...]Almost enough to make me[N]
think hard about things.[A][N]
But not today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Today's hardly a thinking day.[N]
It's a day of reckoning.[A][N]
Dishing out vengeance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Cheers to that, Rift.[A][N]
What about you, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't think vengeance[N]
is quite my thing[...][A][N]
But I'll gladly keep you[N]
two alive and fighting for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'll do. [...]Well.[N]

Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm[...] not made of much.[N]
But I'll still try to help.[A][N][OpenRight]
Remember, young one. No man can[N]
do everything on their own.[A][N]
Through understanding each of our[N]
strengths and weaknesses,[A][N]
we can become more than the[N]
sum of our parts.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Nah. I'm confident I could[N]
take dozens of these fools.[A][N]
[...]Guess a bit of support wouldn't[N]
hurt, though.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Support? I can[...] do that.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Don't go dying, please.[N]
We need you alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Only because you refuse[N]
to take command.[A][N]
But, fine. I don't plan on it.[N]
Just you watch me.[A][X]

The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've always been ready to[N]
carve a path of destruction![A][N][OpenRight]
[...]That's[...] a bit dramatic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's the truth, though.[A][N]
Destruction's[...] always followed me.[N]
I like the idea of controlling it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Harnessing the forces that uproot[N]
your life[...][A] Truly a lofty[N]
idea, Rose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What? That's not what[N]
I said, though.[A][N]
You don't need to make things[N]
more complicated than they are.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I disagree, but I also digress.[A][N]
For now, we just need destruction.[N]
And we'll rain it down.[A][X]

Ready as I'll ever be.[N]
[...]You, sister?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same here, brother.[A][N]
I don't think we'll ever[N]
be truly ready[...][A][N]
But together, we'll be[N]
ready enough.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Simply excellent.[A][N]
Well, then. If the both of[N]
you feel prepared,[A][N]
there's no point in holding[N]
off any longer.[A][N]

I'm up for anything, boss.[A][N]
That's my specialty, really.[N]
Taking on any role.[A][N]
Especially after[...] recent events.[N]
Nothing will ever slow me down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] can't do much alone.[N]
But I can assist you two.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fine by me. Just try to[N]
keep up with me.[A][N]
[...]Don't worry. I'll slow[N]
down if I must.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
An uncommon courtesy of[N]
you, truly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thank you.[A][N][OpenRight]

We dazzle, my friend.[A][N]
We're the showstoppers.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Showstoppers?[A][N][OpenRight]
We've shown that we're truly capable[N]
of anything lately.[A] We channel that[N]
into our fighting today.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That sounds like a drawn-out[N]
way of saying [OpenQuote]we've got this.[CloseQuote][A][N]
But, hey. Hope's a strong thing.[N]
I'll take it if you have it.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's not just hope. It's certainty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're sure we'll make it?[N]
[...]That makes me feel[...] better.[A][N]

What's good enough for the kid[N]
is good enough for me.[A][N]

'Twill be an endless day.[N]

I'm[...] ready to help.[N]
I'll[...] be okay.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. You two are better[N]
prepared for this than I.[A][N]
Impressive.[A][N][OpenRight]
No need to undersell yourself. Your skill[N]
is far beyond your understanding.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're well beyond flattery.[N]
[...]But thanks.[A][N]

I sure hope so. These bones[N]
better still be worth something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They[...] are. You've done so[N]
much for us, miss.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hardly. And call me Argent.[N]
I don't deserve your titles.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No, really. You have done[N]
a spectacular job, Argent.[A][N]
As have you, Eliza.[A][N]
You are both laudable examples.[N]
Ones which I aspire to.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[...] you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenFarRight]
Kindness is much a rarity.[N]
Especially now.[A][N]
[...]Alas, kindness will not win[N]

Made it this far.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

you two are pretty alright.[A][N]
Won't let anyone stab you[N]
without passing by me.[A][N]
And I'll fry anyone who[N]
passes me by.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate it, Rose.[A][N]
You're a friend to both Eliza[N]

I'll raise it for you.[N]
Big fires and all that.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I can raise enough hell[N]
for the three of us.[A][N]
But I[...] That was a figure[N]
of speech, anyway.[A][N]
We'll do our time, do our[N]

Maybe slay some goons.[A][N]
Doesn't need to be any[N]

collateral damage.[A][N]
We can always fix that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

I've got up my sleeve.[A][N]
Excellently deadly tricks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What now?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Nothing you need know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Will[...] I really be helpful?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. You've been an asset[N]

Carefully.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Very funny. We're beyond[N]

We'll tear through everything[N]
that stands in our way.[A][N]
That's all I've ever known, and that[N]
is all we'll know from now on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I hesitate to agree, but[N]
I also can't disagree.[A][N]
We're well into a life we cannot[N]
turn our backs from.[A][N]
But I'll lead us through it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I shall proudly follow.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Didn't mean to start a[N]

[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Are you ready, gentlemen?[A][N]
Any lingering regrets?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yeah. But they're small[N]
potatoes compared to[...][A][N]
Well, everything that has[N]
happened.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]The debtors coming for my[N]
kneecaps seem so distant.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I'll take that as a no.[N]
I've long had many.[A][N]
But regrets of the one are[N]
nothing,[A] compared to those[N]
of the many who've fallen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Look. Don't go souring[N]
the mood, please.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Bit late for that. But a sour[N]
mood has never dulled my blade.[A][N]
I'll[...] shred them all.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Good to hear. Argent.[N]
You and I make for the lady.[A][N]

Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ma'am, yes, ma'am![A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Sure.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We're quite the[...] unusual bunch,[N]
I must admit.[A][N]
But that makes us the underdogs.[N]
The ones with nothing to lose.[A][N]
The ones who'll win the day,[N]
because that it how it goes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you saying we'll win because[N]
we're the underdogs?[A][N]
Not true. We'll win because[N]
you have me![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Rose. You are not an enduring[N]
trope of the dramatic tradition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Today'll solidify me as one.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Can[...] we go?[A][N][OpenFarRight]

'Tis hardly a joyful occasion,[N]
but[...][A] I suppose we[N]
can get joy some from it.[A][N][OpenRight]
What's not to love about revenge?[A][N]
Tearing those who've wronged you[N]
limb from limb.[A] [...]Catharsis.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Fair enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can't really tear. So I guess[N]
I'll just fry 'em all.[A][N][OpenRight]

[...]You have a plan?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
But of course! It's one so[N]

[...]It is?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course! Follow my lead![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd rather not bank it all[N]
on something from you.[A][N]
Not without explanation, at least.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Fine. We'll follow your plan.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Rats. I was excited.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look[...] Just[...] Stay behind me,[N]
the two of you.[A][N]
That's the least I can[N]
do for us now.[A][N]
It's[...] penance, in a sense.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

We've got some revenge to serve![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]The kid likes revenge that much?[N]
You're scary.[A][N][OpenRight]
I mustn't lie, it sounds pretty[N]
nice right around now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Not saying it doesn't.[A][N]
Just sits weird with the kid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Okay. And?[A][N][OpenFarRight]

Ready as these bones'll ever be.[N]
What about you, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm[...] ready. We'll crush[N]
those bastards.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Spoken like a true heroine[N]
in the making, Rose![A][N]
When we make it through to[N]
the day's end,[A] we'll be[N]
immortalized in history![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]History can forget me.[N]
But I appreciate the enthusiasm.[A][N][OpenRight]

focus on me either.[A][N]
No reason for that. Of course.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

Sounds quite remarkable.[A][N][OpenRight]

sound like a sight to behold.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]What beauty is there here?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hey, she started it. And if[N]
she sees it,[A] and if it keeps[N]
her going, I won't judge.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's just who I am. I create[N]
from sorrow.[A] Make something[N]
beautiful of it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenRight]

Succinct, I see. Well, I suppose[N]
more detail would be redundant.[A][N]
We shall indeed give them hell.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Glad we've settled that.[A][N]
Hell is no less than what they[N]
all deserve.[A][N]
Vengeance'll[...] be nice.[A][N]
And then we'll do our duty[N]
to those who're fallen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

Patience. What's our plan, boss?[A][N]
We must make the most of this chance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[...] hadn't much of a plan.[N]
Just was gonna wing it.[A][N]
Unless you've got anything better.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Ah. Well, then.[N]
Improvisation.[A][N]
I'm fine with that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll[...] do my thing.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

one for fighting, Estelle.[A][N]
I'm impressed how well you've[N]
risen to this role.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It is the least I could do.[N]
I've performed many a role.[A][N]
I just see this as one more[N]
in my great lineage.[A][N]
The three of us are but[N]
wandering specks of dust.[A][N]
Only by standing as one[N]

and only through leadership[N]

We dazzle them, my friend.[A][N][OpenRight]

Use our skills to take down[N]
the baddies.[A] While impressing[N]
the noblewoman.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I see. I think I'll just[N]
fight like normal.[A][N]
No showboating.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As shall I. But, Estelle.[N]

The catharsis of a blade.[A][N][OpenRight]
A daring clash in the darkest[N]
of moonless nights[...][A][N]
A scene truly beyond compare.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to wax poetic. It's what[N]
it is. Mercenary work.[A][N]
Kill or be killed.[A][N]
We're[...] still alive, and if we're[N]
not careful, that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yeah. That's obvious.[A][N]
Look, no need to be[N]
a downer, Wilhelm.[A][N]
We've enough of that.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us have some manner[N]
of joy with this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Apologies. I suppose[N]
it is something.[A][N]

Destiny, revenge[...][A][N]

It'll be an honor for many[N]
more years, friend.[A][X]

[...]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
Why do you ask us? You are[N]
the one in command here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Look. Back me up here.[A][N][OpenRight]
Apologies. I believe we[N]
ought to converge with her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Rose?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Me? That's[...] a good idea.[N]
[...]I think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
'Twas my plan too. [...]So we're[N]
all in agreement.[A][N]
I'm glad to hear.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, then. I'll keep the two[N]
of you safe.[A] You'll live to[N]
return to Opistia.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...]No.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd rather not. But I[N]
appreciate the sentiment.[A][N]
[...]Let's just get on with this.[A][X]

##Ch24_RoseWilhelmArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Your orders, young man?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to get so hasty.[N]
Obviously, we charge.[A][N]
[...]Are you ready, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I[...] don't know.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yeah. Me neither.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Could you be slightly more[N]
encouraging, perhaps?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You seem to have that handled[N]
pretty well.[A] If you're making[N]
me lead, you can do morale.[A][N]
And the kid can be our mascot.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Mascot?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Something like that, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Please take this[N]
seriously.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Who's saying I'm not?[N]
[...]Well, anyway.[A][N]
Time to charge, you two.[N]
Stay alive. It'd be nice.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Alright, mister.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Because you asked kindly.[A][X]

[...]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We raise hell. Thoughts[N]
on my plan?[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...]It's[...] what they deserve.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Some old-fashioned wrath of[N]
the righteous?[A] Fair enough.[N]
Well, then. No need to dawdle.[A][N]
We've all people we'd like to[N]
avenge.[A] And joining them is[N]
how we'll achieve our vengeance.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Let's go, then.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm behind you two all the way.[N]
[...]Well, charging ahead.[A][N]
You know what I mean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That I do, friend.[N]
Now then. Charge![A][X]

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. On with it.[N]
We're raring to go.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Yeah.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Welp. No holding the two of[N]
you back.[A] Hell, not sure why[N]
I'm holding myself back.[A][N]
We're just three vengeful men[N]
with nothing left to lose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Wouldn't say nothing.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Let's just[...] get on with it.[N]
Good luck, gentlemen.[N]
[...]We're gonna need it.[A][X]

##Ch24_DirkCallumArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDirk][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're quite adept at that.[N]
[...]It's a fine skill.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Thanks. I think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenRight]
Ah. Right. On with this.[N]
Apologies.[A][N]
If I were one of you, I'd[N]
hate me for wasting time too.[A][N]
[...]Not sure why I'm the[N]
one leading here.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It is not my place. And Dirk's[...][N]
He's hurting.[A][N]
You're our most capable.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]That feels[...] good.[N]
Hearing that.[A][N]
[...]Thanks.[A][N]
[...]Well, no more dawdling.[N]
Hit them where it hurts![A][N]
And then hit them again![N]
And again![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I can do that.[A][X]

[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[...][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Let's go.[A][N][OpenRight]
You heard the kid. No comedy[N]
routine for us today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]All the same, then.[A][N]
There's no cutting this tension[N]
anyway.[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps later we can revel.[A][N]
But for now, we must do what[N]
we swore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Let's[...] get this done.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Yup. Onwards, gentlemen.[N]
Don't show them any mercy![A][X]

[...]I believe we're finally[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]How else? We seek[N]
vengeance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Succinct. I agree. But it's[N]
up to you, Manfred.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Vengeance[...] That sounds good[N]
right about now.[A][N]
We've been through hell.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
Indeed we have.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And now, it's time we turn[N]
the tables.[A] Show them our[N]
own brand of hell.[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Let's move, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. On my mark.[N]
We stand as one.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I'll stand with you[N]
until my bitter end.[A][X]

[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]On with it, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I agree. Time's wasting as long[N]
as we're standing here.[A][N]
I've learned something from[N]
my many long years:[A][N]
You've gotta act.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That[...] was my plan. Deliberation's[N]
never been me, either.[A][N]
Lived a life at the whim of[N]
the cards and the kingdom.[A][N]
Leading[...] Deciding[...][N]
That's all new.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're doing as well as[N]
we could hope.[A][N]
Better than either of us.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
I've seen that look many times.[N]
Despondence. Indignation.[A][N]
Well, friend. Today, you'll[N]
get what you want.[A][N]
One way or another.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We all shall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ayup. Anyway, it's time.[N]
On my mark.[A][X]

[...]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[...][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly, friend. What a cruel[N]
mistress time is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This is it, isn't it?[A][N]
Our last chance to make things right.[N]
To make good of the fallen.[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we seek vengeance.[N]
What is there to avenge?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Now's not the time to question why[N]
we fight.[A] It's funny, really.[A][N]
Normally, I'd be all over finding[N]
some way to justify myself.[A][N]
But now[...] I think I understand.[A][N]
What it means to be a part of[N]
something bigger.[A][N]
[...]Or maybe the ash has finally[N]
gotten to my brain.[A][N][OpenRight]
As always, you baffle us.[N]
But I see your meaning.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't, but I guess we're in[N]
too deep now, anyway.[A][N]
Well. It's been fun.[N]
Time to raise some hell.[A][X]

[...]I believe we're finally[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's simple. We proceed in[N]
our assigned duty.[A][N]
To not would be to disgrace[N]
all the others fell for.[A][N][OpenRight]
Grace isn't my strong suit.[A][N]
But they're against the ones[N]
that took out the others.[A][N]
So it's an easy choice for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I figured as much.[A][N]
As acting leader, I just wanted[N]
to ensure we were of the same mind.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Thanks.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're doing good. Now, then.[N]
What're our orders?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. March out, and[N]
stay wary, friends.[A][N]
Don't stop fighting until[N]
the bitter end![A][N][OpenFarRight]
It would be an honor.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]

Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
You know who's gonna end up[N]
ravaged real soon?[A] Everyone[N]
who's standin' in our way.[A][N]
I've had enough of the world[N]
punching me around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd[...] agree. Even if this is[N]
what I deserve[...][A][N]
I'm going to fight.[A][N]
It's what I've done all these[N]
long years,[A] and, damn it.[A][N]
I won't stop until I'm dead.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Keep that energy up, you two.[N]
We've got a long road ahead.[A][N]
Now, then.[A][CloseEyes] (This one's for[N]
you, old friend.)[A][N][OpenEyes]
Move out![A][X]

[...]Glad to see you two still[N]
got that routine going.[A][N]
[...]Any last regrets?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Far too many to count.[N]
But surely not as many as you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I suppose so. I fight to ease[N]
my regrets.[A] [...]But that just[N]
creates new ones.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]It's time. Wilhelm.[N]
It's been an honor.[A][N]
You too, Argent.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We're not dying today.[N]
No need to speak like that.[A][N]

[...]Indeed. We fight[N]
for the fallen.[A][X]
