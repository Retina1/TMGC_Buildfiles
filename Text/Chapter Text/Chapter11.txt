[...]What's this? A road?[A][N][MoveMidRight]
[...]Rubble?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Rustle!* [...]Huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[...]Who's there?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAgnes]
[...]Ah. Just one o' you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're[...] one of Cid's, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Agnes. I was gonna[...][N]
run off.[A] Nothin' left[N]
for me, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What're you looking at[N]
me for, pal?[A][N]
[...]Damn it. Fine. Cap[...][N]
would've wanted me to help you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, yeah. I know the lady's[...][N]
beatin' herself up.[A][N]
Suppose it'd be terrible of me[N]
to just leave you all.[A][N]
You'd better thank me![A][X]

##Ch11_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
We've arrived in Opistia.[N]
All I can see is sand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Blair. I understand how you're feeling,[N]
but for the rest of our sakes,[A][N]
we need your leadership.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]O-Of course.[N]
A-Apologies.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Anyway. I believe our target is[N]
the capital city, Opistinia.[A][N]
[...]Is everything here actually[N]
named after Opistus?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]You'd be correct. The capital's[N]
where the archbishop resides.[A][N]
We've just got to[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think I heard something.[N]
Off in the distance.[A][X]

##Ch11_Opening2Part1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia][OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel]
[...]No luck. That's unfortunate.[N]
Well, keep at it.[A][N]
Your men are bound to strike[N]
artifacts someday.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas. I'm tired of being stuck[N]
this far north,[A] but what[N]
can be done?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. I must be off now.[A][N]
[...]Simone disappeared again.[N]
Hopefully she's not far.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
She's hardly worth the trouble.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps. But she's a genius.[N]
And she's been around[...][A][N]
17 years? 18? Details, really.[A][N]
[...]I'm sure she's just off on[N]
some strange errand.[A][N]
She'll probably return.[A][N]
Anyway, good day.[A][X]

##Ch11_Opening2Part2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
Well, then. At least I've[N]
time to get something don-[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie2]
We've got trouble, miss![N]
There's some unfamiliars at the shore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh? Intruders?[N]
[...]Damn it.[A][N]
This was supposed to be simple.[N]
Well, you know what to do.[A][N]
Kill them all.[A][X]

##Ch11_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
They're approaching.[N]
What's your plan?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What other plan do we have?[N]
We must once again fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. If we can make it into[N]
those ruins, we should be alright.[A][N]
Just mind that we ought to keep[N]
some units back at the boat.[A][N]
We can't afford to take everyone[N]
into every fight, anymore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understandable.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Let's get this done.[A][X]

##Ch11_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
That's that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Who were those people? They appeared[N]
to be[...] searching for something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm unsure, and it's likely not[N]
worth our concern.[A][N]
We must find the archbishop.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadVladmir]
Oho? Did someone call for me?[A][X]

##Ch11_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
What lovely happenstance![N]
Opistus told me of this day.[A][N]
Greetings, young women. I am Vladmir,[N]
archbishop to the Church of Opistus.[A][N]
A pleasure to meet you.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah! Hello! I'm Blair, of Aercolyn.[N]
This is Arin.[A] We're here on behalf[N]
of King Brandl of Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd imagine it's about Yg'stra's[N]
recent actions.[A] We're loathe to[N]
engage in warfare,[A] but if it's necessary[N]
to protect our people, we shall fight.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]In fact, on our way to Opistia,[N]
we happened upon some pilgrims.[A][N]
They were accosted by pirates,[N]
and we came to their aid.[A][N]
Unfortunately, they all met their[N]
end at the hands of the Yg'stran navy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[...] Opistian lives have already[N]
met their end to this conflict.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Judgement shall be fierce[N]
and absolute.[A] But enough of that.[N]
I shall escort you to our capital.[A][N][OpenRight]
Thank you, sir![A][X]

##Ch11_Ending3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden][OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus][OpenMidLeft]
Lazarus. Care to explain yourself?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What for, oh, Commander Valden?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You damned well know. You once again[N]
left your post and threw away men.[A][N]
All for what? A noble with little[N]
to no bearing on this war?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's where you're wrong. She's[N]
a target of vital importance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The only importance she serves is[N]
driving you to madness.[A][N]
You've long been a problem, Lazarus.[N]
But you've also long been capable.[A][N]
[...]However, you can hide behind your[N]
combat prowess no longer.[A][N]
Effective immediately, you are stripped of your[N]
post and to be dishonorably discharged.[A][N]
I will also require our sacred[N]
treasure be returned.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The Arkhinal[...]? You bastard![N]
Nobody else can use it like I can![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Too bad for you.[A][N]
I suppose we'll have to win this[N]
war on the strength of man.[A][N]
Now, begone from my sight.[N]
May you find purpose elsewhere.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That fool. He doesn't[N]
know what he's lost.[A][N]
Of course, I've that girl[N]
to blame for all this.[A][N]
But she's slipped my grasp[N]
for the last time.[A][N]
Our last encounters[...] were[N]
just the preamble.[A][N][CloseEyes]
All the misery I've forced[N]
her through[...][A][N]
It shall all come to a head.[N]
It'll be glorious.[A][N]
And then[...] I'll be seen for[N]
the champion I truly am.[A][X]

##Ch11_Hilbert_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Are you[...] a child?[N]
What are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Child? I'm already 14 years old![N]
That's old enough to save people![A][N]
It's never too early to spread[N]
word of Hilbert the Hero![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So, your name is Hilbert,[N]
I presume?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's right, miss![A][N]
I'm out here defending[N]
the people of Opistia![A][N]
You and your friends seem[N]
to be in need of help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate that, but you're[...][N]
Well, a mere child![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A-Are you[...] doubting me?[A][N]
[...]I'll just have to prove[N]
myself capable, then![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]And there he goes.[A][N]
I feel wrong about this,[N]
but who am I to stop him?[A][X]

##C11SofiaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
Our goals demand what[N]
relics lie in these sands.[A][N]
To that end, we must[N]
dispose of you.[A][X]

##C11SofiaSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
[...]Wait[...] What are you?[N]
You're[...] unnatural.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Don't tell me[...][N]
No matter.[A][N]
Whatever you are, you[N]
cannot be left alive.[A][X]

##C11SofiaKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
Another elder scholar?[N]
You should join us.[A][N]
You seek knowledge and power,[N]
things we have in spades.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
You think I'd join a shady[N]
bunch as yourselves?[A][N]
I'm sorry to disappoint.[N]
You can keep your power.[A][X]

##C11SofiaEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
[...]Who would you be?[N]
Your power[...] It's familiar.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
I can't say we've met.[N]
My name is Emile.[A][N]
If you aim to stand in[N]
our way,[A] I must[N]
strike you down.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
[...]You can try.[A][X]

##C11SofiaHilbertBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Beware, dastardly villain![N]
I am Hilbert, evil's bane![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
[...]Do I really have[N]
to kill a kid?[A][N]
For the love of[...][N]
Well, it's what it is.[A][X]

##C11SofiaDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
How[...] unfortunate[...][N]
Dying in[...] this land[...][A][X]
