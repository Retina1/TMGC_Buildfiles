Heya, boss lady. 'ow's things?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well. What about you, Agnes?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sore. Used to a boat bringin' me[N]
everywhere.[A] All walkin' contained[N]
within a small ship.[A][N]
Spent me 'ole life on boats,[N]
and now I'm a filthy landlubber.[A][N]
But, 'ey. That's why I gotta see[N]
this thin' through.[A][N]
One day, I'll be back on the[N]

a hard time sleeping now.[A][N]
You'd think I'd be all over this.[A][N]
[...]It's what it is, I guess.[A][N]
How about you? Are you holding[N]

I'm alright. Thank you.[A][N]
[...]You're from Dalst, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]I'm sorry for dragging you[N]
along for all of this, Arin.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What are you apologizing for?[N]
I chose to follow you.[A][N]
And so far, I'd say it has[N]
been[...] worth it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Is there anything in[N]
all of this for you?[A][N]
Are you risking yourself[N]
for nothing but my sake?[A][N][CloseEyes]
That[...] hardly feels fair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I could say the same of you.[N]
What do you stand to gain?[A][N]
Besides some vague approval from[N]
Dalst, I doubt much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fair enough. But even that[N]
has some manner of value.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's a cause you feel is right,[N]
a cause worth fighting for[...][A][N]
We'll fight for it with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]You're right. Sorry for[N]
burdening you with this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] I'm here for you.[A][N]
On that note, I found this[N]

Aye, I suppose. Talked to the[N]

And ye, it be strange. But I[N]
were gone fer so long[...][A][N]
It be alien.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In a way, it feels like I don't[N]
'ave a true home.[A][N]
The sea's great, but[...][N]

Have you been fighting too[N]
recklessly?[A] Please keep[N]
yourself a bit more safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-aye! O' course that be what[N]
happened.[A] 'Twas a real scrapper,[N]
'e was. Apologies, lass.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I just don't want you overdoing it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nae, it be all good. I'll be[N]

You don't wanna talk about[N]

[...]Alright. Good talking[N]
to you, Bechamel.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

##I6HilbertConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Hello, Miss Blair![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello there, Hilbert. [...]What's[N]
that you've got?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A sword! I've been reading some[N]
tales of heroism[...][A][N]
And they all end with a brave hero[N]
striking down a villain with a sword![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[...] Are you sure you can[N]
handle that sword?[A][N]
It seems a bit[...] large.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey! Some of these heroes defeated[N]
fell dragons when they were just 15![A][N]
I'm sure I can do it when I'm 14![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]If you insist. Just be careful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

[...]Ah. Did I keep you waiting?[N]
My apologies, milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's alright, Apollo. I presume[N]
you were praying?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Something like that. Just[...][N]
Asking for protection.[A][N]
The road ahead shall be a[N]
challenging one.[A][N]
We must all do our part[N]
to keep ourselves alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

You look exhausted, Apollo.[N]
Are you alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] fine[...] milady[...][N]
Just[...] winded[...][A][N]
Bechamel and I[...] did some exercises[...][N]
He felt I could[...] use them[...][A][N]
[...]Give me[...] a moment[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course.[A][N]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thank you. Just needed a breath.[N]
He's working me hard.[A][N]
Suppose that's not a surprise[N]
for a pirate like him.[A][N]
But[...] It'll do me good.[N]

##I6FlynnConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadFlynn][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must say, you're beyond most[N]
other swordsmen I've seen.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Have you ever heard of[N]
the Myrmidons?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that not just the common name[N]
of swift sword users?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's an interesting bit of history.[A][N]
You see, there was an ancient order of[N]
swordsmen with roots in Opistia.[A][N]
Their power was beyond anyone alive today.[A][N]
There's much debate over the source[N]
of their immense ability.[A][N]
Some say their skills were mere talent,[N]
others a gift from Opistus,[A][N]
and others still who believe it to[N]
be an effect of some grand magic.[A][N]
Have you noticed that some swordsmen[N]
we've fought are[...] attuned?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To magic? I believe I've seen[N]
something like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Myrmidons are extremely resilient[N]
towards all manners of magic.[A][N]
In any case, no matter their origins,[N]
one thing appears clear.[A][N]
The power of the Myrmidons is passed[N]
down by blood.[A] Not all inherit it,[N]
but those who do shine with potential.[A][N]
The Myrmidons have since spread and[N]
settled down all throughout the land.[A][N]
While they're rare, they can come from[N]
any nation on Ulmaron.[A][N]
Some may train for their entire lives[N]
to match the innate skill of a Myrmidon,[A][N]
but one cannot replace the attunement[N]
to the arcane with sheer force of will.[A][N]
At least, not that I know of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]From this, I'd presume you're[N]
a descendant of a Myrmidon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] hardly a big deal.[N]
Really. [...]Now I feel awkward.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Sorry for rambling there.[A][X]

##I6DesmondConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, milady. Are you well?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd say so. What of you, Desmond?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've been fine. Certainly wouldn't have[N]
expected this several months back.[A][N]
[...]I wonder if it'll ever be[N]
the same as it was.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hadn't even considered[...] What'll become[N]
of Aercolyn without an army?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I don't know. It's been so long[...][N]
I myself have failed to realize.[A][N]
It's just me and some lucky stragglers.[N]
[...]We'll have to make do, I guess.[A][N]
I doubt Dalst would charitably bolster[N]
our numbers.[A] And the state's not got[N]
the funding for a mercenary army.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This expedition'll keep that out of[N]
our minds a while longer[...][A][N]
But eventually, we'll have to face[N]
reality.[A][CloseEyes] [...]Face my failures.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]None of this was your doing.[N]
You've[...] done well, Desmond.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hardly, milady.[A][X]

##I6JeffConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Well, hello there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's quite rare for you[N]
to greet me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What? I'm not talking to you.[N]
I'm talking to this little guy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Is that a lizard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He's just a little guy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He's certainly cute.[N]
[...]This is surprising.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You caught me red-handed. No point[N]
trying to hide it now.[A][N]
Is a monster like me allowed to[N]
take pleasure in critters?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
O-of course![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Good. Now, if you'll excuse me.[N]
Beryl needs some sustenance.[A][N]
Gonna go find him some bugs.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Beryl? That's[...] a classy[N]
name for a lizard.[A][X]

##I6ButchConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
How're you doing, Butch?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well as one can be, I suppose.[N]
It's[...] mighty strange.[A][N]
We're in a desolate wasteland[...][N]
And yet I'm enjoying it.[A][N]
Is this what purpose feels like?[N]
Haven't felt this in a while.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You fought in the Revolution,[N]
correct? [...]Is it like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Suppose it is, in a sense.[A][N]
It's a different purpose, but it's[N]
a purpose nonetheless.[A][N]
Definitely beats whatever I was[N]
doing for Mevion before.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I wonder. My country's a messed[N]
up place, really.[A][N]
Brigandry, hostility, a general[N]
sense of isolation[...][A][N]
I've grown[...] used to it.[N]
And now I wish I wasn't.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, the country changed once.[N]
What says it can't again?[A][N]
Maybe not through a bloody[N]
revolution, perhaps[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]I get ya, young lady.[N]
It's not too late for us.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Thanks.[A][X]

##I6RachaelConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][OpenMidLeft]
Hey, Rachael. [...]Sorry about[N]
keeping you from Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly an issue. My prince is[N]
here, and I shall protect him.[A][N]
The king would wish it so. And I'm[N]
sure he'll be quite alright.[A][N]
The Elba Cor army is quite sizable,[N]
and quite resilient.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose so. Still[...][N]
Do you miss your home?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's an appeal to simplicity,[N]
in simply serving Couria in peace.[A][N]
But times of strife are what we must[N]
all be prepared for.[A] I shall not[N]
falter in my duty, is all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I appreciate that. You've been[N]
one of our most reliable allies.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thank you for the[N]
praise, milady.[A][N]
I shall continue to serve.[A][X]

##I6CassiusConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
[...]Damn it[...] What dastard decided[N]
to make fires so fickle?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter, Cassius?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing, really. Just[...] trying[N]
to light this blasted thing.[A][N][MoveMidRight]
[...]There we go![A][N]
Have a look at her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] quite the fire.[N]
Very big.[A][N]
[...]I'd stand back.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What're you talking about?[N]
I must revel in my fire![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm just saying.[A][N]
[...]Oh, dear.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You appear to be on fire.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see. A moment, if you will.[A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
Shitshitshitshit[...][N]
Where's the river[...]?[A][N]
[...]There we are. Welp.[N]
In we go.[A][N]
[...]*Splash!*[A][N]
[...]Damn[...] That was a mistake.[N]
[...]What's this in the river?[A][N]

[...]Probably not. But I'll be fine.[A][X]

##I6MikeyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][OpenMidLeft]
Good evening, Mikey.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks.[N]
[...]Do you need me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not particularly. Just checking in.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Do you miss Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[...] hard to answer. I don't[N]
miss fighting a senseless war.[A][N]
But[...] There's good people there.[N]
Like my sister.[A][N]
Have I mentioned her? She's something[N]
of a big deal among the army.[A][N]
I doubt you've heard the name Joan,[N]
but if you have[...] That's her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[...] That's[N]
quite impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Between the war and this journey, it's[N]
been some time since I've seen her.[A][N]
[...]Last I remember, she's seeing another woman[N]
in the army.[A] Again, I know the name[N]
means nothing to you,[A] but there's this[N]
legendary halberdier named Sonia.[A][N]
[...]Hopefully they're handling current[N]
events in Yg'stra well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Apologies for that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly your fault. It was[N]
either you or Yg'stra.[A][X]

##I6AthenaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
Young lady. I have[...] a request.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing, Athena.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I had[...] talked to someone in[N]
the army, a while back.[A][N]
And they made me realize[...][N]
My wyvern is without a name.[A][N]
I've been trying to think of one,[N]
but I've unfortunately come up short.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[...] Well, let me[N]
get a look at[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Him, I believe. If we're judging[N]
by the scale patterns.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hm[...] What's a good name for a[N]
helpful big guy like you[...]?[A][N]
How about[...] Perseus?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's a bit much, but sure.[N]
How do you feel about it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think he likes it. I'm surprised[N]
he went unnamed for so long.[A][N]
In Dalst, almost everyone names[N]
their mount immediately.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a common enough practice in Opistia.[A][N]
I guess I never felt the need. A rider and[N]
wyvern have something of an unspoken bond.[A][N]
Quantifying it with a name felt excess.[N]
But if he enjoys having a name, so be it.[A][X]

##I6CharleyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Evening, milady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, Charley.[A][N]
[...]You've been around a lot, right?[N]
Have you been to Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As a matter of fact, I have not.[A][N]
They tend not to host tournaments in[N]
barren and lifeless lands.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Right.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's funny to think about.[N]
I've been beyond the seas[...][A][N]
Lands most of us from Ulmaron would[N]
never dream of seeing in our life[...][A][N]
But I've yet to see all there[N]
is back here.[A][N]
Have you ever thought of travel?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not particularly. Before this conflict,[N]
I'd hardly ever even left Dalst.[A][N]
And once Aercolyn is restored[...][N]
I can't imagine that changing.[A][N]
Then again, I've allies in Elba Cor[N]
and Opistia now. So who knows?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just something to think about.[A][N]
If you ever feel the world's too small,[N]
there's surely a new horizon to explore.[A][X]

Frankly, when I joined ya, I expected[N]
it to be some kind o' joke.[A][N]
Like, an hour later and I'd be[N]
thrown into some river.[A][N]
But you're[...] treatin' me[N]
rather well, I say.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're one of us now, Hollandaise.[N]
That's all there is to it.[A][N]
Do you think we'd toy with you[N]
just because you were a bandit?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

You might not think it, but I[...][N]

It's slow, for sure, but it's[N]

Greetings, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Sir Hyperius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for the sir. You're leading me.[N]
But, I feel like I say this a lot.[A][N]
I am but a humble public servant.[N]
A title is of little concern to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get that[...] But you've done[N]
enough to earn that title.[A][N]
You deserve the honor that[N]
comes with it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. On an unrelated note,[N]
what do you think of His Highness?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Prince Zeke? He's a reliable ally.[N]
I'm glad to have him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A respectable opinion.[A][N]
I can tell he's pleased to have[N]
a companion of his age.[A][N]

##I6JosefConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Evening, milady! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well. What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been quite great! It's always[N]
a pleasure to ward off scum.[A][N]
Their riches shall serve a grander[N]
purpose, of keeping us supplied.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't it a little ironic[N]
to steal from bandits?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose you're not wrong.[A][N]
But gold does nothing for a corpse,[N]
and everything for a living man.[A][N]
And unfortunately, it's somewhat[N]
impractical to return this gold.[A][N]
No real way to find its [OpenQuote]rightful[N]
owner[CloseQuote] anymore.[A] So the next best[N]
thing is us using it,[A][N]
as to invest in our army and[N]
keep more people protected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough. You seem to[N]
have this all figured out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hate wasting anything. Time,[N]

of everything I can.[A][X]

##I6JosefSpecialConvo

Evening, milady! I have[N]
something to ask of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Josef?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've just been thinking about[N]
that kid[...] Hilbert.[A][N]
He's a sweet young man, and[N]
I think he looks up to me.[A][N]
I want to keep him safe,[N]
but I'm not sure what more to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] He's an anima mage[...][N]
So he'd struggle against elder magic.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Opistinian magic's good against[N]
that, right?[A] I think I have[N]
an idea.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is[...] I'm sure you[N]
could ask someone to-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Teach me light magic! You're[N]
truly something, milady.[A][N]
I'm sure he'd be glad to[N]

Again, I must thank you, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am just fulfilling His vision.[N]
No need to thank me, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So, Opistus guided you to us?[N]
[...]I thank you, Opistus.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The road ahead is a harsh one,[N]
and He wishes to guide us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I must say, though. How'd[N]
you catch up with us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course. One of Opistinia's[N]
wyvern guards deliverred me unto you.[A][N]
I would've taken Wendell, but he's[N]
been under the weather as of late.[A][N]
Once he's feeling better, perhaps[N]
he can be of assistance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wendell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My beloved wyvern, Wendell.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I didn't think of you as[N]
the type to have a wyvern.[A][N]
But[...] I guess it's not[N]
too surprising.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Ah, Blair. Are you alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. Just checking in[N]

Understandable. I've been well.[N]
Stopping here was a great move.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. [...]Well, I'm sure we'll[N]
talk again soon enough,[A][N]

##I6ZekeSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]I'm curious. How does it[N]
feel, returning to Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must admit, it's not quite[N]
what I expected I'd be doing.[A][N]
Though do remember that we're[N]
in western Holanis,[A] and I[N]
lived more in the east.[A][N]
So it's bound to feel different.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. True.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'll be interesting seeing[N]
more of the country, at least.[A][N]
Though it stings a bit not getting[N]
a chance to see my home longer.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You don't have to feel bad. It's[N]
my choice to be here,[A] and I know[N]
I'd be unsatisfied staying behind.[A][N]
But[...] I still wonder.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Hey, lady. Are you sure we[N]

your powers from?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

The rules are arbitrary and confusing.[A][N]
When I copy somebody, I don't [OpenQuote]become[CloseQuote] them,[N]
but I do gain their talents.[A][N]
Not their memories. Which[...] that's[N]
odd, right?[A] Knowing magic without[N]
having the years of training?[A][N]
It's instinctual, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How bizarre. What can[N]
you do as yourself?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A great many things, none of which[N]
I have interest in.[A][N]

What an honor. I've been well.[N]
[...]Can't say the same of my glasses.[A][N]
Blasted things keep sooting up.[N]
Makes it hard to see clearly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's unfortunate. And I'd imagine[N]
taking them off isn't an option.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unless you want me to be worthless[N]
in combat, nope.[A] I'm damned if[N]
I do and damned if I don't.[A][N]
Truly, my life's a tragedy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thankfully, it shouldn't be as[N]
bad once we're in Holanis.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can only hope. [...]Man, the fact that I'll[N]
be able to say I've been to Holanis[...][A][N]
It feels[...] better than it should.[N]
Like I'm special in some way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Well, I'll be off. Gotta go back[N]

##I6CarbonSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Good to see you, Blair![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You too, Carbon. What[N]
do you have, there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Just my sketchbook. There's a lot[N]
to see here. Makes for good practice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That makes sense. And I guess the ashen[N]
tones work out nicely for sketching.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha. I guess you're right. Though,[N]
I've got some colored implements.[A][N]
So I wouldn't mind some splashes[N]
of color here and there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I mean[...] You could always[N]
sketch one of us.[A][N]
I'd imagine my blue hair[N]
stands out quite nicely.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hm[...] You're right! If you[N]
could[...] Uh[...][A][N]
Alright, that's a good angle.[N]
Stand still a bit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I see you're chopping some firewood.[N]
Hard at work as always, Natasia.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What can I say? It's cold, and[N]
we'll need a roaring fire.[A][N]
Plus, look at me! Who's better[N]
to split some logs than I?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Say, have you written[N]

I wonder if they're worried[N]

Ayup. It's getting chilly, after all.[N]
Was just about to throw a fire up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Don't we already have several?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps. But look at all this wood[...][N]
It'll be a roaring inferno![A][N]
Those other fires will have nothing[N]

Just[...] make sure not to set[N]

Aw, relax. I've done this many[N]

Greetings, milady! How're you doing?[N]
You need anything from me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

And I've been alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. If you change your[N]
mind, just say the word.[A][N]
I've nothing else going on.[A][N]
[...]Might've already hunted us enough[N]
meat for the next four weeks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] quite impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's nothing, really. If Uncle Toby[N]

Oh, seven hours, give-or-take?[A][N]
I'm used to hunting for the[...][N]
heightened appetite.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Now I'm not sure what's[N]
more impressive here.[A][N]
You, or your uncle.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha! For sure. He's not really[N]
my uncle[...][A] But he sure did[N]
teach me all I know.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I wonder how he's doing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure he's well. He sounds[N]
like quite the[...] hearty man.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
That's not the half of it. Anyway,[N]
if you don't need me,[A] I'm gonna[N]
go polish this up.[A][N]
Found this bow while out hunting.[N]
It's such a beautiful thing[...][A][N]
Who'd just abandon it here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

##I6KennethConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...]This doesn't make sense[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing important, Blair. It's just[N]
bothering me that Holanis,[A][N]
Dalst's neighbor, is a place that[N]
I know so little about.[A][N]
A nation in shambles it may be[N]
but it's a nation nonetheless.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure a lot of nobility hardly[N]
knows of it.[A] Between the Archives[N]
and our travels, who knows?[A][N]
I may be more familiar with Holanis[N]
than Lord Arbordia![A][N]
Unless he frequents it without[N]
us knowing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Arbordia[...] He strikes me as one intimately[N]
familiar with this place.[A][N]
Don't know why. Frankly, I'm still[N]
wondering why he couldn't show up.[A][N]
You know, back in Couria.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

throw a meal together?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It never hurts to vary one's palate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Wait. Are you sure we can[N]
trust you with our food?[A][N]
Must I bring up the[N]
Coriander Incident?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Must you? If memory serves,[N]

##I6ArtemisConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
Greetings, young lady. I had been[N]
meaning to ask you something.[A][N]
[...]You knew I was from Holanis, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'd be[...] correct. I guess we could've[N]
saved some trouble by asking you things.[A][N]
Like where the army we fought came from.[A][N]
Apologies. It's been a hectic string of[N]
events, and I overlooked that option.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can appreciate being busy. Besides,[N]
as it happens, I wouldn't be much help.[A][N]
The closest thing to an army Holanis[N]
should have is in Gohranos,[A] and it's[N]
hardly enough to support an invasion.[A][N]
Many of those at the archives were[N]
mercenary in nature.[A] Technically, you[N]
could argue all Gohranians are mercenary,[A][N]
but in this case, most of those at the[N]
archives were not familiar to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[...] What does that mean? Is someone[N]
funding these mercenaries?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If only I knew. Gohranos should hardly[N]
have the coin for this kind of manpower.[A][N]
Perhaps there's another faction behind[N]
the scenes, setting this all up.[A][N]
But I've seen nothing of that in[N]
Gohranos.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[...] We can probably just continue[N]
our route as planned.[A][N]
The landmarks that're recorded[N]
in the Archives.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd agree. Of the two, I've only ever been to[N]
the Aqueduct, and only in passing.[A][N]
Can't say anything for sure of[N]
what actually happens there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright[...] Thanks, Artemis.[N]
This helped a lot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time. I'd rather not fight for[N]
a Holanis borne of the shadows.[A][X]

To bolster army morale, I thought[N]
perhaps I could regale us with a song.[A][N]
A perfect ballad came to me in a vision![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What kind of vision?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, I found some absolutely[N]
delectable berries,[A] and when I[N]
ate them,[A] the gods themselves came[N]
unto me.[A] They called me their most[N]
turpid vessel,[A] and spoke to me a[N]
song beyond mortal ken.[A][N]
And then, I woke up and found a stream[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Ah, Blair. Good to see you.[N]
I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]
I felt since we had time, I should[N]
make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[...] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[...][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]
devoted the basics of Opistinian magic[...][A][N]
It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[...][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
but I find it relaxing.[A][N]
I'll do whatever you think best.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoAnima
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd stick with what you're[N]
best at, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anima magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
On that note[...][A][N]
I think I have a strong tome somewhere.[N]
That'll be good for practice.[A][N]
Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoLight
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Light magic sounds like[N]
it could be helpful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Light magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
It'll cover anima's weakness nicely.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[...]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoDark
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I know it's not your favorite,[N]
but dark magic may help us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dark magic? Understandable.[N]
It's always good to push oneself.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[...]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvoStaves
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[...]If it's relaxing, go for[N]
some staff crafting.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Staves? Sounds good to me.[N]
I'll try to make a few.[A][N]
I believe I've ample supplies.[N]
[...]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]

##I6AvanConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAvan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
You know, when you're not constantly[N]
being attacked by bandits,[A][N]
the Lowlands are surprisingly nice.[A][N]
There's a beauty within the ashes.[N]
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
I'm[...] glad to be away from Mevion.[N]
It's nice, of course.[A][N]
But I'd much rather see all the world[N]
has to offer me.[A] Even if it means[N]
almost dying in an ashpit sometimes.[A][X]

##I6AvanSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAvan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Are you trying to light a fire?[N]
Here[...] Let me help you out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah! Thank you, Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]
One moment[...][A][N][CloseEyes][MoveMidRight]
And[...] Fire![A][N][OpenEyes]
Not a problem at all, Avan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's truly remarkable, being able to[N]
conjure a flame like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know, I could probably show you.[N]
If you're interested.[A][N]
You're already good with staves[...][N]
How hard could it be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Show me how to use magic? I'd[...][N]
I'd be honored, Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alrighty![A][N]I
'll find some time and show you the basics[N]
once I'm finished checking in with everyone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I await it with great anticipation![A][X]

##I6PeggyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I don't get it. How the[N]
hell do people live here?[A][N]
Can't do one damned thing without[N]
getting soot in every orifice.[A][N]
Least there's no shortage of[N]
goons to give a bonk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nobody would fault you if you[N]
returned to your tent.[A][N]
Feel free to take respite from[N]
the ash.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nah. It's fine. Besides, it's[N]
a rather remarkable view here.[A][N]
The moonlight[...] How it reflects off[N]
the ashen dusts[...] It's nice.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Don't tell anyone I said that, or[N]
you and my staff'll get real close.[A][X]

##I6PeggySpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]What're you swinging around[N]
there, Peggy? Is that[...] an axe?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, yes it is! Your blonde friend[...][N]
Natasia[...] She taught me a thing or two.[A][N]
Turns out swinging an axe is some[N]
good stress relief![A][N]
Plus, we need the firewood anyway.[N]
It's pretty swell all around.[A][N]
Maybe I'll teach her the basics[N]
of staffing sometime.[A][N]
I told her I wouldn't teach her[...][N]
But I could learn to teach.[A][N]
Probably.[A] Anyway, keep well,[N]
and tell her I said hello.[A][X]
##I6PeggyAxeRank
Peggy now has a[N]
D rank in axes![A][X]

##I6Opening0
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
Well[...] This'll do nicely.[A][N]
A few days of rest and[N]
preparation for the Aqueduct.[A][N]
Between it and Jraeyan[...][N]
We've quite the task ahead.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I just remembered something.[N]
I picked this up in Couria.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]A mercenary's flier?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We could probably use all[N]
the help that we can get.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's true[...][A][N]
But do we want to break our[N]
momentum towards the Aqueduct?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Maybe we hire them for Jraeyan?[A][N]
Sounds like it'd be the more well[N]
guarded of the two locations.[A][N]
Some extra help might be warranted.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That sounds reasonable.[A][N]
I have no doubts that my father[N]
would be willing to help pay.[A][N]
Shouldn't be too hard for one of[N]
our fliers to relay a message up.[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadHyperius]
Might I see that for a moment?[A][N][MoveFarLeft]
[...]Hm[...] I believe I've seen this[N]
group around, myself.[A][N]
[...]In fact, one of their numbers[N]
left their Elba Corian post.[A][N]
Hmph. Still, I can attest to their[N]
skill, if the rumors are true.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]If they're good enough for Hyperius,[N]
they're more than good enough for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright, then. I'll draft[N]
something up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sounds good. I'll go make sure[N]
everyone's settled in.[A][X]

##I6Timecard
Several days later...[X]


##I6Opening
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Whew[...] I must say, this has[N]
certainly helped me out.[A][N]
I think we all needed a break.[A][N]
And even though it's hardly luxury,[N]
there's a certain[...] quaintness.[A][N]
I'm not sure how much longer we[N]
should stay[...][A] We ought to get[N]
back on track soon.[A][N]
Before then, though[...] I should catch[N]
up with everyone.[A][N]
While I've got the chance.[N]
I'm sure they'll appreciate it.[A][X]

##I6Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]And that's that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Ah, there you are. I had just[N]
come to check in.[A][N]
I believe we're all well-rested.[N]
Shall we break camp on the morrow?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That sounds fine to me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent. On that note,[N]
our messenger returned.[A][N]
The mercs have agreed to our job,[A][N]
and have given us a date to meet.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's great news![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. But that's still quite[N]
a ways away.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Can't forget the present.[N]
[...]From here, we're near the Aqueduct.[A][N]
This[...] has done us well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Agreed. I just hope we find what we seek.[N]
If we were completely off-base[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
Who knows what could've happened to[N]
Elba Cor and Dalst?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure even if we're wrong,[N]
they'd remain standing.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]You're right. If my father could hold[N]
Elba Cor together against Yg'stra,[A][N]
he can surely hold it together against[N]
the Holanians.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And I can say the same of Lord Neillstrom.[A][N]
[...]But that's all if we're wrong.[N]
And I don't think we were.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I[...] appreciate your optimism.[N]
Sleep well, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You too, Zeke.[A][X]

##I6EndingShutUpTodd
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
[...]And that's that. [...]I fully and truly[N]
regret letting Todd play music.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Ah, there you are. I had just[N]
come to check in.[A][N]
I believe we're all well-rested.[N]
Shall we break camp on the morrow?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That sounds fine to me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
