[...]So, how does that sound?[N]
In lieu of kingdom forces,[A][N]
this young woman has volunteered[N]
to assist in your business.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hm[...] A young lass and her friends[N]
teamin' up with me to clean up Loile?[A][N]
That sounds absurd, matey![N]
[...]I like the sound o' it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm happy to hear, Cid![A][N]
And then once we're done,[N]
you'll see us to Opistia?[A][N][OpenRight]
Aye, lass. I be a man o' word.[A][N]
[...]Plus, if I were to turn tail,[N]
Brandl 'ere would have me head![A][N]
Gwar harr harr![A] He be interesting[N]
for sure.[A] Who's ever heard o' a[N]
king gettin' chummy wit' pirates?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Thank you, Cid.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Anyway, once you've finished, Cid[N]
will take you to Port Moneubris.[A][N]
Unfortunately, I can't offer much[N]
else in the way of manpower.[A][N]
Not while trying to fend off[N]
the Yg'stran invasion.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Everything you've given me already[N]
is more than enough, your majesty.[A][N]
[...]Once this war is finally over,[N]
I'll make sure to return.[A][N]
Our lands will need to recuperate,[A][N]
and formally establishing relations[N]
would do us much good.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I agree. Well, then.[N]
Safe travels.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Perhaps[...] Perhaps it truly is time[N]
for Elba Cor to open its doors again.[A][N]
[...]What have these past 12 years been for?[A][X]

[...]Are you quite sure offering to[N]
do this was the best idea?[A][N][OpenRight]
His Majesty surely would gladly[N]
assist you without[...] this.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, maybe I am in over my head.[A][N]
But if the king is offering to help[N]
us, I can't just give nothing in return![A][N]
Besides, this isn't too severe a detour.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I'm sure the old man appreciates it.[N]
And this'll be a chance to see Cid in action.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Gwah hah hah! Righty-o, lad![A][N]
You be almost as mad as me for[N]
doin' this, lass![A] I like[N]
yer attitude.[A][N][OpenLeft]
See? We'll be fine.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
If you say so. I believe we're nearing[N]
the sacred grounds.[A] It's quite dark,[N]
so be careful out there.[A][N]
If we want to do this right,[N]
we'll need to rout them all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll do me best to leave 'em kickin'.[N]
Gotta let the youngsters have some.[A][N]
But if things get rough, don't be[N]
afraid to let me go wild.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'm sure you'll get to unleash[N]
the fury, sir![A][X]

[...]Are you quite sure offering to[N]

The king was ready and willin'[N]
to help you for free, after all.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, maybe I am in over my head.[A][N]
But if the king is offering to help[N]
us, I can't just give nothing in return![A][N]
Besides, this isn't too severe a detour.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Very well. I suppose there's no stopping[N]
you once you're set on something.[A][N]
In any case, this will be a chance[N]
to evaluate our new ally's skill.[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]

This'll be but a brief diversion.[A][N]
Besides, after what happened to[N]
the king's knights[...][A][N]
[...]We owe this to the kingdom.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Very well, Blair.[A][N]

##Ch8_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
That's all of them, lass.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellently done, everyone.[A][N][OpenRight]
I still don't quite see what[N]
this accomplished,[A][N]
but I suppose that's neither[N]
here nor there.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, sometimes ya' don't need to[N]
think about those things.[A][N]
To me, there be a right way and a wrong[N]
way to live a life o' crime.[A][N]
An' these folks chose poorly.[A][N]
Anyhoot, well done. My services[N]
are yers, lass.[A] We're off to[N]
Moneubris, and from there, Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Onwards, then![A][X]

##C8EsmeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Why are you doing this?[N]
We're just trying to live.[A][N]
You're the ones who cast us[N]
out into the proverbial fire![A][X]

##C8EsmeRachaelBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
Wait[...] I recognize you.[N]
You're Esme, correct?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Ah, one of the king's dogs?[A][N]
What, have you come to drive[N]
us out of [OpenQuote]sacred grounds[CloseQuote]?[A][N]
Don't give me that. You know[N]
we've been cast out.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][CloseEyes]
[...]It is the duty of a knight[N]
to serve their liege.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[...]There's truly nothing left[N]
for you. Goodbye.[A][X]

##C8EsmeCassiusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Those colors[...] So, the king[N]
did send you after all.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
So what if he did?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Your kind and your blind[N]
obedience sicken me.[A][N]
We're a people suffering[N]
here, and we get no sympathy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius][CloseEyes]
[...]I can't fix the world order.[N]
All I can do is my duty.[A][X]

##C8EsmeCidBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[...]Should've known it'd be you.[N]
You're the lowliest scum.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
What, fer cleanin' up the[N]
mess o' the world?[A][N]
Me an' me boys are nothin'[N]
like ye.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
Pretending you're something[N]
above us[...][A][N]
Something more than a killer.[N]
A plundering opportunist.[A][N]
What lets you escape that?[A][N]
And what consigns us, who[N]
just wish to survive, to that?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Life's simply unfair.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadEsme]
[...]People like you are why[N]
world will never be just.[A][X]


##C8EsmeDeath
