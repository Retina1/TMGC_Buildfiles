[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Welcome to the bonus conversations![A][N]
I'm Retina, the guy who made the[N]
hack you're playing right now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or that you're watching an LP[N]
of right now.[A][N]
Anyway, this section of the event[N]
viewer is dedicated to odds and ends.[A][N]
Whether that be development trivia,[N]
highly-staged interviews,[A][N]
or just some old-fashioned shitposts.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. Does saying that violate FEU's[N]
content guidelines?[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Eh. It's[N]
probably fine.[A][N]
Anyway, thanks for checking this out,[N]
and I'll see you in a future conversation.[A][N]
As I always say, goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus2
The Original Sin[X]

##BonusConvo2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The concepts in this hack go back[N]
to my high school days.[A][N]
Before I even knew what a builder was,[N]
I drafted up ideas[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that sucked.[A][N]
Younger me thought an 80 chapter campaign[N]
with 7 acts was an acceptable length.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]49 chapters is very[N]
reasonable, I swear.[A][N]
Names for a lot of characters originated[N]
either in .txt files,[A] or in a list that[N]
I typed on a graphing calculator.[A][N]
I don't get it either.[A][N]
Fast forward a few years, and as I[N]
was developing Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
these all re-emerged in my head,[N]
and were eventually placed in a ROM.[A][N]
Nothing ever happened to said ROM,[N]
since I quickly moved to buildfiles.[A][N]
Some older concepts included Hyperius[N]
and Damien as possible lords,[A][N]
Viridian and Blair's parties coming[N]
to blows,[A] and Elcorian having had[N]
a role in Mevion's revolution.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The old drafts were weird.[A][N]
Viridian's party didn't even exist in[N]
the buildfiles for quite some time.[A][N]
And some characters, like Yuyu, were[N]
spur of the moment additions,[A][N]
unlike the very carefully planned[N]
out original cast.[A][N]
If you open up the ROM in Builder,[A][N]
every unit after Elcorian's slot was[N]
conceived after development began,[A][N]
while everyone before him was planned[N]
from the very beginning.[A][N]
One last tidbit for now: instead of[N]
Kenneth and Natasia,[A] there was[N]
originally Vincent and Kenny.[A][N]
Yes, Vincent was the dark mage and[N]
Kenny was the fighter.[A][N]
Anyways, that's all for now.[N]
Thank you, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus3
Gameplay Inspirations[X]

##BonusConvo3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
I joke about my first full hack,[N]
Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
being a bootleg Souls of the Forest,[N]
but honestly, that's a misnomer.[A][N]
Trying to quantify a hack as a[N]
[OpenQuote]blank-like[CloseQuote] is reductive.[A][N]
In any case, I was inspired by fast[N]
paced player phase design,[A][N]
and sought to further polish my[N]
style in TMGC.[A][N]
My philosophy on skills was inspired[N]
by Vision Quest,[A] though they're more[N]
impactful and common here.[A][N]
Hacks like Cerulean Coast and Eternal[N]
Winter also inspired how I use skills,[A][N]
in the sense that they made me realize[N]
how absolutely insane they could get.[A][N]
Really, if you want to make a hack,[A][N]
you shouldn't worry about being[N]
like anything.[A] Experiment a bit,[N]
and find what works best for you.[A][N]
Vanilla stats, inflation, deflation[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They're all valid ways to design.[A][N]
Anyhoot, that's enough for now.[N]
Godspeed, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus4
Aesthetics[X]

##BonusConvo4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Aesthetics are hard to talk about,[N]
especially since I'm no artist.[A][N]
The only mug of mine in the hack that[N]
hasn't been heavily redone is Ptolemy.[A][N]
Still, I sometimes splice things,[N]
and that's a valuable experience.[A][N]
Don't get too hung up on your hack's[N]
visual identity at first.[A][N]
If it's something people enjoy,[N]
you're bound to eventually meet people[N]
willing to help polish its look.[A][N]
That being said, I've felt creating[N]
an identity to be extremely rewarding.[A][N]
The menus are obviously a major part[N]
of that, and unfortunately,[A][N]
for many people (myself included),[N]
making menus is mind-bending.[A][N]
Luckily, our community has many[N]
people willing to help with this.[A][N]
I don't want to come off sounding[N]
like some shill,[A] but the assets[N]
I've commissioned from Scraiza are,[A][N]
without hyperbole, absolutely[N]
incredible.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel I've lost my[N]
train of thought here.[A][N]
Are aesthetics important, or no?[A][N]
I'd say yes, but at the end of the[N]
day, gameplay is more important.[A][N]
Well, then. Until next time.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart1
Prologue - Ch. 5[X]

##BonusConvoPart1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The start of a game can be one[N]
of the hardest things to design.[A][N]
At once you have to balance easing[N]
the player into a new world,[A][N]
introducing the context you need,[N]
and establishing WHAT your game is.[A][N]
All that considered, I think the[N]
earlygame's pretty alright.[A][N]
Some don't like earlygames with[N]
small casts, and that's alright.[A][N]
So I definitely get why some people[N]
don't like Prologue and Chapter 1,[A][N]
though for me, Chapter 1's a favorite.[A][N]
It's a challenging map that forces[N]
you to cleverly use a very small,[A][N]
very weak cast, and it forces you[N]
to prioritize what loot you want.[A][N]
I don't have too much to say on 2 or 3,[A][N]
though one of my playtesters convinced[N]
me to add that Quixotic scroll.[A][N]
Chapter 4's the first map that really[N]
forces you to play somewhat fast,[A][N]
and I think I managed to get the[N]
pace feeling natural.[A][N]
Chapter 5's the first fog map.[A][N]
I actually like fog, so one of my[N]
goals was to make good fog maps.[A][N]
I know, real controversial.[N]
[OpenQuote]Make a good map.[CloseQuote][A][N]
I like little touches in 5, like the[N]
visible soldier with a killer lance,[A][N]
or the boss endangering the topmost[N]
torch on Lunatic,[A] and I think[N]
it shows that fog CAN work well.[A][N]
As for earlygame writing, it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
alright.[A][N]
For all it's built up as, Mevion[N]
basically functions as earlygame bandits.[A][N]
Yg'stra doesn't get much yet, and[N]
Lazarus isn't particularly deep.[A][N]
But, it sets up an alright conflict,[N]
sets up Elba Cor's involvement,[A][N]
and spreads lore out in a manageable way.[A][N]
In general, I like Tellius's style of[N]
introducing countries not all at once,[A][N]
but rather as they become important.[A][N]
It feels more natural and breaks up[N]
an otherwise minutes long loredump.[A][N]
I also think the moment-to-moment[N]
character interactions are great,[A][N]
and that will hold true in general.[A][N]
I'm far better at dialogue than[N]
plotting, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be warned, I guess?[A][N]
Thanks for reading,[N]
and goodnight gamers.[A][X]
