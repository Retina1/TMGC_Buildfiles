Well, it's been quite some time[N]
since I wrote in this thing![N]
Since I've little better to[N]
do on the road to Arbordia,[N]
why not chronicle my thoughts?[N]
[N]
It's been a few months since[N]
my graduation from the[N]
Northern Arbordian academy,[N]
and I thought it'd be quite[N]
some time before my return[N]
to the capital. Imagine my[N]
surprise at an urgent[N]
notice from Sir Elcorian![N]
Perhaps the relegitimization[N]
of Aercolyn is nigh?[N]
[N]
Accompanying me on this road is[N]
Arin, my close friend.[N]
We both went to the academy[N]
together, and have known each[N]
other longer than I remember.[N]
...Not sure why she felt the need[N]
to come, but how can I say no?[N]
[N]
We should arrive within a few[N]
day's travel, now. Maybe I'll[N]
finally be able to prove myself,[N]
and escape the shadow of my[N]
father's deeds...[X]

## Chapt1Diary
After fighting off some rebels,[N]
we met with Sir Elcorian.[N]
The road of relegitimization[N]
will be long and challenging,[N]
but I'm sure all will end well.[N]
[N]
As my first task (I suppose[N]
to prove loyalty?), we've[N]
been sent near the Mevion[N]
border, as there have been[N]
reports of conflict.[N]
From what I understand,[N]
Mevion takes quite an[N]
aggressive approach to[N]
their [OpenQuote]neutrality,[CloseQuote] so[N]
we need to be ready[N]
for anything.[N]
[N]
According to my map, this[N]
all appears to be happening[N]
quite close to a village[N]
a dear friend lives in.[N]
Hopefully she's faring well-[N]
it'd be lovely to see[N]
her again.[X]

## Chapt2Diary
Not much time to write.[N]
Yg'stra's invading, despite[N]
recent negotiations.[N]
[N]
We're the only ones who can[N]
make any kind of meaningful[N]
impact now, which is[N]
honestly a little terrifying.[N]
[N]
No matter what, we won't[N]
give up. I can't lose[N]
everything again.[X]

Was it truly the right choice?[N]
Who can say? When the world is[N]

So, this illness may be my[N]
