'Ey, cap'n. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
wanted to thank ye.[A][N]
Fer givin' me another chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do ye mean, lad?[N]
I didn't choose ye.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I know. But still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
In the short time I've known[N]
yer crew, it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, it's been wonderful.[A][N]
Na' to speak ill o' Pete,[N]
but 'e was a bastard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, 'e was. Him and I go way back.[N]
A good pirate, but nae a [OpenQuote]good[CloseQuote] pirate.[A][N]
That be somethin' I've learned.[A][N]
There's a difference between a righteous[N]
freedom an' a ruthless chaos.[A][N]
I'll admit, lad. I 'ave done many[N]
terrible things in my day.[A][N]
But then, I realized[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It don't[N]
have to be that way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see what ye mean.[A][N]
This life be our birthright, yet we[N]
don't hafta live in its shadow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why Pete ne'er became more[N]
than what he was.[A] The man clung[N]
to dreams o' a bygone age.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad to be 'ere. To have[N]
a chance to do some good.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Cap'n. Take this gem, and[N]
give it to someone important.[A][N]
It's 'ardly anythin', but it'll do[N]
the others more good than it'd do me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, lad. Yer a fine man.[N]
Perhaps one day this crew'll be yers.[A][X]

##C10_Rachael_Jeff_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. What do you want?[N]
Come to laugh in a sinner's face?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I beg your pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't give me that. I know your type.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've robbed your type blind.[A][N]
You think you're high and mighty[N]
for servin' some king.[A][N]
That you have some sort of moral[N]
authority from which to judge me.[A][N]
Well, I'm an irredeemable wretch![N]
What will you do about it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not quite[N]
what I came for.[A][N]
I just thought you an appropriate[N]
partner to train with,[A] given[N]
how swift we are.[A][N]
But do you really think all[N]
of us are like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you serve someone higher than yourself,[N]
you're betraying human nature.[A][N]
And in the name of what, may I ask?[A][N]
I may be scum, but at least[N]
I serve nobody but myself.[A][N]
At least I'm not perpetuating[N]
society's lies.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Would it be remiss to mention[N]
that you're serving this army?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And now I'm being made out as a[N]
god damned hypocrite.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, I AM one, but the whole[N]
point of being one is NOT admitting it![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hope you're happy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What did I just listen to?[A][N]
He's wrong, anyway. Our king is a just man.[N]
Serving him is a brilliant purpose.[A][X]

##C10_Sam_Emile_Base
[OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What if I try a reinforced[N]
shaft[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Wait, that wouldn't work[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Flexibility's still a must, after all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight]
Accursed Ciraweissian wood[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Too pliable for its own good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wha-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
S-sorry, sorry! Did I[N]
i-interupt you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N]
I'll j-just go now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
It's alright.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sam? Where'd you go?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSam]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Well, what did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I j-just noticed you deep in thought.[N]
What's that sketch, there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm trying to figure out a design[N]
for this staff prototype.[A][N]
The problem is this particular staff's[N]
magic is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite rigorous.[A][N]
Our first attempt at harnessing it[N]
violently shattered its shaft.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I still might have[N]
a splinter or two from that.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out[N]
a way to avoid that.[A][N]
As you might've overheard, Ciraweissian[N]
wood has failed me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Out of curiousity, what's your[N]
bow made out of?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't quite know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough. If it's not any trouble,[N]
I wouldn't mind having a look at it.[A][N]
After all, for it to retain its shape[N]
after being repeatedly fired[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This might be the inspiration[N]
I need.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really? It'd help that much?[N]
I'm glad to hear that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This could lead to a breakthrough![A][N]
You can be a bit more enthusiatic[N]
than that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
S-sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No need to apologize.[N]
Again.[A][X]


##C10_Apollo_Bechamel_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Ah, Bechamel. What do you[N]
require of me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I be wonderin'[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Ya see, I wanna[N]
try and do somethin' wit' me life.[A][N]
Somethin' more than piracy, I mean.[A][N]
I thought I could perhaps help[N]
map out the old seas.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's a brilliant idea.[A][N]
It's a net gain for humanity, while[N]
also being a way to live your passions.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Thing is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I never learnt ta'[N]
read or write.[A] Tha' strikes me as[N]
a bit important fer this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see where this is going,[N]
and I'd be happy to help.[A][N]
In fact, let me check my satchel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidRight]
Aha! Here. This is a remedial guide[N]
to the modern tongue. I have several.[A][N]
You can have one. Obviously, it's nothing[N]
compared to actual teaching,[A][N]
but it's a start.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do ye carry that around?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You never know if your missions shall[N]
have you spread word to the illiterate.[A][N]
These guides are like seeds. Plant them[N]
in the common man,[A] and they shall[N]
reap the reward of knowledge.[A][N]
And if said knowledge happens to[N]
help them connect to Opistus,[A][N]
that's all the better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Me thinks I get it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, when we've the spare time,[N]
I shall tutor you personally.[A][N]
Nothing beats that connection.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank ye, matey. Once again,[N]
yer turnin' me life around.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Opistus teaches us to see the[N]
good in man, and you're a good man.[A][N]
For those who seek it, there[N]
will be salvation.[A][X]

##C10_Stefan_Desmond_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond][OpenMidLeft]
Sir Desmond! How do you fare?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been better, I'll admit.[N]
Especially give current events.[A][N]
But that's not going to stop me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well spoken, sir! It's in adversity[N]
that we all must hold fast.[A][N]
We must never let down our guard.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never's a strong word. Hopefully,[N]
we'll one day see peace again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even in peace, we[N]
must be ready for anything.[A][N]
After all, didn't the peace we knew[N]
shatter in a mere instant?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alas, I suppose you're right.[N]
Still, must we carry on like this?[A][N]
I'm sure there must be some path[N]
that ends in a lasting security.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We all wish that, sir.[N]
But to achieve that, we must fight on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. That is our duty[N]
as knights of Aercolyn.[A][N]
Let us never forget that.[A][X]

##C10_Sam_Josef_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
You alright there, Sam?[N]
Things've been hectic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I'm holding[N]
up. A bit.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You sure? You sound a bit tense.[N]
Need to shoot me to release stress?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate the thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But now's not the time.[A][N]
I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nervous, alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's only natural. After all, we're[N]
in quite the hellish position.[A][N]
There's a significant chance that[N]
we will all die out here, and-[A][N]
Wait, that's probably not helping.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]*Sniff!*[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Everything will be fine.[N]
You've got me at your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
