[...]We're finally home.[N]
For real this time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We[...] really are.[A][N]
[...]I never thought this was[N]
how our journey would go.[A][N]
But[...] I'm truly thankful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Normally, I'd ask what would[N]
happen from here.[A][N]
Where we'd be after this war.[A][N]
But[...] I know that no matter[N]
what, we'll be alright.[A][N]
[...]That's a comfort I've not[N]
ever truly had.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And it is one we shall truly[N]
make the most of.[A][N]
[...]This truly is bliss.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]It truly is.[A][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadYuyu]
[...]I call dibs.[A][N][OpenRight]
On what, exactly?[A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Everything ever.[A][N]
[...]Too late to complain.[N]
Should've been quicker.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Is[...] that something you can do?[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
Well, she just did, and[N]
none of us stopped her.[A][N]
[...]I say it's fair.[A][N][OpenRight]
Might you be willing to share[N]
some of your dibs, Yuyu?[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadYuyu]
[...]Maybe.[N]
[...]I'll trade you.[A][N]
An embrace most tender[N]
for one dibs.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadNatasia]
[...]One dibs? How[...] How[N]
much is that?[A][N]
What does that mean?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Try your luck.[N]
Find out.[A][N][OpenRight]
'Twould be a simply unfair exchange[N]
were we to not know its value.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I called dibs on everything ever.[N]
Do you think I care about fairness?[A][N][OpenRight][LoadAvan]
Don't worry. I'll take you up[N]
on that offer, Yuyu.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's one lucky customer.[N]
[...]Any other takers?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
You, Blair? You look like[N]
you're dying for a deal.[A][N]
[...]Not literally, I mean.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'm just thinking. It's really[N]
finally hitting me.[A][N]
We[...] We made it. We get to just[...][N]
be whimsical like this.[A][N]
We've fought hard for our peace and[N]
happiness[...][A] And I've finally[N]
realized that now we live in it.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Well, we sure as heck deserve it![A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadEstelle]
Our trials have indeed proven us[N]
worthy of exultation and elation.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadArin]
I've never thought about happiness[N]
as something you earn[...][A][N]
But I will gladly embrace it after[N]
our endless journey.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Perhaps it won't last forever.[A][N]
Even so, we'll face any tomorrow[N]
together with pride.[A][N]
But for now, let us bask in[N]
the joy we feel in this moment![A][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadNatasia]
Make sure to bring whatever[N]
you think you'll need.[A][N]
Bechamel and I made sure to[N]
leave a spacious cargo hold.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Still kinda surprised all of[N]
you are alright with this.[A][N][OpenRight]
Traveling the open seas with[N]
the women that I love?[A][N]
There is simply nothing more[N]
romantic fathomable![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
A fresh start[...] sounds nice.[A][N]
And this is as fresh a[N]
start as I can imagine.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadYuyu]
Plus, I could totally nail being[N]
a pirate.[A] Already used to this[N]
hair leaving me half-blind.[A][N]
An eyepatch wouldn't be all[N]
that much different.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
I truly never thought I'd see the[N]
day I joyously become a pirate.[A][N]
[...]Truly, this is another wonder of the[N]
world that I'm lucky enough to witness.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I[...] somehow don't think we're[N]
becoming a band of pirates.[A][N]
We're simply joining Nat on her[N]
seafaring adventures for a while.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm sure I'll tire of the sea[N]
one day.[A] We can all retire[N]
together then.[A][N]
[...]Then again, maybe with you[N]
all along[...][A] Maybe it'll never[N]
manage to get old.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Guess Stelle'll need to finally[N]
learn how to swim.[A] Wouldn't want[N]
her accidentally lost at sea.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadEstelle]
[...]You present that as an unreasonable[N]
challenge. But I'm certain I shall prevail.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
Ha! Ever the optimist.[A][N]
[...]Don't worry. We'll give you[N]
a hand, Stelle.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's easier than it looks.[A][N]
And we'd never let you drown.[N]
We're[...][A] Well, we're each and[N]
every one of us.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArin]
[...]Are you quite sure that[N]
means anything, Natasia?[A][N][OpenLeft]
I get what she's trying to say.[A][N]
[...]It's truly dawning on me now[N]
how lucky I[...] We all are.[A][N]
Six of us, together. Creating a[N]
future we all wish for.[A][N]
No matter where we go, we'll[N]
have each other.[A][N]
And together, I know we can[N]
truly do anything.[A][X]


##Epilogue_NatasiaAercolynLover
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][ToggleSmile]
[...]You sure you're alright with[N]
leaving this place for me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, love. It'd hardly be fair[N]
for me to get in the way of your dreams.[A][N]
And this place will always be here if we[N]
do wish to return eventually.[A][N]
There'll always be a home for us to[N]
come back to.[A] I say we use that[N]
assurance to do anything we wish.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well, then. Let's have ourselves[N]
the adventure of a lifetime![A][N]
The world's massive, and I know[N]
there's so much I want to see.[A][N]
And there's so much I've already[N]
seen[...] that I want to show you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm excited for it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That said, I'm not in a massive[N]
rush to be away from this all.[A][N]
I won't say I wouldn't mind a bit[N]
of time to relax in luxury.[A][N]
We're the champions of the world.[N]
We deserve to treat ourselves![A][N]
Once we're ready, though[...][N]
Look out world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For now, let us simply enjoy[N]
this moment together.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I can do that, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_AvanAercolynLover
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan][ToggleSmile]
We're[...] We're finally here.[A][N]
The end of our journey.[N]
Our well-earned rest.[A][N]
[...]Sometimes, I feel I've seen[N]
many of the world's wonders.[A][N]
And yet, at others I feel I've[N]
hardly seen anything.[A][N]
But[...] Being here with you[...][N]
That's a wonder all its own.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We can always have both.[A][N]
I, myself[...] There's so much left[N]
in Ulmaron to experience.[A][N]
I began this whole campaign trying[N]
to find my place in Dalst.[A][N]
But maybe[...] It's never been[N]
here at all.[A] Now I know that[N]
it's by your side.[A][N]
Of course, we'll always have a[N]
home here. A place to return.[A][N]
But we have the power to do[N]
whatever we wish.[A] Go wherever[N]
we wish to go.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We're[...] truly the luckiest[N]
people alive.[A][N]
[...]I've some flowers I wish to[N]
plant.[A] They'll be proof of who[N]
we truly are. What we've done.[A][N]
[...]Would you care to join me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, love.[A][X]

##Epilogue_YuyuAercolynLover
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu][ToggleSmile]
[...]Yeah. This is nice.[N]
I could get used to this.[A][N]
[...]Not just cause of the[N]
luxury, mind you.[A][N]
[...]Not that I mind it.[A][N]
But you're better than that.[N]
Than anything else here.[A][N]
Anything else in the world.[A][N]
[...]Sorry. Got a bit lost in[N]
my ramblings.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing to apologize for.[N]
[...]It's cute, Yuyu.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So it is.[A] [...]Nothing much to[N]
do now.[A] Normally I'd hate[N]
that kind of inaction.[A][N]
[...]For once, I'm content.[A][N]
[...]Gonna go take a nap.[N]
If you wish to join me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be right there![A][N]
[...]Peace and contentment.[N]
[...]At long last.[A][X]


##Epilogue_EstelleAercolynLover
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][ToggleSmile]
Hm[...] I truly do believe you[N]
would dazzle in this role.[A][N]
[...]If you so wish, of course.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're still searching through[N]
your script collection?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But of course. Now that we're[N]
the rest of our lives ahead,[A][N]
I wish to finally show you all[N]
I know of my arts.[A][N]
Your divinity is more than any[N]
stage deserves to behold,[A][N]
and so I seek a part of that[N]
same heavenly quality.[A][N]
Of course, we have a lifetime[N]
to figure all this out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Now that I think of it, there's[N]
a theatre in Aercolyn.[A] I forgot[N]
to show it to you before the siege,[A][N]
but I think it's still open.[A][N]
[...]Shall we see what they have[N]
in store, my love?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] would love nothing more.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ArinAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]We've made it at last.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To think of everything that[N]
came from our adventure[...][A][N]
It's almost impossible to[N]
truly believe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet, it happened.[A][N]
[...]I won't pretend to know[N]
what comes next for us.[A][N]
But I shall continue to[N]
remain at your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm glad. I know[...] that together,[N]
anything is possibe for us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][ToggleSmile]Truly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's the first I've truly seen[N]
you smile in a long time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose so.[A][N]
[...]The future ahead is uncertain.[N]
But[...] I'm unafraid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I feel the same way.[A][N]
Whatever comes, we'll face it[N]
as the closest of friends.[A][X]

##Epilogue_YuyuAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu]
Arbordia's finished.[N]
I'm satisfied.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
What now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dunno. I just figure things[N]
might get boring here.[A][N]
[...]Then again, you're pretty[N]
fun to be around.[A] Guess you're[N]
stuck with me indefinitely.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadBlair]
[...]Gonna run off and collect[N]
some taxes now.[A] Toodles![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Goodness. [...]At least she's happy.[A][X]

##Epilogue_AvanAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan]
I'll likely be off again[N]
before long, Blair.[A][N]
But I wouldn't mind at least[N]
a bit more time here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're welcome to remain[N]
as long as you'd like.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I truly appreciate it.[A][N]
Now that we're in peacetime,[N]
I can truly appreciate Dalst.[A][N]
It's a lovely land. Much more[N]
vibrant than my home.[A][N]
I won't say I don't ever miss[N]
Mevion,[A] but I'd miss the rest[N]
of the world if I never left.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps if there's time later,[N]
you could show me around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd be delighted, Avan.[A][X]

##Epilogue_EstelleAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
A glorious day has finally[N]
dawned upon us.[A][N]
[...]I wish to write of what[N]
has all happened.[A][N]
The story of this conflict is[N]
one worth retelling.[A][N]
To that, I think I shall remain[N]
here for a time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you ever need anything[N]
from me,[A] I'll see what I can[N]
do. Even if it's just talking.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But of course. You have many[N]
stories to share.[A][N]
Those which you are willing shall[N]
breathe greater life into my art.[A][N]
[...]Until then, may you be graced[N]
with care and pleasure, Lady Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_CarbonAercolynAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
[...]What's that look for?[A][N]
You can't rush art, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'm hardly rushing you.[A][N]
Just[...] trying to get a good[N]
look at what you're sketching.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd rather it be something of[N]
a surprise.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If I'm entrusting you with some[N]
grand public mural,[A] I'm not[N]
sure I'd want it a total surprise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fair. [...]Here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Looks good so far.[A][N]
[...]Your figure's a bit[...][N]
idealized.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I like to think that I've earned[N]
some of it through the war.[A][N]
Besides, ain't that art?[A][N]
An ideal reality?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I guess it is.[A][N]
[...]Still, I think this part where[N]
you're fighting off, what,[A] seventy[N]
men on your own[...][A][N]
That feels a bit[...] much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fair enough.[A][N]
I'll[...] workshop the[N]
sketches a bit more.[A][N]
Rest assured, they'll be[N]
good. You'll see, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_CarbonAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon][OpenMidLeft]
What're you still doing[N]
here, Carbon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Figured I'd hang around a bit.[N]
Might've told you.[A][N]
[...]I'll forgive you for forgetting.[N]
It's been chaotic around here.[A][N]
But, yeah. No rush to return[N]
home to Yg'stra at this point.[A][N]
I'll let that situation sort out[N]
a bit.[A] Not like I'd be able to[N]
do much for the reconstruction.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry. I can put myself[N]
to work here if needs must.[A][N]
Plus[...] There's some nice[N]
landscapes here.[A] Might try[N]
and paint something again.[A][N]
If you've any in mind,[N]
come and find me.[A][N]
[...]Carbon, out.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ah.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JohanPtolemyAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadJohan][OpenFarRight][LoadPtolemy][OpenMidLeft]
Are the two of you[N]
staying in Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
At least for a little while.[A][N]
Maybe we'll leave eventually,[N]
but right now we need stability.[A][N][OpenRight]
There are[...] many wounds that[N]
still need to heal.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]They will heal easier at[N]
your side, of course.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That is all I can hope.[A][N]
[...]The flowers are lovely this[N]
time of year.[A] Would you like[N]
to go and see them?[A][N][OpenRight]
That sounds perfect.[A][N]
[...]Take care, milady.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JohanAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
[...]Milady. I am[...][N]
glad you're alright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How[...] are you holding up, Johan?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Far from the greatest.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I thought that things would[N]
be better once I was back.[A][N]
I[...] I'm not so sure of that[N]
anymore.[A] Nothing can ever[N]
be the same again.[A][N]
[...]I'm[...] sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
There's nothing you need[N]
apologize for, Johan.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for your[N]
service to Aercolyn.[A][N]
If you wish to take a break,[N]
take as long as you need.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] I might.[A][X]

##Epilogue_DesmondFlynnAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadDesmond][OpenFarRight][LoadFlynn]
[...]It's quite nice here.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
That it is. There's a reason[N]
I'm proud of Aercolyn.[A][N]
And you're now another one[N]
among those reasons.[A][N]
Your skills will do wonders[N]
for the men of Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm[...] glad to hear.[N]
And to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you'll be training our knights,[N]
we can all rest that much sounder.[A][N]
I'm glad to have you, Flynn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You[...] flatter me, milady.[A][N]
But I shall do my best[N]
to share my passion.[A][N][OpenRight]
You're shown me much already.[A][N]
I have faith that you'll be able[N]
to inspire all of Aercolyn.[A][N]
[...]Take care, Lady Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_DesmondAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
[...]Our work has truly just begun,[N]
Lady Blair.[A] The war's over, but[N]
that isn't enough for true peace.[A][N]
[...]Daunting as the path ahead may[N]
truly be,[A] I like to think that[N]
I am capable of pursuing it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You are, Sir Desmond. You're half[N]
the reason we ever got this far.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps that's overselling me[N]
a little.[A] But I do appreciate[N]
the faith you hold all the same.[A][N]
And I shall do all that I can to[N]
ensure it is a faith not misplaced.[A][N]
[...]Aercolyn shall be the best that[N]
I can make it. I swear it.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ToddsworthAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth]
[...]Weird question. Mind if I[N]
stay here a while?[A][N]
[...]Not here as in this castle.[N]
But here as in the city.[A][N]
I think I could make something[N]
of a name for myself here.[A][N]
[...]That guy who helped your lady[N]
save all your lives.[A][N]
Something like that.[N]
[...]You like that idea?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] hardly need permission[N]
to live here, Toddsworth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wait, really?[A] [...]Now I feel[N]
stupid for asking.[A][N]
In that case, I'll find the[N]
nearest abandoned house,[A][N]
and unpack everything I own.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Buh-bye![A][X]

##Epilogue_StefanAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
To think of the highs and the[N]
lows this journey's brought[...][A][N]
I'm[...] truly grateful to have[N]
fought for you, Lady Blair.[A][N]
And until the day I fall, I'll[N]
remain at your beck and call![A][N]
[...]Didn't even mean for it to[N]
sound so poetic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ha. You've already done more[N]
than your share for Aercolyn.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I know encouraging you to[N]
take it easy won't change you.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for everything, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It is simply the least I could[N]
do, Lady Blair.[A] [...]By your leave.[N]
There's still much to be done.[A][X]
