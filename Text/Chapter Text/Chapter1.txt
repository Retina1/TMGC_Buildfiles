[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Hm[...] I don't think anyone's home.[N]
Maybe there's something helpful inside.[A][N]
I feel a bit bad about this, but[...][N]
Well, I'm sure they'd understand.[A][X]

##C1Signal2
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]Nothing helpful, it seems.[N]
Nobody's been here for a while.[A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[...]This window leads to the roof.[N]
Might be a nice observation point.[A][X]

##C1Signal3
[OpenRight][LoadBlair]
[...]This is a fine view. Though,[N]
I shouldn't stay here too long.[A][N]
Don't want to make myself an[N]
easy target for archers.[A][N]
[...]Wait[...] That village over there[...][N]
Is that[...] Natasia's?[A][N]
[...]I almost didn't realize![A][N]
[...]Hm[...] I wonder.[N]
Let me try something.[A][N][CloseEyes][MoveRight]
[...]Hyah![A][X]

*Whoosh! Shimmer!*[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Man. Didn't know the Mevs[N]
had a magician out there.[A][N]
They must really be tryin' today.[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
[...]Wait[...] That's[...] not like[N]
any normal magic.[A][N]
[...]Is[...] Blair fighting out there?![A][N][ToggleSmile]
Well, then[...] Looks like I'm up![N]
I can't possibly sit by now![A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
Here I come![A][X]

##Ch1_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[OpenMidRight]
Lady Blair.[N]
It's been[...] some time.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir Elcorian![A][N]
It truly has been a long time.[N]
Why have I been called here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Obviously, after your father's[N]
actions,[A] the status of Aercolyn[N]
has been[...] dubious, shall we say.[A][N]
However, after extensive deliberation,[A][N]
the High Dalstian Council has agreed to[N]
initiate the restoration of Aercolyn,[A][N]
provided that, and I quote,[A][N]
[OpenQuote]the state's heir sufficiently proves her[N]
absolute loyalty to the Dalstian Alliance.[CloseQuote][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]What exactly does absolute[N]
loyalty entail?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hardly anything to worry about, Lady.[A][N]
You are simply to travel to the[N]
Dalst-Mevion border.[A][N]
There have been rumors of Mevionese[N]
forces assailing settlements.[A][N]
Of course, you would have to do more[N]
than this to prove your loyalty,[A][N]
but this is[...] the beginning, shall we say.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
That[...] sounds fairly reasonable.[A][N]
Oh! By the way, on the way here,[N]
we ran into some Dalstian rebels-[A][N]
they were raving about something to[N]
do with Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, our diplomatic talks with Yg'stra.[A][N]
Do people not realize that diplomacy[N]
exists to AVOID bloodshed?[A][N]
Though[...] it is concerning that we've[N]
gone several weeks without response[...][A][N]
In any case, thank you for letting[A][N]
us know.[A] I'll send word to the[N]
council.[A] I believe it's now time[N]
you set off.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Sir Elcorian![N]
I won't let you down.[A][X]

##Ch1_Opening_2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadKenneth]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well[...] Here we are.[N]
Nothing too out of the ordinary.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Stay alert. I feel as if that's[N]
about to change.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
If I'm not wrong[...] I think I[N]
see some Mevionese insignia[...][A][N]
They appear to be approaching[N]
the nearby villages.[A][N]
They don't seem as if they're planning on[N]
outright pillaging,[A] but this surely[N]
can't be good.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, this appears to be what[N]
Sir Elcorian described.[A][N]
I believe it's up to us[N]
to drive them away![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Oy! What're you lot doin'?[A][N]
If you wanna keep yer heads,[N]
start runnin' now![A][N]
[...][A][N]
Well, you've made yer choice![A][N]
Nobility is on the menu[N]
tonight, fellas![A][N]
[OpenRight]
Looks like we don't have a choice here.[N]
We should prepare for battle.[A][N]
If we hold out long enough,[N]
they'll give up. Hopefully.[A][N][X]

Well[...] Here we are.[N]
Nothing too out of the ordinary.[A][N]

Stay alert. I feel as if that's[N]
about to change.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
[...]What's that off in[N]
the distance?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If I remember correctly[...][N]
that's the Mevionese coat of arms.[A][N]
Those men appear to have their[N]
eyes set on these villages.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, this appears to be what[N]
Sir Elcorian described.[A][N]
I believe it's up to us[N]
to drive them away![A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Oy! What're you lot doin'?[A][N]

I believe that does it.[N]
Good work, everyone![A][N]
[OpenRight]Ha! We really showed them![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]It was merely our duty.[N]
Casting out rubbish.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Oh, don't be a stick in the mud.[N]
This is worth celebrating![A][N]
How about you guys stay at my[N]
village for the night?[A][N]
I'm sure the others wouldn't mind,[N]
given you drove those dastards off.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]That sounds quite lovely.[A][N]
Tomorrow, I ought to return to the capital,[N]
and deliver news of our triumph![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][...][A][N]
[OpenLeft]What troubles you, Arin?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Nothing[...] important.[A][N]
[OpenRight]You sure? [...]Well, then.[N]
Off we go! We've lots to catch up on![A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][...]I'll have you know,[N]
that metaphor is an affront to sticks-[A][N]
and they're gone. Shame.[A][X]

##Ch1_Ending_Dead_Kenneth
[OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][OpenLeft][LoadBlair]
I believe that does it.[N]
Good work, everyone.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha! We really showed them![A][N]
[OpenLeft][...]If only he were here.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Who, Kenneth? Sure, it's[N]
a shame he's dead,[A] but at least[N]
you still have us![A][N]
[OpenLeft]I suppose[...] you're right.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Look, we did something right today.[N]
For that, we deserve to celebrate.[A][N]
How about you two stay the night here?[N]
Have a lovely feast.[A][N]
Something like that.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]That sounds nice.[A][N]
Tomorrow, I ought to head back[N]
to the capital to report the news.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][...][A][N]
[OpenLeft]What troubles you, Arin?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Nothing[...] important.[A][N]
[OpenRight]You sure? [...]Well, then.[N]
Off we go! We've lots to catch up on![A][X]

##Ch1_Ending_Dead_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenRight][LoadKenneth][OpenFarRight][LoadArin]
That's that. Shall we[N]
depart for Arbordia?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...][A][N]
[OpenRight]Is thia about Natasia?[A][N]
Look. What happened to her is unfortunate,[N]
but it's a waste to blame yourself.[A][N]
[CloseEyes][...]It's not easy for any of us.[N]
Yet, we must carry on.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]I'm sorry.[N]
You're right.[A][X]

##Ch1_Ending_Dead_Kenneth_and_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
It is done. Shall we depart for Arbordia?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]Why[...] Why does this keep happening?[N]
What[...] have I done wrong?[A][N]
Please[...] Tell me![N]
TELL ME WHY![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][...]We must keep going.[A][X]

##Blair_Recruits_Natasia
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia]
Blair, is that you?[N]
It's been so long![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Natasia? I almost forgot you[N]
lived around here![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha, yeah. Real scenic place.[N]
What brings you here, anyway?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]It's a bit of a long story.[A][N]
All I can say is we're fighting[N]
off some Mevionese.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]So you are[...][N]
Mind if I join ya?[A][N]
I wouldn't mind the chance to[N]
show these jerks some real strength![A][X]

##Arin_Recruits_Natasia
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia]
Good to see you, Arin.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I thought this place was familiar.[N]
How've you been, Natasia?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Fine, fine. Fairly uneventful.[N]
Just the way it goes.[A][N]
What's brought you here, anyway?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm with Blair on[...][N]
official business, I guess.[A][N]
Something about the Mevionese.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Time with Blair AND[N]
beating up these dastards?[A][N]
Sounds like my dream! Mind if[N]
I come with you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I see no reason to object.[N]
Just stay safe, please.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Trust me, Arin. I'm a real[N]
force to be reckoned with![A][X]

##Natasia_Verbally_Abuses_Kenneth_Then_Joins_The_Party
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia]
[...]Hello, Kenneth.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Hello, Natasia.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][...]Why did you come here?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Couldn't you sound a little[N]
happier to see me?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let me think about that[...][N]
[...]No.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Harsh.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, I'm not the snooty noble who[N]
stood me up eleven and a half times![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]I'm with Blair.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? You should've said so,[N]
you dummy![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I take it you'll be[N]
joining us?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, why not.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

##C1EVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
The Mevionese[...] They've been[N]
staking us out for days, now![A][N]
Nobody knows when they'll strike[...][A][N]
That's scarier than them just[N]
killing us all now, you know![A][N]
You're here to help, right?[N]
Right?[A] Here, take this book.[A][N]
It's filled with the best ways to[N]
gut a man- that'll help ya![A][X]

##C1Warning
[OpenMidRight][LoadMarque]
Hmph. Dalstians.[N]
What're they doing in our business?[A][N]
No matter. The reinforcements[N]
will get them.[A][N]
[...]As long as I'm alive to pay[N]
them, of course.[A][N][CloseEyes]
([...]If I die here, they're all running[N]
for the hills. Cowards, I say.)[A][N][OpenEyes]
Remember, men! We're after them,[N]
not any buildings they cower behind![A][X]

##Ch1_NatasiaScene
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia]
What's that commotion out there?[N]
I should probably check it out[...][A][N]
Though, there ARE lots of people[N]
nearby[...][A] Probably can't take[N]
them all out on my own.[A][N]
[...]You know what? Screw it![N]
I can take on all you chumps![A][N]
None of you will stand in my way![A][N]
Hear that, world? Natasia's got an[N]
axe with your name on it![A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Natasia? What're you doing here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't you remember- I live[N]
in that nearby village?[A][N]
I heard you fighting out here,[N]
and then I thought I saw a glimpse of you.[A][N]
Guess my eyes haven't failed me yet.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I see[...] What will[N]
you do now?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well now, I can't just leave you[N]
alone to storm into battle.[A][N]
Mind if I come with you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I mean[...] I don't want to put[N]
you in harm's way[...][A][N]
But at the same time[...][N]
We could use your strength[...][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Say no more! My mind[N]
is made up.[A][N]
We're getting the old academy[N]
gang back together![A][X]

##C1MarqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarque]
Hmph. This is none of your[N]

Leave now, and maybe[N]
