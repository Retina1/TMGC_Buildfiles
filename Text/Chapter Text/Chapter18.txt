##Ch18_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
If I'm reading this map correctly,[N]
we should be nearing northern Holanis.[A][N]
From there, we'll be a stone's[N]
throw from the Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I must say, it's getting[N]
rather dark and dreary.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say.[N]
I've been thinking.[A][N]
Lately, I mean.[A][N]
Am I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worthy?[Event][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worthy? Of what?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, all of this.[N]
Leading us into war.[A][N]
Having a crown on my head.[N]
Everything I've recently gained.[A][N]
When all I've done my whole life is[N]
while away at the edge of the world.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Am I to believe that I'm the future[N]
of Elba Cor,[A] just because I was[N]
lucky enough to be born that future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't think I can give[N]
you a satisfying answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
It's alright. I know it's a lot.[N]
I just can't shake it from my mind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
In any case, you've been invaluable.[A][N]
Ever since you joined our forces,[N]
it's like a weight has been lifted.[A][N][CloseEyes]
The war with Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It constantly felt[N]
like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was drowning.[A][N]
Like the world was closing in on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Good people fell on my watch.[A][N]
And I felt I had to burden myself[N]
with it all. For the army's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Apologies for pouring that out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. It does us well[N]
to speak our minds.[A][N][Event][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBaddie1]
How touchin'. It'll also do ye[N]
well ta die, ye' rats![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
Fellas! It's them nobles who took[N]
down the Brothers Ed![A][N]
Well, I'll have ye know,[N]
we've got a policy here:[A][N]
No baddies go unavenged.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Get 'em, boys![N]
Drown these dastards in darkness![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke]
Darkness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If that's their game,[N]
I think I've a plan.[A][N]
I see one torch nearby, and I have[N]
to imagine there's more.[A][N]
Set them ablaze, and their ambush[N]
loses its teeth.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Good thinking, Zeke.[A] Everyone! It's[N]
time to bring light to the darkness![A][X]

##_Ch18SysText
To complete this map,[N]
light every torch.[A][N]
They must all bit lit at once-[N]
don't bother dousing them.[A][N]
Once they're all lit, the map will end[N]
at the start of the next enemy phase.[A][X]
