[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think. It's been such[N]
a tiring road.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't disagree there. But it's[N]
as I've said before.[A][N]
I shall stand by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Couldn't you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be more[N]
than that?[A][N]
Your skills are unparalleled.[N]
Surely[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I leave you to seek glory?[N]
I'm content to be by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I know. I'm just afraid[N]
that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this'll never end.[A][N]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm leading all of us[N]
into some kind of oblivion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're doing as well as you can.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We trust you.[A][N]
That's why we're still here.[A][N]
You don't try to act as some flawless[N]
leader[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Someone incomparable.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you. And that earnestness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It comforts us all.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] struggled, sometimes, to[N]
affirm my purpose.[A][N]
But you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a great purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] needed that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Let's not dawdle.[N]
We've ruins to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ToggleSmile]
Well, hopefully not ruin.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought that was funny.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never change, please.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe you're not wrong, mister.[N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a good guy.[A][N]
Despite your dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm truly humbled.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do you use darkness?[N]
We're a force of good![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There's more subtlety to magic[N]
than just good or evil.[A][N]
That's why many, including I,[N]
prefer to call it elder magic.[A][N]
It's quite unfair to write it off[N]
as the product of madmen,[A][N]
when it is in fact a rich field[N]
about the essence of the world.[A][N]
Any magic can produce calamity if[N]
left unchecked.[A][N]
In fact, any THING can in general,[N]
if these ruins are any indication.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As you said, though. We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
the good guys.[A][N]
Nothing'll happen under our watch.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right, mister.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's fine. Now, then. Let's[N]
show them what we can do.[A][X]
