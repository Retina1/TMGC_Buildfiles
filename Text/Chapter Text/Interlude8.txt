##I8SendOff
Send this unit to scout?[N]
[No][X]
##I8SysText
Decide on exactly three units[N]
to send ahead to scout.[A][N]
Viridian and Chartreuse[N]
cannot be among them.[A][N]
These units will not see Viridian[N]
again for a long time,[A] so make[N]
your decision carefully.[A][X]

##I8Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]I've formulated a plan.[A][N]
Three of us shall move ahead[N]
to scout,[A] while the remaining[N]
ten shall take this position.[A][N]
The scout team will report to us[N]
at this marked location,[A][N]
once the lady's party has[N]
reached our meetup spot.[A][N]
Does this seem reasonable?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Viridian?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Right! It's all[...] alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you sure? You seem like you've[N]
been out of it for a few days.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's fine. Just[...] stressed from[N]
the impending date.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What if[...] this is all a mistake?[N]
I[...] saw myself in a dream.[A][N]
Something within me said we'd[N]
all[...] die here.[A][N]
That nagging fear sometimes[N]
strikes, but this time[...][A][N]
It's[...] genuine.[A][N]
[...]We know nothing of Holanis.[N]
Nothing of their power.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] see. Are[...] you sure[N]
you want to do this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We[...] have to. Not just because[N]
of this mystery,[A] but because[N]
we swore to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It wouldn't be right to not[N]
tell the others of my fears.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadRift]
You hardly need to tell[N]
us a thing, boss.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
We'll stick by you until the end.[N]
Wouldn't be right for us to run.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadManfred]
Indeed. We speak for everyone[N]
outside of this tent.[A][N]
We know this is a dangerous[N]
job, but we're all ready for it.[A][N]
We knew what this life would[N]
bring,[A] and are willing to risk[N]
it to stand together.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] appreciate it, all.[N]
This still feels very wrong[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
But we must walk our chosen paths.[A][N]
You said three, correct?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That I did. Once you've made[N]
your choice,[A] we'll begin[N]
our final preparations.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[...]So this is it.[A][N]
Our scouts may face risk beyond[N]
comprehension.[A] Three soldiers[N]
alone would stand no chance.[A][N]
Even so[...] Going without a forward squad[N]
could guarantee all of our deaths.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Who lives? Who dies?[N]
It's all[...] in my hands.[A][X]

##I8Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
This[...] is it.[N]
The scouts[...] have left.[A][N]
[...]Everyone. It's time[N]
to set our position.[A][N]
These coming days will decide[N]
our fate.[A] Even so, we will[N]
never back down.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Onwards![A][X]

##I8ChartreuseTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadChartreuse]
I know this has been a long[N]
and exhausting journey.[A][N]
But[...] We're behind you, Viridian.[A][N]
I'm behind you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] Thank you. But[...][N]
Do you deserve this?[A][N]
Risking your life for us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not about deserving. It's about[N]
me choosing to fight with you.[A][N]
You've[...] saved me. It'd be[N]
wrong to not return the favor.[A][N]
No matter what, I'll stay at[N]
your side.[A] [...]I'm sure you've[N]
heard that a lot, lately.[A][N]
But you deserve to hear it.[A][X]

meet again.[A][N]
I'd better[...] be off.[N]
To prepare.[A][X]
##SendFreddricNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You've still time to decide.[N]
I know[...] this isn't easy.[A][N]
But whatever you decide,[N]
we're here to the end.[A][X]
##I8FreddricTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]I know the mood's harsh here,[N]
but[...][A] I just wanted to thank[N]
you. For everything.[A][N]
While we still have the chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Thank you, Freddric.[A][N]
But[...] There's no reason to[N]
act like this'll be the end.[A][N]
It[...] can't be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're right.[A][X]

##SendDean
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadDean]

[...]Thanks fer everythin'.[A][X]
##SendDeanNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadDean][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It'll be alright. You'll[N]

##I8DeanTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadDean]
I know my family knows I[N]
might not come back[...][A][N]
It's[...] sad, but[...] they're[N]
prepared for that.[A][N]
[...]Don't worry. I won't leave ya'.[N]
I don't fight just for myself.[A][N]
Yer' all like a second family.[N]
I'll never give up on you.[A][X]

##SendElizaNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]

You[...] don't need to[...][N]
feel bad about this.[A][N]
[...]It's how[...] it has to be.[A][X]
##I8ElizaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
[...]I've[...] been useful, right?[A][N]
That's[...] all I've wanted.[N]
To help others.[A][N]
That's all both of us have ever wanted.[A][N]
Spreading something happy throughout[N]
this disheartening world.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for this chance.[A][X]

##SendRift

[...]Good luck, Rift.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't need luck. I'll[...][N]
make you proud, boss.[A][N]
[...]It's been a good run.[A][X]
##SendRiftNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]

I get it. You might want me[N]
at your side.[A][N]
[...]Wherever you send me,[N]
I'll do what I always do.[A][X]
##I8RiftTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
This has been[...] a nice life,[N]
compared to the arena.[A][N]
I'm still fighting to live[...][N]
But I'm doing good things.[A][N]
Thank you for giving me this[N]
chance. You all are[...] quite alright.[A][X]

##SendEstelle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
If this is the final act,[N]
I shall face it with head high.[A][X]
##SendEstelleYes
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sorry for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It will be the performance of[N]
a lifetime.[A] And perhaps I shall[N]
surpass our expectations.[A][N]
[...]Let the tale of Estelle echo[N]
through history's pages.[A][X]
##SendEstelleNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Truly, this is a struggle[N]
beyond comprehension.[A][N]
I only wish I could ease[N]
the burden of your choice.[A][X]
##I8EstelleTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
Mine eyes have seen many a[N]
sight beyond compare.[A][N]
If[...] we make it out, I can[N]
breathe new life into the stage.[A][N]

I'm proud to be pushing the[N]
boundaries of acting this way.[A][N]

be worth it in the end.[A][X]

I helped people.[A][N]
I gave them something to[N]
rely on.[A] Something to[N]

uncover these secrets.[A][X]

##SendWilhelmYes
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]At least you're honest about it.[A][N]
Elba Cor would try to sugarcoat[N]
a deathmarch like this.[A][N]
[...]It's been a pleasure.[A][X]
##SendWilhelmNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I need to think.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

##I8WilhelmTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm]
It's been a weird life, lately.[A][N]
From gambler, to soldier, to mercenary[...][N]
You know what's weirder?[A][N]
I know our client. She was in[N]
Elba Cor when it was invaded.[A][N]
Small world, I guess. She's[N]
probably real important.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you need to rethink this,[N]
take all the time you need.[A][N]
Just know that while you may feel[N]
there is no right choice[...][A][N]
There is also no wrong choice.[A][X]
##I8ArgentTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent]
It's remarkable, how beautiful this[N]
once-barren land has become.[A][N]
I know little of Holanis's past,[N]
but I am certain it has a future.[A][N]
In the end, that's what we fight[N]
for, is it not?[A] The futures[N]
of all of our lands?[A][N]
[...]Of course, today is also[N]
of grave importance.[A][X]
