[OpenMidLeft][LoadJohan][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sir Desmond and I shall be back[N]
before sundown![A] Mark my words-[N]
our duel shall be-[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's great, Stefan.[N]
But you know I'll win anyway.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha! We'll see.[N]
Farewell.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Now then. Where was I?[N]
Upkeep it is, I suppose.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And that's that. What else[N]
to attend to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1]Johan! We have a problem![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the issue?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Our scouts reported an unconfirmed army[N]
headed this way.[A] Currently, we have[N]
reason to believe it's the Yg'strans![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a surprise.[A][N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Rally whatever troops we have here[N]
to mount a defensive position.[A][N]
Desmond and Stefan left not too long ago.[N]
If they return, we'll be greatly advantaged.[A][N]
What else[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Have our mages launch the[N]
emergency signal.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'll pray the capital[N]
takes notice. That's our only hope.[A][X]

##Ch2_Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadKenneth][OpenFarRight][LoadNatasia][OpenLeft]
Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're almost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How are there so many[N]
of them already?[A][N]
[OpenRight]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that's their move.[N]
Target the isolated state.[A][N]
They probably believed Aercolyn to be[N]
less defended as a Dalstian entrypoint.[A][N]
The real question is why, and why now?[A][N]
As far as I knew, negotiations had been[N]
progressing smoothly.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Well, that doesn't mean anything now![N]
What matters is that we're under attack![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]This might sound mad, but I believe our best[N]
plan is to get on the offensive.[A][N]
The Yg'strans may very well underestimate us,[N]
and it'll get harder the longer we wait.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Well, you didn't lie.[N]
That's beyond mad.[A][N]
This is a real army we're dealing with![A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We do have an element of surprise[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And more importantly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I feel this sense[N]
of duty.[A] I can't leave the soldiers here[N]
waiting for a savior that will never come.[A][N]
We have to be their saviors.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Well said! I'm always down[N]
to crush some dastards.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]I believe we're in agreement here.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. I've come this far.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]Thank you, my friends.[N]
I know we'll win.[A][X]

##Ch2_Opening_Dead_Kenneth_and_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're here.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]What's our move? There's quite a[N]
large contigent already here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We have to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] charge now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
We can't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] lose anyone else[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][X]

##Ch2_Opening_Dead_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft]
Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're almost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How are there so many[N]
of them already?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that's their move.[N]
Target the isolated state.[A][N]
They probably believed Aercolyn to be[N]
less defended as a Dalstian entrypoint.[A][N]
The real question is why, and why now?[A][N]
As far as I knew, negotiations had been[N]
progressing smoothly.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Whatever the case, we're under attack now.[N]
What's our strategy?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Maybe we should take an[N]
offensive stance.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Intersting idea[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
The Yg'strans may underestimate us.[A][N]
Plus, things'll only get worse the longer[N]
we delay.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite the plan.[A][N]
You do know we're fighting an[N]
actual army, right?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We do have an element of surprise[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And more importantly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I feel this sense[N]
of duty.[A] I can't leave the soldiers here[N]
waiting for a savior that will never come.[A][N]
We have to be their saviors.[A][N]
[OpenRight]I believe it's settled, then.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Very well.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, my friends.[A][N]
I know we'll win.[A][X]

##Ch2_Opening_Dead_Kenneth
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadNatasia][OpenMidLeft]
Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're almost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How are there so many[N]
of them already?[A][N]
[OpenRight]If we assume their goal is invading Dalst[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
perhaps Aercolyn is an ideal starting point.[A][N]
But that flies counter to the negotiations[N]
we've heard about[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarRight]Well, that doesn't mean anything now![N]
What matters is that we're under attack![A][N]
[OpenLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Maybe we should take an[N]

The Yg'strans may underestimate us.[A][N]
Plus, things'll only get worse the longer[N]
we delay.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]That almost sounds crazy enough to work.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]We've got the element of surprise.[A][N]
And more importantly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I feel this sense[N]
of duty.[A] I can't leave the soldiers here[N]
waiting for a savior that will never come.[A][N]
We have to be their saviors.[A][N]
[OpenRight]We're all in agreement, then.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Hell yeah! Let's give these[N]
chumps what they deserve![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, my friends.[A][N]
I know we'll win.[A][X]

##Ch2_Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenLeft]
We've retaken the barracks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Good work, everyone.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Why would they go through all this effort,[N]
only to give them up so easily?[A][N]
You'd think any rational foe would fight[N]
tooth and nail for a location like this.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]It's a mystery, for sure.[N]
But we should still cele-[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadDesmond][OpenFarRight][LoadStefan]
L-lady Blair[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] W-we've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
E-emergency[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
[OpenRight]Deep breaths, Stefan.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]What's the matter?[N]
Why's he in a panic?[A][N]
Weren't you two searching[N]
for survivors?[A][N]
[OpenRight]Well, that's the problem.[N]
There are none.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]The Yg'strans took everyone here prisoner[N]
and executed them that quickly?[A][N]
[OpenRight]You misunderstand me.[N]
There are NONE.[A][N]
No people, no bodies, nothing.[N]
It's as if everyone here vanished.[A][N]
Stefan, here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Naturally, he isn't[N]
taking it the best.[A][N]
Not to say I'm not concerned[N]
and baffled myself.[A][N]
If the Yg'strans can make an army vanish,[N]
who knows what else they can do?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
We have to do something![A][N]
[OpenRight]I agree, but we mustn't[N]
make rash decisions.[A][N]
Perhaps send word of this to[N]
Arbordia,[A] and see if the rest[N]
of Dalst will send assistance.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry. This won't[N]
go unanswered.[A][X]

##Ch2_Ending_Dead_Stefan_and_Desmond
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do we continue to suffer[N]
like this?[A] What meaning does[N]
it hold?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]After everything that happened today,[N]
I sincerely wish I didn't have to say this,[A][N]
but the barracks are comepletely empty.[A][N]
No signs of life, and no signs of death.[N]
It's as if nobody was ever here.[A][N]
It's reasonable to believe that[N]
Yg'stra is the cause of this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They will suffer for[N]
what they've done.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We should send word to Dalst.[N]
Let them know of what happened.[A][N][OpenEyes]
For now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Please, get some rest.[A][X]

##Ch2_Ending_Dead_Desmond
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenRight][LoadStefan][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Commander[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] WHY!?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[N]
This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] my[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] fault[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadArin]I'm sorry to say this,[N]
but the barracks are completely empty.[A][N]
No signs of life, and no signs of death.[N]
As if nobody was ever here.[A][N]
It's reasonable to assume Yg'stra[N]
is somehow behind this.[A][N]
Where do we go from here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We should[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] retaliate.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It'd be wise to request backup[N]
from Dalst, though.[A][N]
They must[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] know of this.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Understandable.[A][N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] get some rest. Both of you.[N]
Today's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] trying, to say the least.[A][X]

##Ch2_Ending_Dead_Stefan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
We've retaken the barracks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]I'm still wondering why it was that[N]
easy to shoo them off[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But all's well, I suppose.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadDesmond]
I'm afraid that's not exactly the case.[N]
I searched for survivors, and, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Must more people die?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Not quite. There was nobody alive,[N]
and nobody dead.[A] No corpses, no blood.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you're saying the Yg'strans made[N]
our entire army vanish?[A][N]
What kind of power do they hold?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]I've no idea, unfortunately.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where do we go from here, Blair?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We have to do something.[N]
This can't go unanswered.[A][N]
It'd probably be best to petition[N]
Dalst for assistance.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Very well. I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] see what's[N]
left here.[A][CloseEyes][N]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry, everyone.[N]
I've failed you all.)[A][X]

##Ch2_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, what are your thoughts?[N]
What may you be able to provide us?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Yg'stra striking now is very[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unusual.[A][N]
I'll see what I can scrounge together.[A][N]
Unfortunately, on such short notice,[N]
I cannot make any promises.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]At the very least, take this.[N]
Call it a personal favor.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's quite a sum of gold to just carry[N]
around like that! Are you sure?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's money that'll come out of Dalst[N]
one way or another.[A] May as well make[N]
things easier now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, sir![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Certainly. Now, if you'll excuse me,[N]
I have business to attend to.[A][X]

##C2StefanDesmond
[OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Sir Desmond! There they are![A][N]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadDesmond][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Good[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Good eye[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Stefan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Are you alright, sir?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Never[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] better[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] out of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] breath[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You did a swell job keeping up[N]
with my horse, at least.[A][N]
Why didn't you bring yours[N]
for training, anyway?[A][A]
[OpenMidLeft]A true knight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
must never get rusty.[A][N]
I felt it best to practice dismounted[N]
manuevers every once in a while.[A][N]
Of course, today just had to be[N]
the day Yg'stra made their move.[A][N]
In any case, I'm alright to stay[N]
on foot.[A] You're young and inexperienced.[N]
You need every advantage you can get.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm honored, sir! But I'll also[N]
prove you wrong-[A] I may be young,[N]
but I can fight with the best of them![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's see how you handle this, then.[A][N]
The Yg'strans are calling our name, and I[N]
don't intend to leave them unanswered.[A][X]

##C2Spooky
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBaddie3][OpenMidRight][LoadBrentson]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do you want?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know what we desire.[N]
Are the barracks secured?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]For now. The lordling's fighting[N]
tooth and nail to reverse that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose that will have to do.[A][N]
Gentlemen! Initiate the plan![N]
Capture all who're inside. Alive.[A][X]

##C2Spooky2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
You're coming with us,[N]
Aercolynese scum![A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadSoldier1][OpenFarRight][LoadJohan]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How did they[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] shouldn't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenRight]Sir Johan! We shall prevail![A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's hope you're right.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]They said they want you alive[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I can still rough you up![A][N]
Face it, you're no match for our might.[N]
Especially with this power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wha-[A][X]

##C2BrentsonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
Apologies, but these are[N]
our barracks now.[A][N]
You think you can take them?[N]
Good luck, friend.[A][X]

##C2BrentsonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrentson]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Impressive[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] isn't the end[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's more of us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
where that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] came from[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C2VillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Those filthy Yg'strans[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Their armor's hard as steel![A][N]
I mean, it's made of steel, so[N]
I guess that's to be expected[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
WHATEVER! Look, I used to be a carpenter.[A][N]
This old hammer of mine should crack[N]
those cans right open.[A][X]

##C2JohanT2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier1][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft]
Sir Johan! How shall we proceed?[N]
The enemy has us cornered.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I think I hear some activity outside.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It sounds like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Blair.[A][N]
Our call has been answered.[N]
All we must do now is survive.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. It'll be fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Thank you for everything, sir.[A][X]

##C2BlairStefanTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Milady! Have you come to[N]
assist us?[A][N]
I am Stefan, at your service.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think I've seen you around before.[N]
Glad to see you're safe.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Any idea what's happening?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately, I've not a clue.[A][N]
Sir Desmond and I were out training,[N]
and when we returned, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
As you can tell, Yg'stra's attacking.[N]
But I'm sure we'll prevail![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure you're right, Stefan.[N]
We're relying on you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And I won't let you down.[A][X]

##C2BlairDesmondTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond][OpenMidLeft]
Desmond! It's good to see you're alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Same to you, milady. Unfortunately,[N]
[OpenQuote]alright[CloseQuote] doesn't mean much now.[A][N]
Yg'stra's here. Obviously. And my men[N]
are backed up to a corner in there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then it's up to us to save them![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course, milady. On your orders.[A][X]

##C2StefanJohanTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
You're a dirty cheater, you know?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hey! I shower every day![N]
I'm a clean cheater![A][X]
