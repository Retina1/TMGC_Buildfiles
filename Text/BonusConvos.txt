##BonusBobby
[OpenMidRight][LoadBobby]
Hi! I'm BobbyAsaka, and frankly I'm[N]
flattered that Retina invited me to say[A][N]
my piece here, given that the significant[N]
majority of my contributions to TMGC[A][N]
were just bugging him to write more.[A][N]
A lot of what I did was stuff like[N]
"hey, you should add 10 boss quotes here"[A][N]
or "hey, can you rewrite this, it feels off".[A][N]
I'd say my most impactful contributions[N]
were probably my suggestions with Zeke,[A][N]
specifically making his choices lead to[N]
the fate of the Viridian Mercenaries.[A][N]
(Though one of the postgame maps is[N]
also apparently my fault, I hear.)[A][CloseSpeechSlow][N]
So I often say that hacks tend to be[N]
specialized in where they excel most,[A][N]
and I'd likely say TMGC's most[N]
distinct draw is the way it leans into[A][N]
a classic FE experience:[A][N]
finding some scrimblo in the cast[N]
and getting really attached to them.[A][N]
This is pretty ubiquitous in most FEs,[N]
but I think TMGC's systems make it[A][N]
especially conducive to this effect.[A][N]
With so many units in the game, and[N]
so much story content for all of them,[A][N]
there's bound to be someone in the[N]
cast whose vibes mesh well with you.[A][N]
And the hack's sandboxy feel and[N]
broad toolkit leverage that further[A][N]
by letting you turn anyone not named[N]
Ian into a beast if you really try.[A][N]
Personally, Kenneth is probably my[N]
favorite character in the game, but[A][N]
I'm also fond of Desmond, Horatio, Sam,[N]
Johan, and Ptolemy (among others).[A][N]
I can't recommend using them enough,[A][N]
and I think they definitely enrich the[N]
story experience when deployed.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
On another note, I think fan projects[N]
like these can often end up being the[A][N]
creators' darlings, so to speak.[A][N]
A lot of these fan works are fueled[N]
off raw passion above all,[A][N]
and I think that often leads to them[N]
having uniquely special vibes.[A][N]
So I find it really rewarding to[N]
approach them with the same weight[A][N]
as I would with any professionally[N]
published work of fiction--[A][N]
and I'd encourage you to do the same,[N]
whether with TMGC or other hacks.[A][N]
Sure, you can argue that fan works[N]
are flawed or unpolished and so on,[A][N]
but more official titles fall under that[N]
umbrella all the time anyways, too.[A][N]
And speaking personally as a creator,[N]
it's truly fulfilling seeing someone engage[A][N]
with the story and world you've created[N]
with a similar amount of care and love[A][N]
as you had when you made it yourself.[A][N]
That's what I try to do with every[N]
hack I pick up,[A][N]
and hell, it got me into this dev room.[A][N]
And if it got me here, it'll surely bring[N]
you to places you wouldn't expect, too.[A][X]

##EBonusGlod
Good as Gold[X]

##BonusGlod
[OpenMidRight][LoadGlod]
Um. Hi, hello. It's Goldblitzx, mugger[N]
and idea person for this hackrom![A][N]
I don't really know what to say here,[N]
I guess thanks for playing this hack???[A][N]
It's been a two year long journey for me[N]
in which I literally changed gender,[A][N]
so[...] Very eventful.[A][N]
I made my first splice for this[N]
hack around May 2022.[A] It was the[N]
first splice I had made in about a year,[A][N]
and the result was a monstrosity of[N]
a portrait for Jeff.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][Loadsinner]
[...]Fr[...]ee[...] me[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Needless to say, I've improved[...][N]
a lot in this time.[A][N]
I also grew up a lot with TMGC.[A][N]
I was a highschooler when the hack[N]
started development,[A] and as of[N]
writing this, I'm a sophomore in college.[A][N]
If you're wondering who my favorite unit is,[N]
by the way, it's Damien. He's so cool.[A][N]
I think I influenced character design[N]
for the hack in general, too.[A][N]
Before I had got my hands on the hack,[N]
most Opistians were all pasty white,[A][N]
and there wasn't a lot of color scheme[N]
cohesion among people from similar regions.[A][N]
I think literally every trans character[N]
is also my fault???[A][N]
I know I 100% suggested Viridian being[N]
nonbinary,[A] and definitely[N]
Hollandaise and Apollo being trans.[A][N]
So I guess I WOKEwashed this great[N]
American hackrom.[A][N]
[...]This is all being written down in a[N]
notes doc as it comes to me, by the way.[A][N]
Call me Mary Shelley for that.[A][N]
Uh[...] This mug I'm using probably looks[N]
similar to one you saw in the lategame.[A][N]
Wink. Wink.[A][N]
If you want to see more from[N]
the TMGC world,[A][N]
check out my hackrom[N]
Searching For Light.[A][N]
Also play Embers Entwined,[N]
that's another cool one.[A][N]
The community that this hackrom has[N]
built is pretty cool.[A][N]
Very few negative individuals[N]
and stuff. Pretty neat.[A][N]
I'm running out of things to bullshit[...][A][N]
Uh, shoutouts to Knight_Moris and hit[N]
LTCer Familyplayer I guess.[A][N]
If you like jazz, listen to Maynard[N]
Fergusen Cruisin' For a Bluesin'.[A][N]
It goes hard AF.[A][N]
[...][...][...][A][N]
[...][...][...][A][N]
If you have somebody you like,[N]
politely ask to make out sloppy style.[A][X]

##EBonus1
Just For You[X]

##BonusConvo1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Welcome to the bonus conversations![A][N]
I'm Retina, the guy who made the[N]
hack you're playing right now.[A][N]
[...]Or that you're watching an LP[N]
of right now.[A][N]
Anyway, this section of the event[N]
viewer is dedicated to odds and ends.[A][N]
Whether that be development trivia,[N]
highly-staged interviews,[A][N]
or just some old-fashioned shitposts.[A][N]
[...]Don't worry. Lazarus saying fuck[N]
already set the swear standard.[A][N]
Anyway, thanks for checking this out,[N]
and I'll see you in a future conversation.[A][N]
As I always say, goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus2
The Original Sin[X]

##BonusConvo2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The concepts in this hack go back[N]
to my high school days.[A][N]
Before I even knew what a builder was,[N]
I drafted up ideas[...] that sucked.[A][N]
Younger me thought an 80 chapter campaign[N]
with 7 acts was an acceptable length.[A][N]
[...]49 chapters is very[N]
reasonable, I swear.[A][N]
Names for a lot of characters originated[N]
either in .txt files,[A] or in a list that[N]
I typed on a graphing calculator.[A][N]
I don't get it either.[A][N]
Fast forward a few years, and as I[N]
was developing Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
these all re-emerged in my head,[N]
and were eventually placed in a ROM.[A][N]
Nothing ever happened to said ROM,[N]
since I quickly moved to buildfiles.[A][N]
Some older concepts included Hyperius[N]
and Damien as possible lords,[A][N]
Viridian and Blair's parties coming[N]
to blows,[A] and Elcorian having had[N]
a role in Mevion's revolution.[A][N]
[...]The old drafts were weird.[A][N]
Viridian's party didn't even exist in[N]
the buildfiles for quite some time.[A][N]
And some characters, like Yuyu, were[N]
spur of the moment additions,[A][N]
unlike the very carefully planned[N]
out original cast.[A][N]
If you open up the ROM in Builder,[A][N]
every unit after Elcorian's slot was[N]
conceived after development began,[A][N]
while everyone before him was planned[N]
from the very beginning.[A][N]
One last tidbit for now: instead of[N]
Kenneth and Natasia,[A] there was[N]
originally Vincent and Kenny.[A][N]
Yes, Vincent was the dark mage and[N]
Kenny was the fighter.[A][N]
Anyways, that's all for now.[N]
Thank you, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus3
Gameplay Inspirations[X]

##BonusConvo3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
I joke about my first full hack,[N]
Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
being a bootleg Souls of the Forest,[N]
but honestly, that's a misnomer.[A][N]
Trying to quantify a hack as a[N]
[OpenQuote]blank-like[CloseQuote] is reductive.[A][N]
In any case, I was inspired by fast[N]
paced player phase design,[A][N]
and sought to further polish my[N]
style in TMGC.[A][N]
My philosophy on skills was inspired[N]
by Vision Quest,[A] though they're more[N]
impactful and common here.[A][N]
Hacks like Cerulean Coast and Eternal[N]
Winter also inspired how I use skills,[A][N]
in the sense that they made me realize[N]
how absolutely insane they could get.[A][N]
Really, if you want to make a hack,[A][N]
you shouldn't worry about being[N]
like anything.[A] Experiment a bit,[N]
and find what works best for you.[A][N]
Vanilla stats, inflation, deflation[...][N]
They're all valid ways to design.[A][N]
Anyhoot, that's enough for now.[N]
Godspeed, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus4
Aesthetics[X]

##BonusConvo4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Aesthetics are hard to talk about,[N]
especially since I'm no artist.[A][N]
All the mugs I've made for this have[N]
been replaced,[A] or at the very least[N]
heavily polished by others (thanks Gold).[A][N]
Still, I sometimes splice things,[N]
and that's a valuable experience.[A][N]
Don't get too hung up on your hack's[N]
visual identity at first.[A][N]
If it's something people enjoy,[N]
you're bound to eventually meet people[N]
willing to help polish its look.[A][N]
That being said, I've felt creating[N]
an identity to be extremely rewarding.[A][N]
The menus are obviously a major part[N]
of that, and unfortunately,[A][N]
for many people (myself included),[N]
making menus is mind-bending.[A][N]
Luckily, our community has many[N]
people willing to help with this.[A][N]
I don't want to come off sounding[N]
like some shill,[A] but the assets[N]
I've commissioned from Scraiza are,[A][N]
without hyperbole, absolutely[N]
incredible.[A][N]
[...]I feel I've lost my[N]
train of thought here.[A][N]
Are aesthetics important, or no?[A][N]
I'd say yes, but at the end of the[N]
day, gameplay is more important.[A][N]
Well, then. Until next time.[N]
[...]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart1
Prologue - Ch. 5[X]

##BonusConvoPart1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The start of a game can be one[N]
of the hardest things to design.[A][N]
At once you have to balance easing[N]
the player into a new world,[A][N]
introducing the context you need,[N]
and establishing WHAT your game is.[A][N]
All that considered, I think the[N]
earlygame's pretty alright.[A][N]
Some don't like earlygames with[N]
small casts, and that's alright.[A][N]
So I definitely get why some people[N]
don't like Prologue and Chapter 1,[A][N]
though for me, Chapter 1's a favorite.[A][N]
It's a challenging map that forces[N]
you to cleverly use a very small,[A][N]
very weak cast, and it forces you[N]
to prioritize what loot you want.[A][N]
[...]And then ArcherBias convinced me[N]
to make it better, so all's good.[A][N]
I don't have too much to say on 2 or 3,[A][N]
though one of my playtesters convinced[N]
me to add that Quixotic scroll.[A][N]
Chapter 4's the first map that really[N]
forces you to play somewhat fast,[A][N]
and I think I managed to get the[N]
pace feeling natural.[A][N]
Chapter 5's the first fog map.[A][N]
I actually like fog, so one of my[N]
goals was to make good fog maps.[A][N]
I know, real controversial.[N]
[OpenQuote]Make a good map.[CloseQuote][A][N]
I like little touches in 5, like the[N]
visible soldier with a killer lance,[A][N]
or the boss endangering the topmost[N]
torch on Lunatic,[A] and I think[N]
it shows that fog CAN work well.[A][N]
As for earlygame writing, it's[...][N]
alright.[A][N]
For all it's built up as, Mevion[N]
basically functions as earlygame bandits.[A][N]
Yg'stra doesn't get much yet, and[N]
Lazarus isn't particularly deep.[A][N]
But, it sets up an alright conflict,[N]
sets up Elba Cor's involvement,[A][N]
and spreads lore out in a manageable way.[A][N]
In general, I like Tellius's style of[N]
introducing countries not all at once,[A][N]
but rather as they become important.[A][N]
It feels more natural and breaks up[N]
an otherwise minutes long loredump.[A][N]
I also think the moment-to-moment[N]
character interactions are great,[A][N]
and that will hold true in general.[A][N]
I'm far better at dialogue than[N]
plotting, so[...] be warned, I guess?[A][N]
Thanks for reading,[N]
and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart2
Ch. 5x - Ch. 10[X]

##BonusConvoPart2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
So, interludes. Always fun to see[N]
people's reactions to them.[A][N]
Especially when they're along[N]
the lines of [OpenQuote]holy shit, i can walk![CloseQuote][A][N]
There's not a lot of traditional[N]
town maps in this hack,[A][N]
so being able to make maps that[N]
wouldn't work at ALL in real play - [A][N]
maps that were absolutely massive[N]
and a pain to navigate - [A][N]
was pretty fun.[A][N]
Plus, it's a good way to help[N]
ensure people don't forget to shop.[A][N]
Chapter 6 and 7 are two of my favorites,[N]
if only because of the music track.[A][N]
This part of the game until Chapter[N]
10's relatively relaxed,[A][N]
and there's not a huge amount in the[N]
way of new ideas introduced.[A][N]
Chapter 8 is admittedly peak filler,[A][N]
and its plot ideas should've gotten[N]
more focus than they did[...][A][N]
But[...] Uh[...][A][N]
[...]Anyway. Boat arc's cool too.[A][N]
Chapter 9 was the FEE3 showcase map[N]
in 2022, which is very funny.[A][N]
Boat map drawing people in.[A][N]
Chapter 9x was a fun twist on[N]
the established interlude formula,[A][N]
and getting more chances to write[N]
these characters is always fun.[A][N]
[...]And then you get to Chapter 10.[A][N]
Definitely a big spike in complexity,[N]
especially with the Jonas secrets.[A][N]
But I think it's a really memorable[N]
way to end this mini-arc,[A][N]
and it introduces peak fiction[N]
himself, Sveltzalus.[A][N]
What's not to love?[A][N]
[...]Anyway, that's all I have.[N]
Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart3
Ch. 11 - Ch. 14[X]

##BonusConvoPart3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Jumping straight into a desert map,[N]
right after boat arc.[A][N]
I was really checking off all the[N]
controversial map archetypes here.[A][N]
If you're paying attention, this is[N]
the real first time you fight Holanians.[A][N]
So that's kinda fun.[A][N]
This is also the first map where I decided[N]
to break my self-imposed cast size rule,[A][N]
by going back and adding Agnes.[A][N]
Not a ton else to say here.[A][N]
Chapter 12 used to drive story people[N]
mad by having units die when killed.[A][N]
Casual mode for this map was a fairly[N]
late in development addition.[A][N]
It's also when my FE12 influence[N]
comes out in full force,[A][N]
in the form of dragons.[A][N]
Then, after a quick interlude, we're[...][N]
already taking Yg'stra?[A][N]
[...]Yeah, the Yg'stran invasion[N]
could've used an extra map.[A][N]
It's fine as is, but a little[N]
bit anticlimactic.[A][N]
Incidentally, Chapter 13's vast size is[N]
part of why I added save points.[A][N]
It also has one of the first payoffs for[N]
a minor plot beat - Desmond's horse.[A][N]
Setup and payoff's something I enjoy,[N]
even if sometimes the setups are[...][A][N]
Well, too subtle.[A][N]
Chapter 14's the end of the arc.[A][N]
I went a little hard making sure[N]
you wouldn't softlock on Lazarus,[A][N]
but I think humiliating him also[N]
feels pretty good anyway.[A][N]
Briant[...] sure exists. Definitely more[N]
just a plot device.[A][N]
I don't think characters serving little[N]
purpose beyond that is necessarily BAD,[A][N]
but I admit he's a little nothing.[A][N]
[...]Also I swear your choices[N]
really matter.[A][N]
Speaking of choices, I'll choose to[N]
spare you of more. Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart4
Zeke Arc[X]

##BonusConvoPart4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
After getting comfortable, I like[N]
to shake things up a bit.[A][N]
So, here. Have a Thracia-like[N]
chain of escape maps.[A][N]
Zeke's relevance is[...] tenuous, but I[N]
liked the concept behind him.[A][N]
So, he became Lord 2.[A] Really old[N]
drafts had Hyperius as a lord,[A][N]
though he wasn't any nobility.[A][N]
Just an important guy.[A][N]
Old drafts also had Damien as important.[N]
Bit of a shame he's now just a guy.[A][N]
Chapter B was one of my favorite map[N]
concepts - [A]rivers and mountains together[N]
make for some fun terrain,[A][N]
and the gimmick's not something[N]
I've really seen before.[A][N]
Chapter Bx was the last chapter added[N]
to the outline,[A] mainly because someone[N]
suggested Zeke get room to breathe.[A][N]
Only took an afternoon to make, and I'm[N]
really happy to have it around.[A][N]
By the way, cool bug fact: technically[N]
you control Blair in that map.[A][N]
She's just reclassed to look like Zeke.[A][N]
Not a huge amount to say about the[N]
rest of the arc -[A] it's a simple and[N]
solid part of the game.[A][N]
Interlude Cx is when everything truly starts[N]
to come together,[A] especially with the[N]
existence of certain mercenaries[...][A][N]
But that's a story for another day.[N]
[...]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart5
Ch. 15 - Ch. 20[X]

##BonusConvoPart5
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The midgame, or, as I often call[N]
it internally, Holanis Arc.[A][N]
[...]Though really, it's half that[N]
and half Lowlands,[A] and it reveals[N]
one of the plot's bigger pacing issues.[A][N]
Chapter 15's neat, though.[A][N]
Big defend maps can either be super[N]
fun and memorable,[A] or a huge[N]
slog,[A] and I like to think this[N]
map leans more towards fun.[A][N]
Especially since Yuyu joins.[A][N]
Fun trivia - there was a server[N]
poll to decide her name.[A][N]
Pandora was actually on the poll[N]
and did very well,[A] but I thought[N]
that'd go better as a class name.[A][N]
Other candidates included Chanel,[A][N]
Dauterive (which was worked into[N]
her last name, Dauterivian),[A][N]
and Mina. Nifty.[A][N]
Also, I commissioned the ASM for[N]
her mechanics from Scraiza,[A][N]
by buying him a copy of Minecraft.[N]
The more you know, I guess.[A][N]
Anyway. Chapter 16's a concept that[N]
floated in my head a long time.[A][N]
A map with an ablaze town and books[N]
as a side objective stuck with me,[A][N]
and so the burning library was reworked[N]
to be the main objective of this map.[A][N]
Plus, it's timed rout, and timed rout[N]
is an awesome objective.[A][N]
After some intriguing plot hooks,[N]
it's Chapter 17 and 18 time.[A][N]
Two maps that I like the gameplay for,[N]
but that do nothing for the plot.[A][N]
They have solid character writing,[N]
but they're ultimately filler,[A][N]
in what's already a fairly short[N]
arc of the plot.[A][N]
18x was a fun experiment, taking the[N]
format of 9x and expanding it.[A][N]
There's also a certain novelty to[N]
being able to deploy everyone.[A][N]
That's just fun.[A][N]
Chapter 19 and 20 get things back[N]
on track,[A] and are two of my[N]
favorite maps.[A] Especially 20.[A][N]
I wanted to go for something unique[N]
and somewhat atmospheric,[A][N]
and decided to build on the concept[N]
of FE6 Chapter 24,[A] both in[N]
gameplay and story purpose.[A][N]
And 20's a pretty solid turning[N]
point for the plot.[A][N]
On that note, though, this part of[N]
the story got an important rewrite.[A][N]
Namely, framing the hiring of the[N]
Viridian Mercenaries around 18x,[A][N]
and making Chapter 20's events more[N]
a meaningful time diversion.[A][N]
That becomes quite relevant come[N]
a few maps later.[A][N]
Things really kick into gear after[N]
it. Well, and after the next arc.[A][N]
But that's another story.[N]
[...]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart6
Viridian Arc[X]

##BonusConvoPart6
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Here's what you've been waiting[N]
for. Another bandit map.[A][N]
[...]Alright, Chapter I is a bit[N]
simple, but it needs to be.[A][N]
You're working with an all new[N]
cast, you need to get used to them.[A][N]
Both in gameplay and story.[A][N]
Same with Chapter II. The first part[N]
of this arc is about familiarity.[A][N]
Getting to know the Viridians, how[N]
they fight, how they interact.[A][N]
II and IIx start to drip Dalst's[N]
influence into the plot,[A][N]
obviously culminating in the events[N]
of Chapter III,[A] and the game[N]
making it clear that, yes,[A] shit's fucked.[A][N]
Chapter IV is timed rout, so it[N]
is another map without flaw.[A][N]
But none of what I've talked about[N]
is why you're here.[A][N]
You're here for Chapter IVx and V.[A][N]
The oldest ideas for this part of[N]
the game had every mercenary die.[A][N]
However, I realized that would make[N]
it an absolute slog to replay,[A][N]
and obviously you can't just skip[N]
this part of the narrative.[A][N]
That's when the idea hit me:[A][N]
you get to choose who lives.[A][N]
It's a setup that leads to a ton of[N]
interesting and tragic interactions,[A][N]
it makes for interesting gameplay with[N]
who you send and what they bring,[A][N]
and the act of sending your units off to[N]
an unknown fate helps amplify one thing:[A][N]
the atmosphere of dread in IVx and V.[A][N]
Perhaps it's a bit forced to make[N]
Viridian act so out of it after IV.[A][N]
But this sequence is, as far as I[N]
can tell,[A] one of the game's most[N]
beloved and memorable.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I like to think I did something right.[A][N]
[...]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart7
Ch. 21 - Ch. 25[X]

##BonusConvoPart7
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Time for the lategame![N]
[...]Lategames are hard.[A][N]
FE lategames often tend to[N]
either be far too trivial,[A][N]
or unbearably inflated.[A][N]
Admittedly, this game might[N]
lean a bit too easy for some,[A][N]
thanks to how insane your tools[N]
get,[A] but part of that is also[N]
systems mastery.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Maybe if you think the game's[N]
easy, you're just a god gamer.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Anyway. Chapter 21. Big reveals[N]
(well, reveals for the characters),[A][N]
and a tense Thracia-ish map.[A][N]
What's not to love, besides maybe[N]
the fog?[A] Fun fact: preps didn't[N]
show you the map in early builds.[A][N]
You had to deal with not knowing[N]
about that Main Gauche user.[A][N]
[...]What the hell, me.[A][N]
Chapter 22's mildly fillery and used[N]
to be a bit linear and easy,[A][N]
but with some rework I think it's[N]
now a fairly tight rout[A], while[N]
still relaxed enough to train units.[A][N]
23's a big moment, and begins a streak[N]
of bosses with a ton of conversations.[A][N]
Much to the pleasure of Bobby Asaka.[A][N]
Fun fact about 24: thanks to the[N]
scene where the Viridians return,[A][N]
it's the map that took the longest[N]
to write for.[A] 165 variants of[N]
one scene will do that.[A][N]
25's another map that got some rework[N]
like 22, though in this case,[A][N]
it's mainly in the form of the boss's[N]
lunatic exclusive Great Swallow,[A][N]
which is kind of a Super Thracia[N]
reference.[A] Because we all needed[N]
more Super Thracia in our lives.[A][N]
Oh yeah. Shoutout to Arin becoming[N]

a bit during Holanis arc.[A][N]
Good for her.[A][N]

Woo, hour long talking map.[A][N]
25x is definitely a bit long-winded,[N]
but I think it's fun and novel.[A][N]
[...]Well, novel if you don't count 18x.[A][N]
Was one of the longest maps to write[N]
for, alongside 24's Return event.[A][N]
Chapter 26 used to not have the Ethyl[N]
simulacra, and was a forced survive.[A][N]
[...]What the hell, me?[A][N]
In the words of some of my testers,[A][N]
the map made you really feel like a[N]
beast in a situation.[A][N]
Still does, but now you can at least[N]
rush it and feel really cool.[A][N]
Same deal with 27, really.[A][N]
Big map that's either a constant barrage[N]
of adapting threats,[A] or a great chance[N]
to flex how good a player you are.[A][N]
The sheer size of lategame can be[N]
intimidating for sure,[A][N]
but I think there's enough room to[N]
blitz maps to keep things interesting.[A][N]
28 is a big emotional payoff in many[N]
different ways,[A] but I don't have[N]
much to say on its development.[A][N]
I guess there's the fun trivia about[N]
its secret shop.[A][N]
Originally, there was one shop that[N]
had everything in the game.[A][N]
Eventually, I split PRFs and legendary[N]
weapons out of that shop into another.[A][N]
If you're curious, that second shop's[N]
on Viridian's starting tile.[A][N]
As for Endgame, final bosses are a big[N]
pain to do in any normal Fire Emblem,[A][N]
let alone one as[...] explosive as this.[A][N]
I eventually settled on a first phase[N]
that's fairly simple,[A] ending off a big[N]
but relatively normal map.[A][N]
Phase two, meanwhile[...] Well, you kill[N]
it quick or you die horribly.[A][N]
I've never liked drawn out bosses in any[N]
RPG, and Fire Emblem's no exception.[A][N]
[...]Sorry I haven't said much about the[N]
writing for this part of the game.[A][N]
I think it speaks for itself quite well,[N]
and that I've long since hit my stride.[A][N]
Epilogue's hopefully evidence of that.[A][N]
Or at least evidence of how mad I am to[N]
make so many conditionals.[A][N]
[...]And that's the end of maingame.[A][N]
Thanks for reading this far, and as[N]
always, goodnight gamers.[A][X]
