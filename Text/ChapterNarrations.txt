##Prologue_Narration
The continent of Ulmaron.[A][N]
In legend, the world[N]
was once a formless thing,[A][N]
brought into being by[N]
the creator god Opistus.[A][N]
As man developed, so too[N]
did an array of great nations.[A][N]
Central among these is Dalst,[N]
a land of eternal progress.[A][N]
Advanced in science and society alike,[A][N]
the Dalstian Alliance comprises many noble[N]
provinces,[A] banded together for[N]
military and academic purposes alike.[A][N]
At the extreme northern edge[N]
of Dalst lies Aercolyn,[A][N]
a small territory which holds[N]
little influence currently,[A][N]
thanks to the disgraceful actions[N]
and subsequent exile of its lord.[A][N]
Since then, Blair, the heir to Aercolyn,[A][N]
has tirelessly worked towards restoration[N]
of the territory's influence,[A][N]
which has culminated in an invitation-[A][N]
one calling Blair to the[N]
Dalstian capital of Arbordia.[A][N]
Blair prepares to set off[N]
towards re-legitimizing Aercolyn.[A][N]
As humanity strides onward oblivious,[N]
the world is waking to a new era.[A][X]

##Ch1_Narration
The former Kingdom of Mevion.[A][N]
Since time immemorial, Mevion has[N]
been ruled by proud monarchies.[A][N]
12 years ago, everything changed,[A][N]
when the freshly crowned king[N]
raised taxes to oppressive levels.[A][N]
Almost overnight, a rebellion[N]
formed, and bloody civil war began.[A][N]
Eventually, the monarchy was overthrown,[N]
and a democratic-republic was formed,[A][N]
where man could elect representatives.[A][N]
Thus began the golden age of[N]
the Reborn Mevionese Republic.[A][N]
The nation maintains uneasy peace[N]
with Dalst,[A] as Dalstian nobility[N]
fears possible rebellion at home.[A][N]
Considering all of this,[A] Blair is tasked[N]
with investigating the Mevionese border,[A][N]
following rumors of violence.[A][X]

##Ch2_Narration
The Empire of Yg'stra.[N]
A rugged civilization.[A][N]
Rather than traditional succession[N]
through bloodlines,[A] Yg'stran rulers[N]
are decided through strength.[A][N]
Their culture embodies this philosophy,[N]
and most Yg'strans serve their army.[A][N]
Despite this, Yg'stra was never seen as[N]
belligerent-[A] thus an attack on the[N]
Aercolyn barracks blindsides Dalst.[A][N]
Blair rushes out into battle, hoping[N]
to find answers and stop a potential war.[A][X]

##Ch3_Narration
Although Blair's forces proved victorious,[N]
the conflict was far from over.[A][N]
Dalst had no intentions of letting this[N]
go unanswered,[A] and thus a small force was[N]
assembled to probe into Yg'stra.[A][N]
Although the risks are high, Blair wishes[N]
to lead, as if to prove herself to Dalst-[A][N]
and so, Blair sets off towards[N]
the Yg'stran-controlled Lowlands.[A][X]

##Ch4_Narration
The appearance of the Yg'stran commander[N]
drives the Dalstians out of the Lowlands.[A][N]
Blair sees no choice but to retreat[N]
to Mevion,[A] as the Yg'strans force[N]
her further and further out of Aercolyn.[A][N]
Though she regrets abandoning Dalst,[N]
she knows she'll return one day.[A][X]

##Ch5_Narration
The swampy terrain of Mevion serves[N]
a dual purpose-[A] fostering rich wildlife[N]
and foliage,[A] while also serving as nigh[N]
impregnable natural defense.[A][N]
Indeed, Blair's small force is able to[N]
evade the Yg'strans,[A] who cannot keep[N]
their momentum in the dense swamps.[A][N]
Blair ventures further into Mevion to seek[N]
refuge, but is met by hostility.[A][X]

##Base1_Narration
After the fall of the Mevionese royal[N]
family,[A] a new capital city was[N]
established, Kionius.[A] Named for an[N]
ancient Mevionese war hero,[A] Kionius[N]
has become a hub of commerce.[A][N]
It is here where the Parliament of[N]
Mevion convenes,[A] and where Blair's[N]
party shall pause and regroup.[A][X]

##Ch6_Narration
The Kingdom of Elba Cor.[A][N]
In ages past, the founders of Mevion[N]
and Elba Cor were a pair of heroes.[A][N]
This kinship has waned over time,[A][N]
especially after the Mevionese[N]
Revolution-[A] during which the young[N]
Elba Corian prince Zeke vanished,[A][N]
and was presumed dead.[A] Although Mevion[N]
denies involvement,[A] the populace of[N]
Elba Cor-[A] a people proud of their stalwart[N]
kings-[A] generally distrusts Mevion.[A][N]
As such, Blair is surprised when a pair of[N]
Elba Corians arrive,[A] bearing a royal[N]
decree and an offer of assistance.[A][X]

##Ch7_Narration
Blair and company arrive in Elba Cor,[A][N]
following a tense encounter with[N]
Mevion's bandits.[A] The party has been[N]
summoned to meet with the king,[A][N]
sympathetic to Blair's plight.[A][N]
However, the road there will not be easy,[A][N]
as Elba Cor's harsh mountains are home[N]
to harsher banditry,[A] and as Yg'stra[N]
plans to mount an invasion.[A][X]

##Ch8_Narration
Mt. Loile.[A][N]
Every year, this massive volcano erupts,[N]
spewing ash and dust along the continent.[A][N]
Interpretations of the volcano are[N]
vast and varied-[A] some see it as[N]
Opistus's wrath incarnate,[A] and others[N]
see it as the earth itself crying out.[A][N]
As thanks for protection and assistance,[A][N]
Blair offers to bring down a gang[N]
of bandits who have,[A] for unknown[N]
reason, made the lava fields their turf.[A][X]

##Base2_Narration
Because Elba Cor is surrounded on land[N]
by dense mountain ranges,[A] much of[N]
its trade and travel is by sea.[A][N]
As such, several prosperous port[N]
towns exist on the northern coast.[A][N]
Due to its relative closeness to the[N]
capital city Couria,[A] Port[N]
Moneubris,[A] named in honor of[N]
Saint Moneubris, is among the most[N]
vibrant and bustling ports.[A][N]
Moneubris is revered for saving the[N]
life of the seventh king's heir,[A][N]
and similarly, the port serves as[N]
the lifeblood of Elba Cor, in a sense.[A][X]

##Ch9_Narration
Blair's party escapes the[N]
Yg'stran forces via sea,[A][N]
hoping to trail the coastline[N]
and arrive in Opistia.[A][N]
However, just as banditry plagues[N]
the land,[A] so too does piracy plague[N]
the seas of Ulmaron.[A][N]
Thus, Blair and company are drawn[N]
into the defense of a small ship.[A][X]

##Base3_Narration
Survivors from the Opistian vessel[N]
are allowed to travel with Blair,[A][N]
both as an act of goodwill and[N]
to appeal to Opistia.[A][N]
finish this later plz ok ily[A][X]

##Ch10_Narration
As unexpected Yg'stran naval[N]
forces emerge from several sides,[A][N]
the Tradewinds is set aflame.[A][N]
As the ship begins to sink and[N]
Yg'stran forces close in,[A][N]
Cid reveals his hand and[N]
commandeers a nearby vessel.[A][N]
However, commandeering is only[N]
half the battle:[A][N]
the Yg'stran navy stands between[N]
Blair's party and the ship to freedom.[A][X]

##Ch11_Narration
The Theocracy of Opistia.[A][N]
[X]

##Ch12_Narration
The Tower of Opistus.[A][N]
Built millenia ago to honor[N]
Opistus and to,[A] quite literally,[N]
reach new heights of spirituality,[A][N]
the Tower of Opistus is a marvel[N]
of architecture.[A] About 23 years[N]
ago,[A] Dalst came to Yg'stra with[N]
a unique offer:[A] to extend the Tower's[N]
height,[A] through magically augmented[N]
materials and design.[A] Thus, the Tower[N]
now reaches the edge of the heavens,[N][A]
a testament to faith and knowledge's[N]
harmony.[A] Blair's party, as a[N]
traditional Opistinian ritual,[A][N]
is sent on a trial within the tower,[A][N]
while Opistia prepares to invade Yg'stra.[A][X]

##Base4_Narration

##ChZ1_Narration
The fallen kingdom of Holanis.[N]
A barren and dying land.[A][N]
In a forgotten age, the nation[N]
had prospered like few other.[A][N]
Similarly to Dalst, knowledge[N]
was one of their key resources.[A][N]
However, a calamity long forgotten[N]
by history scoured the land,[A][N]
with almost none living to tell[N]
their tales,[A] and only in the[N]
past century have settlers returned.[A][N]
Within the barren wasteland,[N]
a young light grows.[A][N]
A youth whose was thought to[N]
have been lost twelve years prior.[A][N]
After years of doubt and hardship,[N]
Hyperius's journey has borne fruit.[A][N]
...Prince Zeke is alive.[A][X]

##ChV1_Narration
The sorrow of the commoners is often gone ignored.[A][N]
No nation can ensure life goes on smoothly,[N]
and thus few even try.[A][N]
Those outside of the military hold it in contempt,[N]
for their true heroes are the land's mercenaries.[A][N]
Indeed, Ulmaron's tense politics[N]
breed lucrative mercenaries.[A][N]
Of these mercenary groups, the most beloved is perhaps[N]
the Viridian Mercenaries, named after their leader,[A][N]
an valorous man who wishes to serve the people,[A][N]
and to spread hope for the future amidst the[N]
aftermath of the Elba Cor-Yg'stran War.[A][X]
