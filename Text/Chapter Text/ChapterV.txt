##ArcViridianEnding
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
All was for naught in the end.[N]
And yet, life must carry on.[A][N]
After all, there is nothing but[N]
the future left ahead.[A][N]
The glorious future that Dalst[N]
fights for.[A][N]
...The future that will bring[N]
about the end of all.[A][X]

##ThereWillBeNoSalvation
You've made it far.[N]
...All must fall.[A][X]

##_V5SysText
Units can now die without[N]
causing a game over.[A][N]
...Good luck.[A][X]

13 turns.[X]

##V5CiraweissBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
I know not why you're here.[N]
But you cannot be here.[A][N]
[...]Therefore, you must die.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Might of the stars[...][N]
Come down to earth[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
Lay waste to all![A][X]

##V5CiraweissElizaBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
I think[...] I've seen your[N]
face before. In paintings.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Glad to see the youth know me.[N]
[...]Almost makes this hurt.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissDirkBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
Hey, you! Aren't you the[N]
lord of Ciraweiss?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Is that your homeland?[N]
I'd return, if I were you.[A][N]
[...]Actually, I'm not going to[N]
give you that chance. Sorry.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissViridianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Ah, I see. That[N]
merc from Arbordia.[A][N]
Small world, I guess.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
You're[...] Ciraweiss's lord[...][N]
What're you doing here?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Science. And the like.[A][N]
Nothing that needs to leave[N]
this place.[A][N]
[...]Speaking of not leaving,[N]
you're about to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]So you're all the same, then.[A][N]
[...]This ends now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss][ToggleSmile]
Yes. It does.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissFreddricBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]I think I see now.[N]
The Dalstians want us gone.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Perhaps. But I'm sure you're[N]
used to treacherous clients.[A][N]
And I know what your group did.[A][N]
Defying Tarquin.[A][N]
Not a good plan.[A][N]
Really, you brought this[N]
upon yourselves.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[...]And you brought what's coming[N]
to you upon yourself.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissChartreuseBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
A harmless bard.[A][N]
[...]Well, she's one of them.[N]
No helping this.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissEstelleBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
So, the benefactor becomes an[N]
evil beyond all compare[...][A][N]
I should've seen this coming.[A][N]
It's[...] the crux of every[N]
enduring tragedy.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Are you sure you're[N]
in the right place?[A][X]

##V5CiraweissManfredBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
A dark scholar, I see.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadManfred]
That I am. I can simply tell[...][N]
The secrets behind that door[...][A][N]
They're beyond compare! I[N]
must see what lies within.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Sorry to tell you, but we're[N]
not looking for more manpower.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Tell you what, though.[A][N]
Survive this, and I'll put[N]
in a good word for you.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissArgentBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadArgent]
Ethyl von Ciraweiss.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
I feel like I should know you.[N]
You're from[...] Mevion, right?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent]
Once, I was a revered general.[N]
But now, I am but a warrior.[A][N]
Tell me[...] Why is one[N]
of your station here?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
I don't think I will.[A][N]
And now I've gotta get[N]
rid of you.[A][X]

##V5CiraweissDefeat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You're[...] skilled.[N]
I'll give you that.[A][N]
[...]But I must be off[...][N]
Sorry to disappoint.[A][N]
But you're not gonna[N]
kill me today.[A][N]
[...]Take this. It won't[...][N]
save you anyway[...][A][X]

##V5_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadChartreuse][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And now we wait.[A][N]
No matter what, we have[N]
to hold this position.[A][N]
Hopefully, we'll hear from[N]
the scouts[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure[...] it'll all be fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I truly hope so too.[A][N]
[...]Will hope continue to[N]
carry us?[A][X]

##V5_Opening2
[OpenLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenFarLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]I see you've returned.[A][N]
I was just about to take[N]
over watch duty.[A][N]
[...]Care to spare me that?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alas. We've work to do.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn. Worth a try.[A][X]

##V5_Opening3
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Well, it's usually nothing, anyway.[A][N]
Still[...] Should at least pretend[N]
to care about this.[A][N]
Well, the patrols are out already.[N]
And if anyone draws near, well[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
We can get some nice data points[N]
on Starfall's combat capabilities.[A][X]

##V5_Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
They've patrols approaching.[N]
[...]This is it.[A][N]
Do or die.[A][N]
[...]We just have to hang on[N]
until the lady arrives.[A][N]
We need not approach Jraeyan[N]
itself yet.[A] That defensive[N]
formation looks impenetrable.[A][N]
[...]My friends[...] I am sorry for leading[N]
you this far.[A] But I am also[N]
thankful beyond words.[A][N]
[...]I[...] know we'll prevail.[N]
It's[...] the only way.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
[...]Onwards, Viridian Mercenaries![N]
I will lead us to glory![A][X]

##V5_CiraweissNotice
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Of course today's the day[N]
there's a security issue.[A][N]
[...]Well, let's see if I've got[N]
this invocation memorized[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Light![A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Yup. You'd have to have[N]
been blind to miss that.[A][N]
Well, then. Some backup should[N]
be here momentarily.[A][X]

##V5_CiraweissLeaves
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]They're persistent.[A][N]
That bothers me. [...]I think I've[N]
an idea, though.[A][N]
Just gotta go let Girard know.[N]
[...]He'll be excited to hear.[A][X]

##V5_CiraweissLeft
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]They're[...] still at it?[A][N]
[...]Perhaps[...] this is[...][N]
our chance[...][A][N][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Where are you, Girard?[N]
It's[...] time to begin.[A][X]

##V5_CiraweissAndGirard
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ah, Ethyl. What do you require?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I think[...] it's time.[N]
How many copies do we have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]More than enough.[A][N]
It'll take a bit to arm[N]
our sages with it.[A][N]
And it might[...] drain them a bit.[N]
Magic this strong is fickle.[A][N]
It could be quite some time before[N]
we can use it again.[A][N]
[...]I say it's well worth it to see[N]
what happens.[A] And, of course,[N]
to deal with these mercenaries.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see. And agree. [...]Might I deploy[N]
the wyverns while we wait?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure. Just stand back a bit.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent. This'll be[...][N]
fascinating to watch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just make sure to recall them[N]
once the mercenaries are dealt with.[A][N]
Wouldn't want to cause undue damage.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Thanks, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Certainly. You've long been a faithful[N]
colleague.[A] And with these tests, our[N]
dreams may finally come to fruition.[A][X]

##V5_CiraweissAndGirard2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's time.[A][N]
All who oppose us shall[N]
be brought to their knees.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Excellent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]The world I see is at last[N]
within my grasp.[A][N]
Everything[...] will be worth it.[A][X]

##V5_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]That's the last of them.[N]
They're all[...] dead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. It's[...] unfortunate.[N]
But it had to be this way.[A][N]
They suspected too much. They[N]
defied Tarquin.[A] And they were[N]
about to join her party.[A][X]

##V5_EndingAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian][OpenMidLeft]
[...]A shame they were so weak.[A][N]
Ethyl would've loved the field[N]
data on Annihilation.[A][N]
Especially since the mere act of[N]
arming our men squandered its power.[A][N]
[...]I'll have to make it up to her.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] must admit, it's[N]
quite the surprise.[A][N]
Was their prior performance[N]
all but a fluke?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. In any case, it had[N]
to be this way.[A][N]
They suspected too much. They[N]
defied Tarquin.[A] And they were[N]
about to join her party.[A][X]

##V5_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
What do you[...] make of[N]
the young Lady Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
She is of Dalst, despite everything.[N]
She shall be welcomed back to us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But what if she refuses?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If she wishes to deny us[...][N]
I will not try to persuade her.[A][N]
Of course, she will have to die.[N]
But, she's done much for us.[A][N]
I'm[...] a reasonable man.[A][N]
It'd only be fair to put aside[N]
our world-altering power.[A][N]
Give her a chance to stand[N]
up to us.[A] Perhaps that too[N]
will lead to a better tomorrow.[A][N]
Besides, today has been[...] draining.[N]
Many good men fell.[A][N]
Our finest tomes need to[N]
replenish their power.[A][N]
[...]But enough of that.[A][N]
I must return to Arbordia.[N]
You know what to do from here.[A][N]
[...]Let us hope these prototypes turn[N]
out better than that rebel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I believe I've[...] fixed that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. It'd be a shame for[N]
such talent to go to waste.[A][N]
Let it fight for our future.[A][X]

##V5ViridianDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
This is[...] what I deserve[...][N]
for draggin' her into this[...][A][CloseEyes][X]

##V5EstelleDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
Our lives[...] Out like a[...][N]

A dismal tale[...] of[N]
no significance[...][A][X]

##V5RoseDeath

Is[...] this really it[...]?[N]

##V5DirkDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
Is that[...] the best[...][N]

##V5ManfredDeathAfterWilhelm
[OpenMidRight][LoadManfred]
You just[...] had to die on me[...][N]
Well[...] I'm coming, friend[...][A][CloseEyes][X]

##V5WilhelmDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm]
It's funny[...] really[...][N]
After everything[...][A][N][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Dying here[...] isn't[N]
