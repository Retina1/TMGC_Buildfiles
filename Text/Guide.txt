Movement Skills[X]

##GuideMovementSkillsDesc
All infantry classes have[N]
Shove. Heroes, Swordmasters,[N]
and Assassina have Swap.[N]
Snipers, Assassins,[N]
and Generals have Pivot.[N]
Halberdiers have[N]
Reposition. Warriors,[N]
Berserkers, and[N]
Generals have Smite.[N]
Certain units may also get[N]
these, plus the skill Swarp,[N]
as personal skills.[N]
Hopefully, this will help[N]
non-staff infantry contribute[N]
when the game inevitably[N]
devolves into skips.[X]

##GuideChanges
Basic Changes[X]

##GuideChangesDesc
Weapon triangle is now[N]
+/-2 Mt and +/-10 Hit.[N]
Additionally, S Ranks now[N]
give +3 might and +10 hit.[N][N]
Supports have been completely[N]
reworked, though bonuses[N]
are still based on proximity.[N][N]
Many weapons have significantly[N]
higher stats than vanilla.[N][N]
Enemies get +5 hit on Hard,[N]
and +10 hit on Lunatic.[N]
Additionally, enemies (including[N]
recruitables) get HMB.[N][N]
Magic weapons do not grant[N]
WEXP, but combat staves do.[N][N]
Unpromoted units learn a skill[N]
at level 15. Some may also learn[N]
a skill upon promotion.[N]
Promoted units may learn skills[N]
as they level up, with no[N]
set pattern. See character[N]
guide entries for skill[N]
and level information.[X]

##GuideBase
Base and Supports[X]

##GuideBaseDesc
During battle preparations,[N]
Base Conversations can be[N]
read. They provide a wealth[N]
of benefits, and a wealth of[N]
lore. Convos marked with !!![N]
grant concrete benefits,[N]
such as items and units.[N]
Convos marked with !![N]
contain valuable gameplay hints,[N]
such as mechanic overviews[N]
and map gimmicks.[N]
Convos marked with ![N]
are unimportant beyond[N]
providing some flavor[N]
and worldbuilding.[N]
Convos with no ! displayed[N]
will instead be formatted as[N]
[OpenQuote]___ and ___[CloseQuote].[N]
These are supports.[N]
Activating a support will[N]
increase that pair's support[N]
rank. Prior supports must have[N]
been activated earlier in[N]
the game (ex. you must have[N]
gotten Blair/Arin C to be able[N]
to activate Blair/Arin C+).[N]
Depending on the exact pair,[N]
supports can have up to 7[N]
different ranks-[N]
C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, and A.[N]
A unit can have 5 supports,[N]
with no limit on ranks.[N]
Support bonuses are determined[N]
on a pair-by-pair and[N]
rank-by-rank basis- affinity[N]
doesn't exist anymore.[N]
Sometimes, it may also be[N]
possible to improve support[N]
rank via talk conversations.[X]

##GuideAercolyn
Aercolyn[X]

##GuideAercolynDesc
A territory at the north[N]
tip of the Dalstian Alliance.[N]
Some time ago, the previous lord[N]
of Aercolyn, Blair's father,[N]
committed acts ruled to be[N]
high treason by Dalst,[N]
and was subsequently exiled[N]
while the territory's influence[N]
over Dalstian politics was[N]
rapidly diminished.[N][N]
Currently, the state operates[N]
independently under the rule[N]
of Blair and her advisors,[N]
with a distinct military from[N]
the Allied Dalstian Army.[X]

##GuideDalst
Dalst[X]

##GuideDalstDesc
An alliance of noble territories,[N]
whose most noteworthy export[N]
is knowledge and magical talent.[N]
Notable houses include Neillstrom,[N]
who provides the single largest[N]
contribution to the nation's army,[N]
Ciraweiss, who's known for their[N]
agricultural contributions[N]
(most notably a tender wood[N]
used in most staves), and[N]
Arbordia, a central territory[N]
used as the nation's capital.[X]

Opistia[X]

##GuideOpistiaDesc
A desert land ruled by[N]
the Opistian Church.[N]
Its capital, Opistinia, was[N]
built around an ancient oasis,[N]
which, much like many other[N]
Opistinian landmarks, is seen[N]
as a great blessing.[N]
One of Opistia's oldest landmarks[N]
is the manmade Tower of Opistia,[N]
built to honor Opistus.[N]
In relatively recent years,[N]
the tower was expanded into[N]
something of a space elevator[N]
through a collaborative effort[N]
with Dalst, and since then,[N]
the two nations have become[N]
unlikely allies.[X]

An armored knight of Dalst,[N]
known for his devotion and[N]
his strong sense of honor-[N]
even if [OpenQuote]honor[CloseQuote] isn't a[N]
term most associate with[N]
his grave-robbery.[N][N]
From a young age, Josef's[N]
family was on the poorer side,[N]
and he lived under a zero-waste[N]
mindset. As he eventually joined[N]
the Dalstian army to support[N]
his family, this manifested[N]
itself as a tendency to hoard[N]
anything of value he could[N]
from the bodies of his enemies.[N]
Once his finances stabilized,[N]
and he had a chance to reflect[N]
on his harrowing actions, Josef[N]
changed- and decided that the[N]
only fair way to grave-rob[N]
would be to leave a generous[N]
equivalent of gold behind.[N][N]
