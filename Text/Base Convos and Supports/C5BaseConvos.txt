Looks like it's getting dark.[N]
This could be bad.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]How so?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]If it gets too dark, we[N]
obviously can't see the enemy.[A][N]
That'll make planning attacks difficult.[A][N]
We'll only be able to confirm the[N]
presence of nearby enemies.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, but if we bump into one,[N]
can't we just quickly attack?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose so, though attacking on[N]
the fly like that may be risky.[A][N]
A better idea may be trying to[N]
find light sources.[A][N]
If we can set torches ablaze, we'll[N]
be at a vision advantage-[A][N]
especially since I don't see us getting[N]
handheld torches any time soon.[A][N]
Of course, it's quite possible these torches[N]
could signal enemies, so be careful.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I've heard rumors of[N]
thief-ish types having better eyesight-[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, there's a reason they're only rumors.[A][N]
My sight is no better than yours,[N]
or anyone in our army.[A][N]
Sorry to disappoint.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]So in summary, it's not all lost[N]
if we bump into unexpected foes,[A][N]
and the only lights we can rely on are[N]
from what torches we find on the field.[A][N]
This'll be quite tough, but I'm[N]
sure we can manage.[A][X]

Come to think of it...[N]
I don't think I've been to Mevion.[A][N]
Funny that this is how I end up[N]
here for the first time.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Have you ever really left Dalst?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I guess not. I've always either been too young[N]
or too busy with Aercolyn for travel.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Guess that's another thing you could[N]
blame my father for.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But enough about that.[A][N]
What about you? Have you[N]
been to Mevion?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Not anything further than its extreme edge.[N]
Guess I've just never felt the need.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I guess a war's a good excuse[N]
as any to see the world a bit.[A][N]
...I wonder what the rest of Dalst[N]
is doing about Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's where it gets interesting.[A][N]
It seems that fewer Yg'strans have[N]
been on our tail as we've entered Mevion.[A][N]
Of course, the terrain's a possible cause,[N]
but to cause a drop off like this,[A][N]
I'd imagine that someone has to[N]
be intervening.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see- Dalst might've finally[N]
entered the conflict.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps. ...Or maybe...[N]
Hm...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe what?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Forget I said anything.[N]
I'm just thinking through something.[A][N]
All that is to say, we're doing well.[N]
Being alive now is proof of that.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's hope we both stay that way![N]
...Alive, I mean.[A][X]

Kenneth of Neillstrom! I challenge you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]You... challenge me?[N]
To what, a duel?[A][N]
I'd rather not.[A][N]
...Wait. How did you know[N]
my noble title?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]It is a knight's duty to know all[N]
who may fall under his protection![A][N]
Young Kenneth of Neillstrom, a graduate of[N]
the Northern Arbordian Academy,[A][N]
17 years old, whose favorite tea blend[N]
is an earthy chamomile-[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]How in the hell do you know all this?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I have my methods.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's hardly an answer![A][N]
I don't think I've ever seen you before[N]
the skirmish at the barracks,[A][N]
yet you somehow have encyclopedic[N]
knowledge about me![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...So you're jealous of my methods...[N]
I see, I see...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]At face value, your methods involve[N]
the nation's most sophisticated spies![A][N]
...Did Blair put you up to this?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Absolutely not![N]
Anyway, what about my challenge?[A][N]
...I honestly can't remember[N]
your answer.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]You can remember the minutiae of my life,[N]
but not an answer from a minute ago?[A][N]
...Maybe I'll take this chance to knock[N]
some sense into you after all.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent, my good sir![N]
Now... En garde![A][X]
