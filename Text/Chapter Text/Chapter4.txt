##_Ch4Escape
Escape with[N]
all units.[X]

##Ch4_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
What's our plan? We don't have much[N]
more time before Yg'stra catches up.[A][N]
Honestly, we're incredibly lucky to have[N]
made it this far.[A] It's as if they just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
stopped chasing us, for a while.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We have to keep running,[N]
but where?[A] The obvious choice would[N]
be southern Dalst[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]There's a chance that the[N]
Yg'strans already made it there.[A][N]
Especially given the silence towards[N]
our recent message.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That leaves us with[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Mevion.[A][N]
We're too far west to turn upwards[N]
towards Elba Cor.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine Mevion's patrols wouldn't[N]
gladly welcome us,[A] but we lack the[N]
luxury of a better option now.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We've fought back Mevion before.[N]
I'm sure we can do it again.[A][N]
We have to do it again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let's hope you're right.[A][X]

##Ch4_Ending
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy]
This way, you nutcases![N]
Follow me- I know where to go![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Is everyone here?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm hardly the right person to ask,[N]
but probably?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't think I saw anyone[N]
else out there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
No time to doubt myself.[N]
Let's get a move on.[A][X]

##Ch4_Ending_Dead_Peggy
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadArin]
This way, Blair. I believe[N]
I saw everyone pass.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]She helped us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And then she died[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's tragic, but unfortunately,[N]
we're short on time to mourn.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you're right.[A][N]
We have to keep moving[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
For everyone else.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][X]

##Ch4_Ending_2
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
Damn it! How the hell did[N]
they escape?![A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter.[N]
They'll fall[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] soon enough[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Whelps![A][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3][OpenMidRight] Chase them into Mevion![N]
I've got business to attend to.[A][N]
After all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] There's another country[N]
entirely to conquer.[A][X]

##Ch4_Ending_3
[OpenLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's what our scouts saw,[N]
your majesty.[A] We fear that Yg'stra[N]
may be preparing to invade.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Northern Dalst does provide a[N]
relatively clear stretch to invade from.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What of the noble territory?[N]
Aercolyn, was it?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]While unconfirmed in identity, there were[N]
reports of a small group fleeing west,[A][N]
pursued by both Mevion and Yg'stra.[A][N]
There's a fairly high chance that the[N]
former lord's daughter was among them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]And where are they now?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]I'd imagine they're barely in Mevion now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[A] I have a task[N]
I must ask of you.[A] Fly out and attempt[N]
to contact the young lady.[A][N]
Tell her that she has an ally[N]
in Elba Cor.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHyperius]With all due respect, your majesty,[N]
can we so easily trust Dalst?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I understand your concerns, General Hyperius.[N]
But this is a chance I'm willing to take.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. Apologies, your majesty.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]All is well. After[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] after what happened[N]
ten years ago[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] A bit of caution[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Your majesty. My mission?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, right. Almost got lost in the past.[A][N]
Take this royal seal[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveMidRight][N]
That should serve as proof of who you are.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]If you will, Rachael, I'd recommend bringing[N]
backup along, in case trouble strikes.[A][N]
[OpenRight][LoadCassius]Did you say backup?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Good heavens! How long have you been[N]
hiding back there?[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]About twelve hours.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite dedicated.[N]
You heard the details.[A][N]
Are you willing to assist[N]
with this task, young man?[A][N]
[OpenRight]I'm not a knight for nothing.[N]
I'll accompany you, Rachael.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] great to hear, Cassius.[N]
We leave in half an hour.[A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure this is the best idea?[N]
Them specifically?[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know I'm still here, right?[A][X]


##C4PeggyJoin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy]
Oy! What's all this ruckus?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Ruckus? Do you mean this battle?[A][N]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see we're nearing your church.[N]
Sorry about that![A] We'll try and keep[N]
any fighting far away from sacred grounds.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's hardly an issue-[A][N]
I was just glum because nobody called[N]
me over to beat up these dolts![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] WANT to fight Mevion?[N]
Isn't this church[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] in Mevion?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's all very hazy. In any case,[N]
I can want to knock 'em all around anyway![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] great. However, fighting isn't[N]
our priority.[A] We're actually also on[N]
the run from Yg'stra, as it happens.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Dalstians fleeing into Mevion[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Quite the bold move, I'd say![A][N]
Luckily, if you head further west, the[N]
anti-Dalstian sentiment weakens.[A][N]
Hell, by the time you reach our capital,[N]
Kionius, you may find yourself accepted![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'm glad to know that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, damn me! Forgot to introduce myself.[N]
The name's Peggy.[A] Woman of the cloth.[N]
Or so they say. You know what?[A][N]
Your journey sounds rather interesting-[N]
I think I'll come along![A][N]
Don't worry- I've got a healing staff[N]
and a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not-healing staff.[A][N]
I can handle myself just fine.[A][X]

##C4StarqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarque]
Dalstians[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My vengeance[N]
shall come to fruition![A][N]
I will kill you in the[N]
name of my brother, Marque![A][X]

##C4StarqueDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarque]
Grah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] So this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
is it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Dying[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to bloody[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Dalstians[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] how you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
felt[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][X]

##C4LazarusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
I am Lazarus.[A][N]
No point in wasting any[N]
words more on a corpse.[A][N]
Prepare to die![A][X]

##C4LazarusDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Urgh! How in the hell[N]
did you do that?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't think this is over.[A][N]
Next we meet, you will[N]
absolutely perish.[A][X]

##Ch4_Get_Moving
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I think I see the Yg'strans behind us.[N]
We should probably pick up the pace.[A][X]

##Ch4_Get_Out
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] their commander[N]
behind us?[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This isn't good[N]
at all.[A] We need to escape. Now.[A][X]

##Ch4_Lazarus_Arrives
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] They're on the run.[N]
Their fear[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Let it fuel us.[A][N]
They flee because they know they[N]
cannot win.[A] Our victory will[N]
be absolute.[A][X]

##C4Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStarque]
So, the Dalstians are back.[A][N]
They brought great shame upon my[N]
beloved brother, Marque.[A][N]
But today[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'll have my revenge![A][N]
Men! As the Dalstians advance,[N]
jump out and surround them![A][X]

##Ch4_PeggyChurch
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
If I'm gonna be gone for a while,[N]
I should probably stock up a bit.[A][N]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Aha! I knew the offering chest wouldn't[N]
let me down! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]300 gold. Not bad.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll repay it. Eventually. But[N]
it does no good sitting in a chest.[A][X]
