##Prologue_Narration
The continent of Ulmaron.[N]
A land of promise.[A][N]
Of potential.[A][N]
Of strife.[A][N]
In legend, the world[N]
was once a formless thing,[A][N]
brought into being by[N]
the creator god Opistus.[A][N]
As man developed, so too[N]
did an array of great nations.[A][N]
Central among these is Dalst,[N]
a land of eternal progress.[A][N]
Advanced in science and[N]
society alike,[A][N]
the Dalstian Alliance[N]
comprises many noble provinces,[A][N]
banded together for military[N]
and academic purposes alike.[A][N]
At the extreme northern edge[N]
of Dalst lies Aercolyn,[A][N]
a small territory which holds[N]
little influence currently,[A][N]
thanks to the disgraceful actions[N]
and subsequent exile of its lord.[A][N]
Since then, Blair,[N]
the heir to Aercolyn,[A][N]
has tirelessly worked[N]
towards restoration[A][N]
of the territory's influence,[A][N]
which has culminated[N]
in an invitation-[A][N]
one calling Blair to the[N]
Dalstian capital of Arbordia.[A][N]
Blair prepares to set off[N]
towards re-legitimizing Aercolyn,[A][N]
and thus, the threshold[N]
of fate is cast open.[A][X]

##Ch1_Narration
The former Kingdom of Mevion.[N]
Since time immemorial,[A][N]
Mevion has been ruled[N]
by proud monarchies.[A][N]
However, 12 years ago,[N]
everything changed,[A][N]
when the freshly crowned king[N]
raised taxes to oppressive levels.[A][N]
Almost overnight, a rebellion[N]
formed, and bloody civil war began.[A][N]
Eventually, the monarchy was[N]
overthrown, and in its place,[A][N]
a democratic-republic was formed,[A][N]
where man could elect[N]
representatives.[A][N]
Thus began the golden age of[N]
the Reborn Mevionese Republic.[A][N]
The nation maintains uneasy peace[N]
with Dalst,[A] as Dalstian nobility[N]
fears possible rebellion at home.[A][N]
Considering all of this,[A][N]
Blair is tasked with quelling[N]
violence at the Mevion-Dalst border.[A][X]

##Ch2_Narration
The Empire of Yg'stra.[N]
A rugged civilization.[A][N]
Rather than a traditional line[N]
of succession,[A] Yg'stran rulers[N]
are decided through strength.[A][N]
Their culture embodies this[N]
philosophy,[A] and most Yg'strans[N]
serve their army in some regard.[A][N]
Despite this, Yg'stra was never[N]
known to be belligerent-[A][N]
which is why a sudden attack on[N]
the Aercolyn barracks[A][N]
blindsides even Dalst's finest[N]
tactical minds.[A][N]
Blair rushes out into battle,[N]
hoping to find answers.[A][X]

##Ch3_Narration
Although Blair's forces proved[N]
victorious,[A] the conflict[N]
was far from over.[A][N]
Dalst had no intentions of[N]
letting this go unanswered,[A][N]
and thus a small force was[N]
assembled to probe into Yg'stra.[A][N]
Although the risks are high,[N]
Blair wishes to lead,[A][N]
as to prove herself to Dalst-[A][N]
and so, Blair sets off towards[N]
the Yg'stran-controlled Lowlands.[A][X]

##Ch4_Narration
The sudden appearance of the[N]
Yg'stran central army[A][N]
drives the Dalstian forces[N]
out of the Lowlands.[A][N]
Blair sees no choice but to[N]
retreat towards Mevion,[A][N]
as the Yg'strans force her[N]
further out of Aercolyn.[A][N]
Though she regrets abandoning[N]
Dalst, she knows she'll return.[A][X]

##Ch5_Narration
The swampy terrain of Mevion[N]
serves a dual purpose-[A][N]
fostering rich wildlife and[N]
foilage,[A] while also serving[N]
as an impregnable natural defense.[A][N]
Indeed, Blair's small force is[N]
able to evade the Yg'strans,[A][N]
who cannot keep their momentum[N]
through the dense jungles and swamps,[A][N]
and thus, Blair ventures further into[N]
Mevion to seek aid and refuge.[A][X]

##Base1_Narration
After the fall of the[N]
Mevionese royal family,[A][N]
a new capital city was[N]
established, Kionius.[A][N]
Named for an ancient[N]
Mevionese war hero,[A][N]
Kionius has become a hub[N]
of commerce and governance.[A][N]
It is here where the[N]
Parliament of Mevion meets,[A][N]
and where Blair's party shall[N]
pause and regain composure.[A][X]

##Ch6_Narration
The Kingdom of Elba Cor.[A][N]
In ages past, the founding kings[N]
of Mevion and Elba Cor[A][N]
were a pair of war heroes.[A][N]
This kinship has waned over time,[A][N]
especially after the Mevionese[N]
Revolution-[A] during which the[N]
young Elba Corian prince Zeke[A][N]
vanished, and was presumed dead.[A][N]
Although Mevion denies involvement,[N]
the populace of Elba Cor-[A][N]
a people extremely proud of their[N]
stalwart kings-[A] overwhelmingly[N]
distrusts Mevion.[A] As such,[N]
Blair is quite surprised when[A][N]
a pair of Elba Corians arrive,[N]
claiming to bear a royal decree.[A][X]

##Ch7_Narration
Blair and company arrive[N]
in Elba Cor,[A] believing[N]
the mountains to be respite[A][N]
from the Yg'Stran pursuit.[A][N]
The party has been summoned[N]
to meet with the king,[A][N]
sympathetic to Blair's plight.[A][N]
However, the road there will[N]
not be easy,[A][N]
as Elba Cor's harsh mountains[N]
are home to harsher banditry.[A][X]

##Ch8_Narration
Mt. Loile.[A][N]
Every year, this massive[N]
volcano erupts,[A][N]
spewing ash and dusts along[N]
the center of the continent.[A][N]
Interpretations of the volcano[N]
are vast and varied-[A][N]
some see it as Opistus's[N]
wrath incarnate,[A][N]
and others see it as the[N]
earth itself crying out.[A][N]
In exchange for protection[N]
and assistance,[A][N]
Blair's group is tasked with[N]
bringing down a gang[A][N]
who have made the harsh lava[N]
fields their home.[A][X]

##ChZ1_Narration
In spite of the nation's[N]
prosperity,[A] much of Mevion[N]
is uninhabited wasteland.[A][N]
Indeed, the recesses of swamp[N]
hold little value to most.[A][N]
Yet, within the depths of[N]
Mevion, a hidden life persists.[A][N]
A young man, cast out from[N]
the eyes of the world.[A][N]
A secluded space, deep within[N]
the boundaries of the world.[A][N]
After much searching and negotiation,[N]
royal guard Hyperius,[A] one of the[N]
few who never believed Zeke dead,[A][N]
finds himself here.[A][N]
Prince Zeke... is alive.[A][X]

##ChV1_Narration
The sorrow of the commoners[N]
is often gone ignored.[A][N]
No nation can ensure life[N]
goes on smoothly,[A] and thus[N]
few even try.[A][N]
Those outside of the military[N]
hold it in very little regard,[A][N]
for their true heroes are[N]
the mercenaries of the world.[A][N]
Indeed, Ulmaron's tense politics[N]
which lead to much brigandry[A][N]
also breed lucrative mercenaries.[A][N]
Of these mercenary groups, the[N]
most beloved is without question[A][N]
the Viridian Mercenaries, named[N]
after their leader, Viridian,[A][N]
an honorable and valorous man[N]
who wishes to serve the people,[A][N]
and to spread hope for the future[A][N]
amidst the aftermath of the[N]
Elba Cor-Yg'stran War.[A][X]
