Free prisoners[N]

Fort Jraeyan: Interior[X]

##_Ch21SysText
Opening a cell will cause green[N]
units to appear,[A] who'll advance[N]
towards the nearest carpet to escape.[A][N]
They'll spawn the turn after their[N]
cell is opened, not immediately.[A][N]
Green units will be forcibly spawned[N]
in danger if you take too long.[A][N]
There will be warning one turn[N]
before each group is spawned,[A][N]
in the form of the cell's door[N]
being marked with the cursor.[A][N]
You will be rewarded for green unit[N]
survival,[A] with the best reward[N]
if every green unit survives/escapes.[A][N]
Generic green units on their own don't[N]
game over on death,[A] but if[N]
6 or more die, it's game over.[A][N]
Named green units don't cause[N]
a game over on death..[A][N]
To complete the map, open all 6 cells,[A][N]
then escape with your entire army[N]
at any carpets.[A][X]

//ending outline - after the prisoners are secured, the army returns inside to search
//scene with aercolyn knights/johan/desmond/stefan/ptolemy
//inside, eventually find experimental logs that show how long this has happened
//end with a log from girard and elcorian (perhaps THE chapter 20/V5 stuff) to reveal the twist to blair and crew
//also have more simone/arin lore

##C21LarsonBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarson]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't know you.[N]
You don't know me.[A][N]
Nothing more to say.[A][X]

##C21LarsonSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarson]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is a joke, right?[N]
A big eyeball?[A][N]
You're just an elaborate[N]
joke, right?[A][X]

##C21LarsonDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLarson]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] bad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not bad at all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C21NathanielBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
This place is my life's work![N]
Stand down, or die![A][X]

##C21NathanielJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You're one of the subjects.[A][N]
It'd be great if you could scream[N]
some empirical data as you die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Silence? That works too.[A][X]

##C21NathanielPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The first rule of this all.[N]
Distance yourself from them.[A][N]
Really, this is what you deserve[N]
for interfering with our work.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] horrible. I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] bring[N]
you down, for my friends.[A][X]

##C21NathanielSimoneBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Simone! Where in the hell[N]
have you been?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Places. Got tired of this[N]
whole gig, you know?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You won't stand in our way.[N]
You've given too much to us.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Perhaps. But I've also[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
taken so very much.[A][N]
And I think taking down this[N]
whole operation[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It'll make for a better story.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I see our years[N]
as colleagues meant nothing.[A][X]

##C21NathanielSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Surveil. I remember you.[N]
Good times.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But you seem to be[N]
against me, now.[A][N]
A shame.[A][X]

##C21NathanielDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] done nothing wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
All was for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] knowledge[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Before[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I die[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Tell me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
The breach thirteen years ago[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Was that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] your doing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] At least[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that's[N]
one mystery[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] solved[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Ch21_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There we are. Fort Jraeyan.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Smaller than I expected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think it'd be more guarded[N]
than this.[A] But it's eerily silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd call that a blessing.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
This ground looks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] burnt.[A][N]
Freshly so.[A] And I think I see[N]
some arrows sticking into that tree.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Was there a battle here?[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
Quite recently, I'd imagine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenMidRight]
Where[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are you going?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are those tents over there?[A][X]

##Ch21_Opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
Why are there abandoned tents?[N]
Whose is this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Take a look here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A ledger?[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Expenses for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Viridian[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Mercenaries[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
If you look at everything we've[N]
seen[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It all makes sense.[A][N]
Whoever's in that fortress[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] slew the mercenaries.[A][N][OpenLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unbelievable.[N]
They were[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] our trump card.[A][N]
We came here knowing full[N]
well we'd need the backuo[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And now they're gone.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Damn it![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do we do now?[N]
We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] woefully unprepared.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Why'd I think this was a good idea?[N]
That I'd be able to help?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Calm yourself. We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] got this far.[N]
That has to count for something.[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
Even so, as I asked, what[N]
are we supposed to do?[A][N]
Throw our lives away on some[N]
manner of suicidal charge?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know, it's strange that whoever[N]
did this left this tent up.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's even still got a bit of equipment[N]
in it.[A] Not like a quiver of arrows'll[N]
do us much good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Aren't these the same arrows we[N]
found outside?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What of it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] they died fighting.[A][N]
And this battle was quite recent.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I know what to do.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see what[N]
you're trying to say.[A][N]
The mercenaries took down as many of[N]
their adversaries as they could[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
So now, we strike while they're[N]
reeling from their wounds.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It might be a long shot.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's all we've got.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I think we'd better prepare.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] right. We'll find[N]
a way through this.[A][N]
Apologies for dragging you down.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm not cut[N]
out for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Stop selling yourself short.[N]
You got us this far.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'd better move. We've got[N]
to press every advantage we can.[A][X]

##Ch21_Opening3
[OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidLeft][LoadLarson][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still can't believe the boss.[N]
Why's he ending this whole operation?[A][N]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] had a good thing going.[N]
All the secrets we could want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you finished moping?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose so. Better to destroy and[N]
uncover again,[A] than to let the[N]
secrets of the world slip free.[A][N]
Speaking of destroy, I suppose it's[N]
time to clean up our subjects.[A][N]
Just gotta get-[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight]
Sir! Enemies have entered the fort![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can't be.[A][N]
The boss had all those mercs[N]
killed![A] And he's already[N]
left for Dalst again![A][N]
What in the hell is he doing?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What shall I do?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know! This isn't my wheelhouse![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll lend a hand. You're clearly hopeless.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you insist. Sortie everyone we have.[N]
Get executioners towards the cells.[A][N]
Do everything in your power to kill[N]
those who approach.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I expect[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ample compensation.[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure, sure. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go![A][X]

##Ch21_Opening4
[OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft][LoadPtolemy]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you hear something?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's probably[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry for dragging you into this.[A][N]
Spending your last days in a cell[N]
all for showing kindness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] talk like that.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hopeful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'd even bid the headsman[N]
a good day, I'm sure.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] To die here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Never[N]
again seeing Aercolyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Ch21_Opening5
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's dark in here. But I think[N]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] cells?[A][N]
No clue who they'd be keeping[N]
prisoner here,[A] but their[N]
enemy is our ally.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I ag[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]ree[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's dim[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But I can see into[N]
that cell there.[A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that outfit is unmistakable.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't follow.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone! Prepare to move out![N]
Leave no cell unopened![A][N]
Today, we liberate our proud[N]
soldiers of Aercolyn![A][X]


##Ch21_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter how many times I[N]
come up here, it's amazing.[A][N]
The whole world's down there.[A][N]
But now's hardly the time for that.[A][N]
I came up here for a clear space[N]
to think.[A] Something must be[N]
done about Sinclair.[A][N]
I know not what posessed that fool,[N]
but his shortsightedness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's going to bring an end to[N]
us all.[A] He's too dangerous to[N]
be left in his current position.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I figured I'd find you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Tarqiun. You're a lucky man.[N]
You don't have to handle this.[A][N]
Though, humor me. What would you[N]
do with Aercolyn's lord?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He threatens the law of this land.[N]
I'd strip him of everything.[A][N]
And then, send him on his way.[N]
It's harsh, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Extreme measures for the good of all.[N]
I understand your viewpoint.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe that's what we do, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What of his daughter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]She's got a life ahead to[N]
prove her worth to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've got an idea. Once I'm[N]
back in Arbordia,[A] I'll draft[N]
up a sentencing.[A][N]
This world's a changing and chaotic[N]
place. We must stand firm.[A][N]
Stand for what'll keep us thriving[N]
tomorrow.[A][X]
