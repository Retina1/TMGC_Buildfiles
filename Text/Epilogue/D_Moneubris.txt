Ulmaron we will stray.[A][N]
But I'm[...] excited and eager.[N]
To see what's beyond the shores.[A][N]
[...]And to be at your side as[N]

Time fer me t'get back[N]
to sea, lassie.[A][N]
I'm feelin' somethin' more[N]
honest than piracy.[A][N]
Maybe just a plain ol' sailor.[N]
Maybe some cargo work.[A][N]
The sea's me lifeblood, and[N]
I can't give it up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I know you'll be able to[N]
find an honest living.[A][N]

compared to Cid's boat.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]No it won't. I trust you[N]
not to let the boat burn down.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Big responsibility, there.[N]

Any specific plans in mind?[A][N][OpenRight]
Not really. There's bows to[N]

further my skills.[A][N]
Worst case, I'll see some[N]
pretty sights.[A][N]

I'm sure I'll be back one day.[N]
I'll[...] keep getting better.[A][N]
