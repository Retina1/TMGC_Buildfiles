##EBonus1
Just For You[X]

##BonusConvo1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Welcome to the bonus conversations![A][N]
I'm Retina, the guy who made the[N]
hack you're playing right now.[A][N]
[...]Or that you're watching an LP[N]
of right now.[A][N]
Anyway, this section of the event[N]
viewer is dedicated to odds and ends.[A][N]
Whether that be development trivia,[N]
highly-staged interviews,[A][N]
or just some old-fashioned shitposts.[A][N]
[...]Wait. Does saying that violate FEU's[N]
content guidelines?[A] [...]Eh. It's[N]
probably fine.[A][N]
Anyway, thanks for checking this out,[N]
and I'll see you in a future conversation.[A][N]
As I always say, goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus2
The Original Sin[X]

##BonusConvo2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The concepts in this hack go back[N]
to my high school days.[A][N]
Before I even knew what a builder was,[N]
I drafted up ideas[...] that sucked.[A][N]
Younger me thought an 80 chapter campaign[N]
with 7 acts was an acceptable length.[A][N]
[...]49 chapters is very[N]
reasonable, I swear.[A][N]
Names for a lot of characters originated[N]
either in .txt files,[A] or in a list that[N]
I typed on a graphing calculator.[A][N]
I don't get it either.[A][N]
Fast forward a few years, and as I[N]
was developing Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
these all re-emerged in my head,[N]
and were eventually placed in a ROM.[A][N]
Nothing ever happened to said ROM,[N]
since I quickly moved to buildfiles.[A][N]
Some older concepts included Hyperius[N]
and Damien as possible lords,[A][N]
Viridian and Blair's parties coming[N]
to blows,[A] and Elcorian having had[N]
a role in Mevion's revolution.[A][N]
[...]The old drafts were weird.[A][N]
Viridian's party didn't even exist in[N]
the buildfiles for quite some time.[A][N]
And some characters, like Yuyu, were[N]
spur of the moment additions,[A][N]
unlike the very carefully planned[N]
out original cast.[A][N]
If you open up the ROM in Builder,[A][N]
every unit after Elcorian's slot was[N]
conceived after development began,[A][N]
while everyone before him was planned[N]
from the very beginning.[A][N]
One last tidbit for now: instead of[N]
Kenneth and Natasia,[A] there was[N]
originally Vincent and Kenny.[A][N]
Yes, Vincent was the dark mage and[N]
Kenny was the fighter.[A][N]
Anyways, that's all for now.[N]
Thank you, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus3
Gameplay Inspirations[X]

##BonusConvo3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
I joke about my first full hack,[N]
Code of the Burger King,[A][N]
being a bootleg Souls of the Forest,[N]
but honestly, that's a misnomer.[A][N]
Trying to quantify a hack as a[N]
[OpenQuote]blank-like[CloseQuote] is reductive.[A][N]
In any case, I was inspired by fast[N]
paced player phase design,[A][N]
and sought to further polish my[N]
style in TMGC.[A][N]
My philosophy on skills was inspired[N]
by Vision Quest,[A] though they're more[N]
impactful and common here.[A][N]
Hacks like Cerulean Coast and Eternal[N]
Winter also inspired how I use skills,[A][N]
in the sense that they made me realize[N]
how absolutely insane they could get.[A][N]
Really, if you want to make a hack,[A][N]
you shouldn't worry about being[N]
like anything.[A] Experiment a bit,[N]
and find what works best for you.[A][N]
Vanilla stats, inflation, deflation[...][N]
They're all valid ways to design.[A][N]
Anyhoot, that's enough for now.[N]
Godspeed, and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonus4
Aesthetics[X]

##BonusConvo4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Aesthetics are hard to talk about,[N]
especially since I'm no artist.[A][N]
All the mugs I've made for this have[N]
been replaced,[A] or at the very least[N]
heavily polished by others (thanks Gold).[A][N]
Still, I sometimes splice things,[N]
and that's a valuable experience.[A][N]
Don't get too hung up on your hack's[N]
visual identity at first.[A][N]
If it's something people enjoy,[N]
you're bound to eventually meet people[N]
willing to help polish its look.[A][N]
That being said, I've felt creating[N]
an identity to be extremely rewarding.[A][N]
The menus are obviously a major part[N]
of that, and unfortunately,[A][N]
for many people (myself included),[N]
making menus is mind-bending.[A][N]
Luckily, our community has many[N]
people willing to help with this.[A][N]
I don't want to come off sounding[N]
like some shill,[A] but the assets[N]
I've commissioned from Scraiza are,[A][N]
without hyperbole, absolutely[N]
incredible.[A][N]
[...]I feel I've lost my[N]
train of thought here.[A][N]
Are aesthetics important, or no?[A][N]
I'd say yes, but at the end of the[N]
day, gameplay is more important.[A][N]
Well, then. Until next time.[N]
[...]Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart1
Prologue - Ch. 5[X]

##BonusConvoPart1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The start of a game can be one[N]
of the hardest things to design.[A][N]
At once you have to balance easing[N]
the player into a new world,[A][N]
introducing the context you need,[N]
and establishing WHAT your game is.[A][N]
All that considered, I think the[N]
earlygame's pretty alright.[A][N]
Some don't like earlygames with[N]
small casts, and that's alright.[A][N]
So I definitely get why some people[N]
don't like Prologue and Chapter 1,[A][N]
though for me, Chapter 1's a favorite.[A][N]
It's a challenging map that forces[N]
you to cleverly use a very small,[A][N]
very weak cast, and it forces you[N]
to prioritize what loot you want.[A][N]
[...]And then ArcherBias convinced me[N]
to make it better, so all's good.[A][N]
I don't have too much to say on 2 or 3,[A][N]
though one of my playtesters convinced[N]
me to add that Quixotic scroll.[A][N]
Chapter 4's the first map that really[N]
forces you to play somewhat fast,[A][N]
and I think I managed to get the[N]
pace feeling natural.[A][N]
Chapter 5's the first fog map.[A][N]
I actually like fog, so one of my[N]
goals was to make good fog maps.[A][N]
I know, real controversial.[N]
[OpenQuote]Make a good map.[CloseQuote][A][N]
I like little touches in 5, like the[N]
visible soldier with a killer lance,[A][N]
or the boss endangering the topmost[N]
torch on Lunatic,[A] and I think[N]
it shows that fog CAN work well.[A][N]
As for earlygame writing, it's[...][N]
alright.[A][N]
For all it's built up as, Mevion[N]
basically functions as earlygame bandits.[A][N]
Yg'stra doesn't get much yet, and[N]
Lazarus isn't particularly deep.[A][N]
But, it sets up an alright conflict,[N]
sets up Elba Cor's involvement,[A][N]
and spreads lore out in a manageable way.[A][N]
In general, I like Tellius's style of[N]
introducing countries not all at once,[A][N]
but rather as they become important.[A][N]
It feels more natural and breaks up[N]
an otherwise minutes long loredump.[A][N]
I also think the moment-to-moment[N]
character interactions are great,[A][N]
and that will hold true in general.[A][N]
I'm far better at dialogue than[N]
plotting, so[...] be warned, I guess?[A][N]
Thanks for reading,[N]
and goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart2
Ch. 5x - Ch. 10[X]

##BonusConvoPart2
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
So, interludes. Always fun to see[N]
people's reactions to them.[A][N]
Especially when they're along[N]
the lines of [OpenQuote]holy shit, i can walk![CloseQuote][A][N]
There's not a lot of traditional[N]
town maps in this hack,[A][N]
so being able to make maps that[N]
wouldn't work at ALL in real play - [A][N]
maps that were absolutely massive[N]
and a pain to navigate - [A][N]
was pretty fun.[A][N]
Plus, it's a good way to help[N]
ensure people don't forget to shop.[A][N]
Chapter 6 and 7 are two of my favorites,[N]
if only because of the music track.[A][N]
This part of the game until Chapter[N]
10's relatively relaxed,[A][N]
and there's not a huge amount in the[N]
way of new ideas introduced.[A][N]
Chapter 8 is admittedly peak filler,[A][N]
and its plot ideas should've gotten[N]
more focus than they did[...][A][N]
But[...] Uh[...][A][N]
[...]Anyway. Boat arc's cool too.[A][N]
Chapter 9 was the FEE3 showcase map[N]
in 2022, which is very funny.[A][N]
Boat map drawing people in.[A][N]
Chapter 9x was a fun twist on[N]
the established interlude formula,[A][N]
and getting more chances to write[N]
these characters is always fun.[A][N]
[...]And then you get to Chapter 10.[A][N]
Definitely a big spike in complexity,[N]
especially with the Jonas secrets.[A][N]
But I think it's a really memorable[N]
way to end this mini-arc,[A][N]
and it introduces peak fiction[N]
himself, Sveltzalus.[A][N]
What's not to love?[A][N]
[...]Anyway, that's all I have.[N]
Goodnight gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart3
Ch. 11 - Ch. 14[X]

##BonusConvoPart3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Jumping straight into a desert map,[N]
right after boat arc.[A][N]
I was really checking off all the[N]
controversial map archetypes here.[A][N]
If you're paying attention, this is[N]
the real first time you fight Holanians.[A][N]
So that's kinda fun.[A][N]
This is also the first map where I decided[N]
to break my self-imposed cast size rule,[A][N]
by going back and adding Agnes.[A][N]
Not a ton else to say here.[A][N]
Chapter 12 used to drive story people[N]
mad by having units die when killed.[A][N]
Casual mode for this map was a fairly[N]
late in development addition.[A][N]
It's also when my FE12 influence[N]
comes out in full force,[A][N]
in the form of dragons.[A][N]
Then, after a quick interlude, we're[...][N]
already taking Yg'stra?[A][N]
[...]Yeah, the Yg'stran invasion[N]
could've used an extra map.[A][N]
It's fine as is, but a little[N]
bit anticlimactic.[A][N]
Incidentally, Chapter 13's vast size is[N]
part of why I added save points.[A][N]
It also has one of the first payoffs for[N]
a minor plot beat - Desmond's horse.[A][N]
Setup and payoff's something I enjoy,[N]
even if sometimes the setups are[...][A][N]
Well, too subtle.[A][N]
Chapter 14's the end of the arc.[A][N]
I went a little hard making sure[N]
you wouldn't softlock on Lazarus,[A][N]
but I think humiliating him also[N]
feels pretty good anyway.[A][N]
Briant[...] sure exists. Definitely more[N]
just a plot device.[A][N]
I don't think characters seving little[N]
purpose beyond that is necessarily BAD,[A][N]
but I admit he's a little nothing.[A][N]
[...]Also I swear your choices[N]
really matter.[A][N]
Speaking of choices, I'll choose to[N]
spare you of more. Goodnight, gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart4
Zeke Arc[X]

##BonusConvoPart4
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
After getting comfortable, I like[N]
to shake things up a bit.[A][N]
So, here. Have a Thracia-like[N]
chain of escape maps.[A][N]
Zeke's relevance is[...] tenuous, but I[N]
liked the concept behind him.[A][N]
So, he became Lord 2.[A] Really old[N]
drafts had Hyperius as a lord,[A][N]
though he wasn't any nobility.[A][N]
Just an important guy.[A][N]
Old drafts also had Damien as important.[N]
Bit of a shame he's now just a guy.[A][N]
Chapter B was one of my favorite map[N]
concepts - [A]rivers and mountains together[N]
make for some fun terrain,[A][N]
and the gimmick's not something[N]
I've really seen before.[A][N]
Chapter Bx was the last chapter added[N]
to the outline,[A] mainly because someone[N]
suggested Zeke get room to breathe.[A][N]
Only took an afternoon to make, and I'm[N]
really happy to have it around.[A][N]
By the way, cool bug fact: technically[N]
you control Blair in that map.[A][N]
She's just reclassed to look like Zeke.[A][N]
Not a huge amount to say about the[N]
rest of the arc -[A] it's a simple and[N]
solid part of the game.[A][N]
Interlude Cx is when everything truly starts[N]
to come together,[A] especially with the[N]
existence of certain mercenaries[...][A][N]
But that's a story for another day.[N]
[...]Goodnight, gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart5
Ch. 15 - Ch. 20[X]

##BonusConvoPart5
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
The midgame, or, as I often call[N]
it internally, Holanis Arc.[A][N]
[...]Though really, it's half that[N]
and half Lowlands,[A] and it reveals[N]
one of the plot's bigger pacing issues.[A][N]
Chapter 15's neat, though.[A][N]
Big defend maps can either be super[N]
fun and memorable,[A] or a huge[N]
slog,[A] and I like to think this[N]
map leans more towards fun.[A][N]
Especially since Yuyu joins.[A][N]
Fun trivia - there was a server[N]
poll to decide her name.[A][N]
Pandora was actually on the poll[N]
and did very well,[A] but I thought[N]
that'd go better as a class name.[A][N]
Other candidates included Chanel,[A][N]
Dauterive (which was worked into[N]
her last name, Dauterivian),[A][N]
and Mina. Nifty.[A][N]
Also, I commissioned the ASM for[N]
her mechanics from Scraiza,[A][N]
by buying him a copy of Minecraft.[N]
The more you know, I guess.[A][N]
Anyway. Chapter 16's a concept that[N]
floated in my head a long time.[A][N]
A map with an ablaze town and books[N]
as a side objective stuck with me,[A][N]
and so the burning library was reworked[N]
to be the main objective of this map.[A][N]
Plus, it's timed rout, and timed rout[N]
is an awesome objective.[A][N]
After some intriguing plot hooks,[N]
it's Chapter 17 and 18 time.[A][N]
Two maps that I like the gameplay for,[N]
but that do nothing for the plot.[A][N]
They have solid character writing,[N]
but they're ultimately filler,[A][N]
in what's already a fairly short[N]
arc of the plot.[A][N]
18x was a fun experiment, taking the[N]
format of 9x and expanding it.[A][N]
There's also a certain novelty to[N]
being able to deploy everyone.[A][N]
That's just fun.[A][N]
Chapter 19 and 20 get things back[N]
on track,[A] and are two of my[N]
favorite maps.[A] Especially 20.[A][N]
I wanted to go for something unique[N]
and somewhat atmospheric,[A][N]
and decided to build on the concept[N]
of FE6 Chapter 24,[A] both in[N]
gameplay and story purpose.[A][N]
And 20's a pretty solid turning[N]
point for the plot.[A][N]
On that note, though, this part of[N]
the story got an important rewrite.[A][N]
Namely, framing the hiring of the[N]
Viridian Mercenaries around 18x,[A][N]
and making Chapter 20's events more[N]
a meaningful time diversion.[A][N]
That becomes quite relevant come[N]
a few maps later.[A][N]
Things really kick into gear after[N]
it. Well, and after the next arc.[A][N]
But that's another story.[N]
[...]Goodnight, gamers.[A][X]

##EBonusPart6
Viridian Arc[X]

##BonusConvoPart6
[OpenMidRight][LoadRetina]
Here's what you've been waiting[N]
for. Another bandit map.[A][N]
[...]Alright, Chapter I is a bit[N]
simple, but it needs to be.[A][N]
You're working with an all new[N]
cast, you need to get used to them.[A][N]
Both in gameplay and story.[A][N]
Same with Chapter II. The first part[N]
of this arc is about familiarity.[A][N]
Getting to know the Viridians, how[N]
they fight, how they interact.[A][N]
II and IIx start to drip Dalst's[N]
influence into the plot,[A][N]
obviously culminating in the events[N]
of Chapter III,[A] and the game[N]
making it clear that, yes,[A] shit's fucked.[A][N]
Chapter IV is timed rout, so it[N]
is another map without flaw.[A][N]
But none of what I'e talked about[N]
is why you're here.[A][N]
You're here for Chapter IVx and V.[A][N]
The oldest ideas for this part of[N]
the game had every mercenary die.[A][N]
However, I realized that would make[N]
it an absolute slog to replay,[A][N]
and obviously you can't just skip[N]
this part of the narrative.[A][N]
That's when the idea hit me:[A][N]
you get to choose who lives.[A][N]
It's a setup that leads to a ton of[N]
interesting and tragic interactions,[A][N]
it makes for interesting gameplay with[N]
who you send and what they bring,[A][N]
and the act of sending your units off to[N]
an unknown fate helps amplify one thing:[A][N]
the atmosphere of dread in IVx and V.[A][N]
Perhaps it's a bit forced to make[N]
Viridian act so out of it after IV.[A][N]
But this sequence is, as far as I[N]
can tell,[A] one of the game's most[N]
beloved and memoerable.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I like to think I did something right.[A][N]
[...]Goodnight, gamers.[A][X]
