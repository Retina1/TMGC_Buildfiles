[...]I still scarcely believe[N]
where mine life has come.[A][N]
Just months ago, I was one[N]
never to stray from the stage.[A][N]
And now, I've seen all the[N]
world for what it truly is.[A][N]
The exhilarating highs,[N]
the abyssal lows.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I feel much the same way.[A][N]
It's still quite hard to believe[N]
our paths crossed back in Mevion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps. But I choose to think that[N]
our meeting was an act of destiny.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Is[...] Is it wrong of me to be glad[N]
that I lived to see this day?[A][N]
When[...] When so many of my comrades[N]
met pitiable ends?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] I don't think you're wrong[N]
to be happy to be alive.[A][N]
I'd like to think they'd rather[N]
you live life as you wish,[A][N]
instead of drowning in sorrow.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] still feel the weight of[N]
the lives given for mine.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But I know that the only way to[N]
honor those lives is to move forward.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]To live on for them.[A][N]
To appreciate what their[N]
sacrifice has bought me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] truly glad that[N]
you're here now.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Reflecting upon this, I never know[N]
how much time I truly have left.[A][N]
But[...] I would like to dedicate[N]
what I have too you, milady.[A][N]
I spoke of your beauty in a pure[N]
theatrical sense,[A] but even[N]
beyond that[...][A][N]
You are truly captivating.[A][N]
I find myself simply entranced[N]
by you, Lady Blair.[A][N]
[...]Affectionate for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Have[...] Have I overspoken?[N]
Am[...] Am I being too hasty?[A][N]
I simply[...] Coming so close[N]
to meeting mine end, I[...][A][N]
I[...] do apologize.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not at all, Estelle.[A][N]
I would be more than glad[N]
to truly know you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Truly? [...]My joy is one[...][N]
hard to find words for.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It is so rare for me to not[N]
know what to say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Then just let this moment[N]
speak for itself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][OpenMidLeft]

[...]I see you're doing well[N]
for yourself, Lirel.[A][N]
Suppose that means my work[N]
is truly done.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that all this is?[N]
Some great work of yours?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I do suppose it's somewhat[N]
reductive,[A] calling a human[N]
little more than a work.[A][N]
But that is simply how those[N]
in Jraeyan see[...] Well,[A][N]
more accurately, saw things.[A][N]
How I used to. Now, though[...][N]
I've tired of that.[A][N]
Far too clinical and disconnected.[A][N]
There's a grander context that[N]
everything exists within.[A][N]
They sought to change the world,[A][N]
but they couldn't even understand[N]
it. Truly, a doomed enterprise.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You speak as if you had[N]
no involvement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Anyway. I suppose I could ask[N]
what you plan to do now.[A][N]
The world's your oyster, after all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] still not sure.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Natural. I've still not fully[N]
figured out what I want to do.[A][N]
Biographies, maybe.[A][N]
Research is all well and good,[N]
but you know what's better?[A][N]
Living. Observing. Seeing the[N]
interplay of people.[A][N]
Tracing how someone truly[N]
got to be here.[A][N]
You've got a fascinating story.[N]
Everybody here does.[A][N]
Perhaps I will take it upon[N]
myself to chronicle them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Time's a cruel and unbending force.[A][N]
I'll do what I can to fight against it.[N]
Let nothing be lost to the ages.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Good luck with that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose I've gone beyond rambling.[N]
[...]Apologies for your time, Lirel.[A][N]
Keep yourself well, and continue[N]
to impress me as I know you will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll fight for myself.[N]
Not for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]And that is all I could ever want.[A][X]

##C27_Kenneth_Stefan_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
[...]Once again, Sir Kenneth.[N]
I must[...] thank you.[A][N]
I'm truly glad we fight together[N]
on the side of righteousness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am as well. This land has many[N]
a truly mindless knight.[A][N]
Those too far up themselves to[N]
know what they fight for.[A][N]
Unquestioning. [...]Many of my[N]
father's were like that.[A][N]
[...]I can hardly stand for that[N]
manner of blind loyalty.[A][N]
But you're hardly blind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you impress me. Simple as that.[N]
I don't engage in undue flattery.[A][N]
Your heart and mind are truly[N]
impressive to me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And though you're not Lady Blair,[N]
you are more than a worthy cause.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Enough patting ourselves on[N]
the back, then.[A] It's time[N]
to show Dalst our might![A][N]
We've been with Blair since[N]
this journey's beginning,[A][N]
and today, we'll see it to[N]
its rightful conclusion![A][X]

[...]Some days, I'm truly amazed[N]
to still be alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's hardly something I'd ever[N]
expect to hear you say.[A][N]
You're a man in top condition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You don't need to flatter me.[A][N]
I'm an aged man serving an aged crown.[N]
[...]My whole life is an aged thing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That age brings experience[N]
and wisdom, sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Has that experience once served[N]
Lady Aercolyn or His Highness?[A][N]
From what I can tell, they'd be[N]
more than fine without me.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I should be proud of them.[N]
Of His Highness.[A][N]
[...]But this[...] Saddens me?[N]
Frightens me?[A] I'm[...] not so sure.[A][N]
Do[...] I still have a purpose?[A][N]
With the exception of locating and[N]
bringing the young prince home,[A][N]
has anything I've done these past[N]
twelve years mattered?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You've inspired many in Elba Cor[N]
with your unerring devotion.[A][N]
Me included.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Devotion to what? [...]I can't lie[N]
to myself.[A][OpenEyes] Those years were among[N]
Elba Cor's worst.[A] Even beyond the[N]
tragedy,[A] the land was a stagnant[N]
and dying country.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet, you believed that one day,[N]
things would get better.[A][N]
You knew the state of Elba Cor,[N]
and yet you never gave up on it.[A][N]
Never gave into despair.[A][N]
And that's[...] That's how many of[N]
us carried on.[A] And now, you've[N]
given Elba Cor a new life.[A][N]
You're truly a boon to us all, sir.[A][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]Well. Make me proud, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We will, sir.[A][X]

mind, if I may ask?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I think I do need[N]

But I think I'd rather it[N]

I[...] truly did miss ya.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Always thought you were so[N]
lucky back then.[A][N]
[...]Maybe I was just unlucky.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
'ey, the past's in the past.[A][N]
These folks 'ave shown me that[N]

But once we're done 'ere,[N]

But[...] Until then, I'll give[N]
ye a chance, brother.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
We'll do great things,[N]

Arbordia. Can't say I've[N]
ever been.[A] At least[N]
not while lucid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're not missing much.[A][N]
Some good eats here and[N]
there,[A] but it's just[N]
another city, really.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And now it's just another[N]
conquest.[A] Just the way[N]
things go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yup.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Why're you still here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why're you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey, I've told you.[A][N]
Good people died for me.[N]
Least I could do is this.[A][N]
[...]Hopefully it's what they'd[N]
want of me, anyway.[A][N]
You've got no ghosts.[N]
No closet skeletons.[A][N]
Are you miserable or no?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Neither of us are the kind[N]
to ever swear on anything.[A][N]
But I still feel some sense[N]
of duty to Viridian.[A][N]
Never thought I would.[A][N]
But you? I'm almost sure[N]
you have nothing here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I have nothing anywhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Huh.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd figure you'd understand.[A][N]
We're the same, really. Alone.[N]
Uncared for. Uncaring.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Can't even deny it.[A][N]
Well, at least I've some[N]
kind of camaraderie.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Can't say I'm not grateful.[A][X]

[...]And[...] Elcorian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] still trying to[N]
make my peace with it.[A][N]
[...]I know you had to fight[N]
one of your brothers.[A][N]
That's[...] far harder than what[N]
I have to deal with.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Even if that's true, that doesn't[N]
make this easier for you.[A][N]
Even if you think other people[N]
have it worse,[A] that[...] That[N]
doesn't make your pain matter less.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've[...] You've helped me[N]

That's the plan.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]Heh.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's got you in a good mood?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Just been thinking. Maybe this[N]
army's not so bad.[A][N]
[...]Gods. That feels wrong to say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does it, now? I think this[N]
gang's great all the time.[A][N]
[...]Feels good to be a bit of an[N]
optimist sometimes, you know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Guess so.[A] [...]Screw it. I'll take[N]
you up on that offer.[A][N]
[...]How do you feel about me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Have I ever lied to you?[N]
Why would I start now?[A][N]

No, not at all! [...]Wait.[A][N]
I mean[...] I like you too![A][N]

say than I thought.[A][N]
You sayin' it first probably[N]
helped that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Huh. Guess so. We'll see[N]
where this goes, then.[A][N]
Maybe you'll hate me once you[N]
truly know me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Maybe. Maybe I won't.[N]
Only one way to learn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, at the very least.[A][N]
