Heya, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Natasia. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been[N]
wondering something.[A][N]
Don't want to make you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
uncomfortable,[A] so if you[N]
want me to stop, tell me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What in the hell[N]
are you gonna ask?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know I like to know things.[N]
Certainty[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comforts me.[A][N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I wish to know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Did it ever[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mean anything?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we had?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I guess it did.[A][N]
It helped me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] find myself.[N]
Realize what I am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad to hear that.[N]
Let us never speak of it again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's ancient history now.[A][N]
We didn't know what we wanted,[N]
and we hardly tried to learn.[A][N]
But, hey. We're here now, beatin'[N]
up some chumps.[A][N]
So I'd say everything's coming[N]
up Natasia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wouldn't have expected this[N]
introspection out of you.[A][N]
You're right, though. All's well[N]
that ends well.[A][N]
And your current friendship's[N]
worth far more than[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
whatever you'd call that[N]
fleeting infatuation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to hear you think[N]
so highly of me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you stop, I'll whack[N]
some sense into you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Well, then. Guess[N]
I'll have to keep on my toes.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCarbon][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan][OpenMidLeft]
Heya, Stefan. Any outlandish[N]
ideas today?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Outlandish? I mean,[N]
I've got ideas.[A][N]
But they're perfectly[N]
reasonable, friend![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Like the time you suggested[N]
I get a REALLY big bow,[A][N]
and shoot swords with it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've since realized that's[N]
not the best idea.[A][N]
Lances would fly better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's wrong with some[N]
creativity?[A][N]
We're in life-or-death[N]
situations on the daily.[A][N]
Who knows when ingenuity[N]
will save the day?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't get me wrong. I like[N]
these ideas.[A] But they're[N]
all very impractical.[A][N]
And that's coming from me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps so. But I'd rather have one hundred[N]
absurd ideas than none at all.[A][N]
One of them's gotta be good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]When you put it like that,[N]
I guess it makes sense.[A][N]
Well, then. Hit me with[N]
some rapidfire.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Freezing the ground so we can[N]
slide along it faster.[A][N]
Taping together a sword, lance, and[N]
axe so we never face a bad matchup.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A spell that teleports chairs so[N]
Lady Blair can seize more easily![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keep workshopping, pal.[A][X]
