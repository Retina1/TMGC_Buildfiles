##C27GirardBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
We do this for the future[N]
of Dalst.[A] All else is but[N]
meaningless in the end.[A][N]
If you do not recognize this,[N]
you have no place among us.[A][N]
[...]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C27GirardBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
It does not bring me joy[N]
to fight one of Dalst.[A][N]
And yet, perhaps this is[N]
what your blood deserves.[A][N]
[...]Your father truly was my[N]
scourge, you know.[A][N]
Alas. That is in ages past.[A][N]
All I can do now is finally[N]
bring an end to Aercolyn.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
I told myself I would not[N]
make this personal,[A] and[N]
yet, here we are.[A][N]
Farewell, young lady.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I[...] am not my father.[A][N]
I hardly knew him.[N]
I will never know him.[A][N]
[...]This is for my people.[A][X]

##C27GirardArinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[...]Project Valkyrie.[A][N]
You were not one I knew for[N]
very long.[A] Unfortunate,[N]
really.[A] The apex of humanity.[N]
The idol of our tenacity.[A][N]
And all the more unfortunate[N]
that you must be extinguished.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I have nothing to say to you.[A][N]
We shall free the continent[N]
from your corruption.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Corruption? I - we're the only[N]
ones holding Ulmaron together.[A][N]
The only ones who know how to[N]
make the hard choices.[A][N]
The ones willing to do what[N]
must be done for our future.[A][N]
You have been given a great[N]
role in all of this,[A][N]
and for casting it aside,[N]
you shall be obliterated.[A][X]

##C27GirardKennethBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Don't try to sway me, Girard.[A][N]
You're but another obstacle in[N]
my path now.[A] I will wrest[N]
this nation from your grasp.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
I would never dream of trying.[N]
You're a stubborn young man.[A][N]
Much unlike your father.[A][N]
[...]My careful words and his[N]
unbending will to act.[A][N]
When he was alive, I - we[N]
truly had all we could want.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
[...][OpenQuote]I.[CloseQuote] That's all I[N]
needed to hear.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You're even more pathetic[N]
than I thought possible.[A][N]
Now. Begone.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
If he was a man so eager to[N]
act,[A] was it so wrong to[N]
stoke his heart?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I said begone.[A][N]
It's time your tongue[N]
be silenced forever.[A][X]

##C27GirardDesmondBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
I almost regret what I must[N]
do to you.[A] With Tarquin[N]
gone,[A] you might be the most[N]
capable general in Dalst.[A][N]
It is truly a shame to dispose[N]
of such a valuable asset.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
After what I've seen you do[N]
to my men[...][A][N]
I'd die one thousand deaths[N]
before ever serving your name.[A][N]
My lance doesn't serve Dalst.[N]
It serves Aercolyn and Blair.[A][N]
I[...] I will have my vengeance.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Very well. Let your anger[N]
guide you. Cloud you.[A][N]
See how well it serves you[N]
the rest of your short life.[A][X]

##C27GirardEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Elcorian's pupil. This is[N]
quite unfortunate.[A][N]
[...]I'm sure he'll understand.[A][N]
Besides, it is him who has[N]
shattered the barrier.[A][N]
The barrier between life[N]
and death.[A] Whatever is[N]
done to you can be undone.[A][N]
Nothing has to change between[N]
the two of you, Emile.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
I[...] will not stand for[N]
what you two have done.[A][N]
It saddens me, but if I must,[N]
I will fight Elcorian.[A][N]
[...]And if you will not let me[N]
see him,[A] I will fight you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Know that Elcorian was never[N]
insubordinate as you.[A][N]
You can ponder that in[N]
your final moments.[A][X]

##C27GirardDalstianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
You march on your own[N]
flesh and blood.[A][N]
There is nothing more that[N]
can be said.[A] There will[N]
be no absolution.[A][N]
Farewell.[A][X]

##C27GirardDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[...]It[...] cannot[...][N]
end[...] like this[...][A][N]
I must[...] take my leave.[N]
When we[...] meet again[...][A][N]
The fate of this world[...][N]
Shall be[...] decided[...][A][X]

##C27GirardKillsBlair
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I can't[...] Not like[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
You are a stepping stone[N]
to a new era of Dalst.[A][N]
Perish with dignity, and[N]
accept this honor.[A][X]

##C27GirardKillsZeke
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
The others[...] They will[...][N]
stop you[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Do not misplace your hope.[A][N]
You have already once made a[N]
mistake trusting Aercolyn.[A][N]
Now, fall for our world.[A][X]

##C27NorthWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
They're taking a straightforward approach.[N]
How bold of them.[A] [...]Alert the southern[N]
mounted division,[A] and relay a message to[N]
our northern reserves.[A][N]
We'll see how they handle a pincer attack.[A][X]
##C27NorthWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Distracting our forces to mount a direct[N]
assault? Not a bad strategy.[A][N]
Still[...] How ever will they handle[N]
our northern reserves?[A][N]
We will have to wait and see.[A][X]

##C27EastWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Taking the side entrance into the city[...][N]
Not a terrible approach at all.[A][N]
[...]Move our armored divsion in.[A][N]
Hold the invaders up while we prepare[N]
to reinforce the ramparts.[A][N]
That chokepoint will hopefully be[N]
their demise.[A][X]
##C27EastWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
A diversion while they sneak through[N]
the side entrace. Crafty.[A][N]
Still, we've ample men to reinforce the[N]
ramparts.[A] Death from afar, I say.[A][X]

##C27WestWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
The waterbound entrance. An obvious[N]
weakness for any invader to exploit.[A][N]
[...]And of course, one with an obvious[N]
solution.[A] Dispatch our flier division.[A][N]
They'll hold them off long enough for[N]
our artillery to get in position.[A][N]
And then we will show them the gravity[N]
of their understimation.[A][X]
##C27WestWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Trying to slip troops through the[N]
waterway while we're distracted?[A][N]
Not a bad gambit at all.[A][N]
[...]Artillery, prepare to make[N]
pincushions of their forces.[A][X]

##C27CenterWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Come, troops! From our doors![N]
From our streets![A][N]
The invaders have breached your[N]
walls.[A] Show them the might[N]
of Arbordia's finest![A][X]
##C27Center2Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
They're drawing close to the hall.[N]
I mustn't fail Elcorian on this day.[A][N]
My troops! It is time for our[N]
decisive and final victory![A][N]
We'll trap them near and[N]
bring them to their knees![A][X]
