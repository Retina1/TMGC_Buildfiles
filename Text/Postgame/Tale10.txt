It's me. What more could[N]
you possibly need to know?[X]
##Desc_ArinTale11
A young girl, also known as[N]
Project Valkyrie. ...Not for long.[X]
##Desc_SveltTale11
An as-yet nameless being from Surveil.[N]
It... has its charms, I suppose.[X]
##Desc_HoratioTale11
A young man from Myrmidon.[N]
...It's not his time to leave.[X]
##Desc_NathanielTale11
I'd call him a walking historical footnote.[N]
...He wishes he mattered that much.[X]

##Tale10Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone]
Too easy.[A][N]
[...]Surveil and Valkyrie.[N]
Two in one day.[A][N]
Of course, I'm only halfway[N]
done here.[A][N]
You and I shall be taking[N]
quite a walk, child.[A][N]
Unlike Surveil, I can't just[N]
leave you to the world yet.[A][N]
[...]Can't bring you home, though.[A][N]
After all, you can't change[N]
the world from Holanis.[A][N]
Luckily for this, I've a[N]
friend in Dalst.[A][N]
You'll get plenty nurture.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]You'll prosper. Not in there.[N]
But in the actual world.[A][N]
Not some facsimile dreamed by[N]
the delusional.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]Onward. Your life is[N]
about to begin, Valkyrie.[A][N]
[...]Lirel.[A][X]

##Tale10HoratioDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Blast[...] I was[...][N]
so close[...][A][CloseEyes][X]
##Tale10SimoneDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Damn[...] it[...][A][N]
Valkyrie[...] Prove[N]
yourself[...] to them[...][A][CloseEyes][X]
##Tale10AlarmRaised
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2]
What in the[...] I've been[N]
hit! Someone, anyone![A][N]
Raise the alarm![A][N][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Ah. That'll be a problem.[A][X]
##Tale10AlarmRaisedNathan
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Who was that? Guards![N]
Situation brewing![A][N]
Raise the alarm![A][N][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Ah. That'll be a problem.[A][X]

##Tale10_SimoneTattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone][OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel]
Simone? What brings you[N]
here? Something happen?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. That Myrmidon child[N]
accosted me in the hall.[A][N]
He should be nearby.[N]
Have the guards recapture him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
An escape? Very well.[N]
Guards! Surround the Myrmidon![A][N]
Don't let him escape![A][N][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadHoratio]
Wha-[A] Did you not say you'd[N]
help me escape?[A] Did that[N]
mean nothing?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Patience.[A] There's been[N]
a change of plans.[A][N]
[...]Farewell.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You[...] You traitor![A][X]

##Tale10_HoratioCaught
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHoratio][OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel]
[...]You. What are you doing[N]
outside of your cell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm escaping, dastard![A][N]
I'll cut right through[N]
you if I've gotta![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadSimone]
You will do no such thing.[A][N]
Nathaniel, I found this one in[N]
the halls, and he accosted me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And you've just been letting him[N]
run circles around you?[A][N]
[...]Well, he's a Myrmidon.[N]
So that's[...] understandable.[A][N]
[...]Guards! Recapture the Myrmidon![A][N][OpenLeft]
Wha-[A] Did you not say you'd[N]
help me escape?[A] Did that[N]
mean nothing?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I said nothing of the sort.[A][N]
[...]Farewell.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You[...] You traitor![A][X]

##Tale10_SimoneWantsToTakeAWalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] well and truly sorry.[A][N]
I swear I had sealed off all[N]
the cells, but I guess[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's done is done.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're dismissed for the night.[N]
Get some rest, Simone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, Nathan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][CloseEyes]Sure.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Splendid.[A][X]

##Tale10_HoratioJoins
[OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Providence! Mine cell was[N]
left ajar![A][N]
Freedom shall come for me![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone]
Silence, foolish boy.[A][N]
I was the one who did that.[N]
And you can't escape yet.[A][N]
Discretion is key.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, but of course.[A][N]
Can't alert the nightwatch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Exactly.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove](The bait is set.[N]
[...]Apologies, Myrmidon.)[A][X]

##Tale10_ArinRecruitment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone][MoveMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]*Knock!*[ToggleMouthMove][N]
[...]Greetings.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you feeling shy, perhaps?[A][N]
Worry not. Tonight'll be[N]
something of an[...] exodus.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Take the blade from your desk.[N]
Use it to come to me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][X]
##Tale10_SystemText1
Escape the cell.[A][X]

##Tale10_ArinOut
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
Very good. Now. Fall asleep.[N]
I shall carry you out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I believe another friend of[N]
ours is making their entrance.[A][X]
##Tale10_SystemText2
Do not drop Arin under[N]
any circumstances.[A][X]

##Tale10_ArinDrop
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]What the hell, me?[A][N]
Why would I retell me[N]
screwing this up?[A][N]
Damn it. [...]From the[N]
top, then. Correctly.[A][X]

##Tale10_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel]
Ah, Simone. Just who I[N]
wished to see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you're the exact[N]
opposite of that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why so deadly a mood?[N]
[...]You've done adequate.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks.[A] [...]Wait. I'm[N]
above you here.[A][N]
I should be talking of YOUR[N]
adequacy, Georgios.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Grow a spine, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very funny. Anyway, we're[N]
on night watch.[A][N]
There's been alerts of someone[N]
with designs on the Valkyrie.[A][N]
Might be a false alarm, but to be[N]
safe, we're on high security.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So we are.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, yeah. Big pain. I know.[A][N]
Look. If you help here, I'll[N]
put in a good word.[A][N]
Requisitions'll get you some[N]
nice[...] paper, or something.[A][N]
I'll take my post in the grand[N]
hall.[A] You can patrol the[N]
Valkyrie's ward.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure. If there's any danger,[N]
start screaming.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As a signal? That seems[N]
quite inefficient.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No. I just want to hear[N]
you scream.[A] Cathartic.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sure.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Brainless mongrel.[A][N]
Now. There is still much to prepare.[N]
But let it be known.[A][N]
In one night, I shall change Ulmaron[N]
far more than any here ever have.[A][X]

##Tale10_Opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Hm. Security's real good.[A][N]
Doors're sealed.[A] And Nathaniel's[N]
got the only way to unlock 'em.[A][N]
Good news, then. I don't care.[A][N]
If I can get her attention from[N]
out here, that issue's solved.[A][N]
A step forward, a brief knock[...][N]
That'll do it.[A][X]
