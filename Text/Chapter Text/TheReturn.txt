This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This might be wrong of me to say,[N]
but you two are family to me too.[A][N]
We've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been through hell together.[N]
And that's nothing of the ones lost.[A][N]
But on my life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You two will[N]
survive. You must.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right back at you, Dean.[N]
You're not dying on us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll make it out of here, and then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, you can introduce us to your kids![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I like the sound of that.[N]
But first, the battle awaits.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Isn't it obvious? We have to[N]
help them! It's our duty![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As mercenaries?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As people, brother![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was just a trick question.[N]
We've a job, and they paid.[A][N]
Eyes up, both of you.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No time for doubts now.[N]
Stay close to me, sister.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I can handle myself.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If we're done here, then let[N]
us proceed onwards.[A][N][CloseEyes]

Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
So, what now? We charge?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
That's dangerous, brother.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We must.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Never expected you to say that, Eliza.[N]
Guess something's rubbed off on you.[A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can't afford to[N]
be afraid, now.[A][N][OpenRight]
She's right. It's do-or-die. And, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, let's make them mean something.[A][N]

we do their job. That's the way it goes.[A][N][OpenRight]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it.[A][OpenEyes] You're right.[N]
Besides[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thinking about it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We saw that girl, too. On the streets[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe there's more than luck[N]
to our encounters with her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

are you going to do your duty?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't believe I've gotta be[N]
the serious one now.[A][N][OpenRight]
Apologies, Wilhelm. I'll show the world[N]
my true skills.[A][CloseEyes] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For Viridian.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
