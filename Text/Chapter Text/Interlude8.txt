##I8SendOff
Send this unit to scout?[N]
[No][X]
##I8SysText
Decide on exactly three units[N]
to send ahead to scout.[A][N]
Viridian and Chartreuse[N]
cannot be among them.[A][N]
These units will not see Viridian[N]
again for a long time,[A] so make[N]
your decision carefully.[A][X]

##I8Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've formulated a plan.[A][N]
Three of us shall move ahead[N]
to scout,[A] while the remaining[N]
ten shall take this position.[A][N]
The scout team will report to us[N]
at this marked location,[A][N]
once the lady's party has[N]
reached our meetup spot.[A][N]
Does this seem reasonable?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Viridian?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right! It's all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you sure? You seem like you've[N]
been out of it for a few days.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What if[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this is all a mistake?[N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] saw myself in a dream.[A][N]
Something within me said we'd[N]
all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] die here.[A][N]
That nagging fear sometimes[N]
strikes, but this time[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] genuine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] see. Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you sure[N]
you want to do this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to. Not just because[N]
of this mystery,[A] but because[N]
we swore to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It wouldn't be right to not[N]
tell the others of my fears.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadRift]
You hardly need to tell[N]
us a thing, boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
We'll stick by you until the end.[N]
Wouldn't be right for us to run.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadManfred]
Indeed. We speak for everyone[N]
outside of this tent.[A][N]
We know this is a dangerous[N]
job, but we're all ready for it.[A][N]
We knew what this life would[N]
bring,[A] and are willing to risk[N]
it to stand together.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] appreciate it, all.[N]
This still feels very wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
But we must walk our chosen paths.[A][N]
You said three, correct?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That I did. Once you've made[N]
your choice,[A] we'll begin[N]
our final preparations.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So this is it.[A][N]
Our scouts may face risk beyond[N]
comprehension.[A] Three soldiers[N]
alone would stand no chance.[A][N]
Even so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Going without a forward squad[N]
could guarantee all of our deaths.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who lives? Who dies?[N]
It's all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] in my hands.[A][X]

##I8Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is it.[N]
The scouts[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have left.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone. It's time[N]
to set our position.[A][N]
These coming days will decide[N]
our fate.[A] Even so, we will[N]
never back down.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards![A][X]

##I8ChartreuseTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadChartreuse]
I know this has been a long[N]
and exhausting journey.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're behind you, Viridian.[A][N]
I'm behind you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thank you. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Do you deserve this?[A][N]
Risking your life for us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not about deserving. It's about[N]
me choosing to fight with you.[A][N]
You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] saved me. It'd be[N]
wrong to not return the favor.[A][N]
No matter what, I'll stay at[N]
your side.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sure you've[N]
heard that a lot, lately.[A][N]
But you deserve to hear it.[A][X]

##SendFreddricYes
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't be. I'm sure we'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
meet again.[A][N]
I'd better[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be off.[N]
To prepare.[A][X]
##SendFreddricNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've still time to decide.[N]
I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this isn't easy.[A][N]
But whatever you decide,[N]
we're here to the end.[A][X]
##I8FreddricTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know the mood's harsh here,[N]
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I just wanted to thank[N]
you. For everything.[A][N]
While we still have the chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, Freddric.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] There's no reason to[N]
act like this'll be the end.[A][N]
It[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can't be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right.[A][X]

impossible choice.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks fer everythin'.[A][X]
##SendDeanNo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadDean][OpenMidLeft]

##I8DeanTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadDean]
I know my family knows I[N]
might not come back[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sad, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] they're[N]
prepared for that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry. I won't leave ya'.[N]
I don't fight just for myself.[A][N]

feel bad about this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's how[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it has to be.[A][X]
##I8ElizaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been useful, right?[A][N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all I've wanted.[N]
To help others.[A][N]
That's all both of us have ever wanted.[A][N]
Spreading something happy throughout[N]
this disheartening world.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It will be the performance of[N]
a lifetime.[A] And perhaps I shall[N]
surpass our expectations.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let the tale of Estelle echo[N]

breathe new life into the stage.[A][N]
That thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] makes this worth it.[A][N]

Living on the run[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm used to it.[A][N]

##I8CallumTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I just wanted to thank you.[N]
Nothing more, nothing less.[A][N]
You're a competent leader, and[N]
you understand your soldiers.[A][N]
I can respect that, especially[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]At least you're honest about it.[A][N]
Elba Cor would try to sugarcoat[N]
a deathmarch like this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's been a pleasure.[A][X]
##SendWilhelmNo

From gambler, to soldier, to mercenary[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You know what's weirder?[A][N]
I know our client. She was in[N]

It's remarkable, how beautiful this[N]
once-barren land has become.[A][N]
I know little of Holanis's past,[N]
but I am certain it has a future.[A][N]
In the end, that's what we fight[N]
for, is it not?[A] The futures[N]
of all of our lands?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, today is also[N]
of grave importance.[A][X]
