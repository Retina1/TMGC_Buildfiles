You still haven't answered[N]
my questions.[A][N]
I'm almost offended. But it's[N]
alright. They're quite nontrivial.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I prefer to avoid sacrifice.[A][N]
Especially when it comes to the[N]
lives of others.[A] It's not my[N]
choice to make.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Moral, I see. Not a surprise.[N]
They didn't get in your head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]They?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The ones at Jraeyan. They'll justify[N]
anything.[A] I should know. I was[N]
one of them.[A][N]
Maybe I still am at heart.[A][N]
[...]Do you trust me not to bring you all[N]
to ruin for the sake of some future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] can't say for certain.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That's why I like you, kid.[N]
You're not blind or ignorant.[A][N]
Maybe once this is done, we can[N]
co-author a paper.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Or has meeting your hero gone[N]
and backfired hard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll admit you're[...] different[N]
than in your dissertations.[A][N]
But I can tell we're both[N]
passionate for our craft.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Craft? For me, tearing into the[N]
world isn't a mere craft.[A][N]
It's a way of life. A state[N]
of being.[A] It is me.[A][N]
And I've learned much about[N]
you from our talks.[A][N]
You're an interesting man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] glad?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You should be.[A][X]

[...]I could swear we had more[N]
rations just yesterday[...][A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Our supply in general feels[N]
disorganized, lately[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadIan]
Hello, miss![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Gah![A][N][ClearFace][LoadBlair]
[...]A child? What[...] What[N]
are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Ian![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see. What are you[N]
doing here?[A][N]
Where are your parents?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I live by a big river![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Big river[...]? Don't tell me[...][N]
Do you mean in Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah! I saw dragons in[N]
the river![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]You've been with us since[N]
the Great Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I'd ask how you got along[N]
this far,[A] but I don't think[N]
that'll help anyone.[A][N]
We're getting you home as[N]
soon as we're done here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been playing around in[N]
these tents.[A] You have so[N]
many tasty snacks![A][N]
And so many cool swords![A][N][MoveMidRight]
Whoosh! Whoosh![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Please stay back.[A][N]
Don't come out on the[N]
field with us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But you guys look so cool[N]
fighting out there![A][N]
I wanna join![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's too dangerous for you.[N]
Please. Just hide here.[A][N]
We'll help you later, Ian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]I know I can fight![A][N]
[...]Maybe they'll accidentally[N]
let me onto the battlefield.[A][N]
And then they'll see that I'm[N]
a kid to fear![A][X]

Greetings, lassie! Glad to[N]
see you made it this far.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hello there. What's this[N]
outfit supposed to be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No clue. Anna told me that someone[N]
would probably find it funny.[A][N]
But that's not what I'm here[N]
to discuss.[A] It's time for[N]
another patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's in a very fort-uitous[N]
location![A] Good luck gettin' to[N]
it without some help from a flier.[A][N]
Course, there's a lot of fortuitous[N]
places that you can't walk to[...][A][N]
So I guess you'll have to check[N]
them all![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's barely even a hint![A][N]
[...]I'm truly amazed you've had[N]
any customers besides us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My girlie truly treads the road to ruin.[N]
Financial ruin, that is.[A][N]
But she always comes out ahead. So I[N]
gotta just trust her instincts.[A][N]
Anyhoot, I'll see ya! Good luck[N]
reclaiming your home, and all that![A][X]
