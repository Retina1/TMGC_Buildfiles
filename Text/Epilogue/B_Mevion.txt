[OpenFarLeft][LoadButch][OpenLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
What about the two of you?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Butch 'ere was thinkin' about[N]
hanging up his sword a while.[A][N]
Can't blame him. I wouldn't[N]
mind a break, myself.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're a thrifty and rich man.[N]
You hardly need this work.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I guess. Still. It'd get boring[N]
lazing around back here.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Suppose so.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Then again, you're here.[N]
Wouldn't be all too bad.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Not that I'd be completely[N]
against it, eventually.[A][N]
But I think after what we've[N]
been through,[A] we deserve[N]
at least a while to ourselves.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, then. [...]Let us know if[N]
you need a job done, lass.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing. On that note,[N]
about your payment[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Keep it. I hardly need it.[N]
This war's been[...] fruitful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright, then.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's been a hell[N]
of a time.[A][N]
Stay well, lass.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
You sure I'd fit in here, old man?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Everyone fits in here.[N]
You're nothin' special.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]You know what I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So you two are staying here?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Yup. The old man's convinced he[N]
can keep me out of trouble.[A][N]
Thinks he can drag me into the[N]
restaurant business.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Old friends gotta look out[N]
for each other.[A][N]
Besides, this beats servin'[N]
the church, right?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That remains to be seen.[A][N]
[...]Guess a change of pace[N]
won't hurt.[A] Even if only[N]
for a while.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Restaurant business, you say?[A][N]
Well, I'll be sure to stop by[N]
whenever I return here.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Would be our pleasure, lass.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
If you don't return, we'll[N]
come and find you.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Stay safe![A][X]

##Epilogue_PeggyMevion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I'd better get back to[N]
the ol' church.[A][N]
They're probably all wonderin'[N]
where I went.[A] [...]Maybe they[N]
like the peace and quiet.[A][N]
Maybe I'll like it for once.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I still struggle to think where[N]
we'd be without you, Peggy.[A][N]
Thanks for all you've done.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't sweat it. It was a[N]
good time. Mostly.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Nothing will ever match it.[N]
[...]Now you've got me nostalgic.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, the world's big. There's[N]
many adventures to have.[A][N]
Knowin' me, I'll be up and at it[N]
again in a few months, tops.[A][N]
Maybe I'll run into you again.[N]
If not, though[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
Again. It's been fun.[A][X]

##Epilogue_PeggyMevionAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Gonna stick around with those[N]
two, I think.[A] Butch'll need[N]
someone to keep 'im focused.[A][N]
And Peter's a swell one too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Glad to hear you've got some[N]
good friends here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. And it's thanks to stickin'[N]
with you that we reconnected.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Thanks for that, Blair.[A][OpenMidRight]
You're[...] welcome?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd better be.[A] Well, you don't[N]
need to worry for lil' ol' me.[A][N]
Won't be bored for ages.[A][N]
And if I ever do, I can just make[N]
some ruckus in your countryside.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I look forward to it.[A][X]

##Epilogue_RiftEstelleMevion
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRift][OpenLeft][LoadEstelle][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I didn't picture the two of[N]
you returning together.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Rift here has much to teach,[N]
and many stories to tell.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I get to show bright-eyed actors[N]
swordfighting techniques.[A][N]
And I don't have to risk my[N]
life on the daily for money.[A][N]
I'd say I've won here.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You are hardly just a coach.[A][N]
You shall become an actor worthy[N]
of the finest accolades.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] don't think I'll be[N]
quite that good.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Nonsense. You've the soul[N]
of an artist within you.[A][N]
Let the stage become your[N]
canvas, and you your palette![A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]You see, milady. One day[N]
I'll understand that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm. I'd say I already[N]
understand it.[A][N]
Well put, Estelle.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I knew a kindred spirit as[N]
yourself would grasp it.[A][N]
If you ever find yourself[N]
here again,[A] I implore[N]
you to come see us.[A][N]
[...]Until we meet again.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JeffButchMevion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Never thought I'd show up[N]
back here again.[A][N]
But I[...] I'll be better.[N]
I know I can.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've done great things for[N]
us, Jeff.[A] I'm sure you'll[N]
do great things here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
One can hope.[A][N]
Butch was talkin' about[N]
setting me up with a gig.[A][N]
An honest gig, I mean.[A][N]
Maybe it'll work out.[N]
Maybe it won't.[A][N]
I owe it to him to try[N]
and make amends.[A][N]
[...]I think that counts for[N]
something.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Off, then. Don't need to[N]
get any sappier around ya.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JeffMevion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Never thought I'd show up[N]
back here again.[A][N]
But I[...] I'll be better.[N]
I know I can.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've done great things for[N]
us, Jeff.[A] I'm sure you'll[N]
do great things here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
One can hope.[A][N]
My old man's some kinda[N]
political star.[A][N]
Gonna see if there's[N]
work he needs done.[A][N]
Can't undo what I've[N]
done,[A] but I can try[N]
and make amends.[A][N]
I think that counts for[N]
something.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Off, then. Don't need to[N]
get any sappier around ya.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ButchMevion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Hm. Still feels odd to me.[N]
It's all just[...] over.[A][N]
And that might've been my[N]
last battle ever.[A][N]
[...]I'm done fightin' until[N]
I die.[A] It was a life, sure.[N]
But I'll take a new one.[A][N]
Think I'm gonna take a[N]
job with my brother.[A][N]
Runs a restaurant here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to hear.[N]
Enjoy your retirement.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure will, milady.[A][N]
Thanks for givin' me one[N]
more chance to fight.[A][N]
If you're ever in Mevion[N]
in the future,[A] come by[N]
the Forsaken Shortsword.[A][N]
I'll treat you to a free[N]
meal. Then we'll be even.[A][X]

##Epilogue_PeterMevion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's finally payday.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. You've served[N]
us very well, Peter.[A][N]
Once we sort Dalst's treasury,[N]
you'll get all you want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Wait, really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did you think I'd lie?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No. 'Course not. Just still[N]
manages to surprise me.[A][N]
[...]Keep your money, lass.[A][N]
I got more than I could[N]
ever really need.[A][N]
It'd be gauche to take more.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Are you certain?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. [...]If anyone asks, you[N]
gave me half a million.[A][N]
I've still got a reputation[N]
to think about, after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're a good lass.[N]
Stay that way.[A][X]
