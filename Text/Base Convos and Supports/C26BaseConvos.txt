Hm[...] I'd like to think we're[N]
prepared for today[...][A][N]
But I can't help feeling like[N]
I'm forgetting something.[A][N]
[...]It's probably nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Blair. Are you busy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just making final preparations.[N]
I can make time if you need me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. There is[...] much[N]
we wish to speak about.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We?[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
Salutations, milady.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadNatasia]
Heya, Blair![A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
Good to see you well.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadYuyu]
It's me![A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Five of my dearest friends[N]
wish to speak to me at once?[A][N]
What[...] What's the occasion?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's a narrative, long and winding.[A][N]
Shall I guide you down its road?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Why'd we let Stelle[N]
give the preamble?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ahem. Our story begins upon our[N]
arrival in Aercolyn.[A][N]
After our conversation on[N]
the Dalstian plains,[A] I had[N]
found myself[...] overcome.[A][N]
Of course, mine emotions are not[N]
those which are easily masked.[A][N][OpenRight]
I happened upon her gazing[N]
wistfully at a tree.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Our lovely Avan caught me deep[N]
in thoughts most longing.[A][N]
Thoughts of longing for thine[N]
embrace most tender.[A][N][OpenRight]
There's hardly a need to be that[N]
dramatic.[A] Anyway, we had obviously[N]
known each other beforehand,[A][N]
but the two of us truly[...] hit[N]
it off. More than that, perhaps.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Like that? I'm happy for[N]
the two of you, then.[A][N]
[...]I also feel that wasn't[N]
your entire point.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
At the same time, I began[N]
speaking to Arin here.[A][N]
[...]She's nifty.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadArin]
[...]Nifty?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Nifty is quite the lovely word, Arin.[A][N]
[...]In any case, as I've spent time among[N]
this merry band, I realized something.[A][N]
The limits to our happiness are those[N]
we impose on ourselves.[A] And for what?[A][N]
There is much in this world that I have[N]
found myself growing to hold dear.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadNatasia]
She'd brought us together over[N]
our time in Aercolyn,[A][N]
and told us of her thoughts.[A][N]
It's definitely unfamiliar,[N]
but it feels[...] right.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I suppose this brings us to[N]
where we now find ourselves.[A][N]
Five of us of varying relations[N]
with each other,[A] tied together[N]
by a certain fondness for you.[A][X]

##C26GirlkissingPart2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNatasia][OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenLeft]
I[...] I think I see what[N]
you're trying to say.[A][N]
I've[...] hardly ever been in any[N]
relationship.[A] Let alone several.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But if you all trust me[...][N]
Then I trust all of you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]We are truly glad to hear.[A][N]
I know this may be a lot to[N]
understand at this moment.[A][N]
We are not all equal in our[...][N]
infatuations among each other.[A][N]
But we still aim to grow all the[N]
closer as the days pass.[A][N]
[...]What I do know is our shared[N]
affection for you, Blair.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Who could blame us, really?[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadYuyu]
Gettin' to know and love[N]
five people in and out[...][A][N]
[...]I count us all very lucky.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
Truly. Providence has brought us[N]
together,[A] and given us a chance[N]
to be truly as one.[A][N][OpenRight]
We'll all be here for each other.[N]
[...]For you, Blair. And for us.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Then I shall be here for[N]
all of you.[A] We'll win this[N]
war together,[A] and then we can[N]
truly learn what we are. Together.[A][X]


##C26_Natasia_Peggy_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]
You doin' well with that[N]
healin' stuff, Nat?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I sure hope so! What about[N]
those axe totin' muscles, Peg?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not too shabby, if I do say so.[A][N]
[...]Wait. Peg?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You called me Nat. Thought[N]
I'd return the favor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh. Peg. I like it.[A][N]
It's simple and to the point.[A][N]
Most people back in Mevion don't[N]
bother with nicknames.[A][N]
I'm either just Peggy or[N]
some variant of lass.[A][N]
[...]Then again, guess Peggy's[N]
also a nickname.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I trust you not to spill[N]
this, Nat,[A] but my name's[N]
actually Margaret.[A][N]
[...]So help me, if you spread[N]
that 'round the army,[A][N]
I'll find a way to undo all[N]
the healing I've given you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hardly think it's that[N]
big of a deal, really.[A][N]
But don't worry. If you want it[N]
kept secret, it'll be secret.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Appreciate it.[A][N]
[...]Relax, Nat. I wouldn't actually[N]
beat you within an inch of your life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! Glad we're clear on[N]
both sides, then.[A][N]
[...]If you're that worried,[N]
why would you tell me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As I said. I trust you.[A][N]
You're a good friend now.[N]
You've earned a secret.[A][N]
[...]Do I get one in return?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hm[...] I'll think on it.[A][N]
Have to make sure it's as[N]
earth-shattering as your name.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] True. You'll have one[N]
hell of a time topping that.[A][N]
But you're a smart kid.[N]
You'll figure something out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure I will, Peg.[A][X]

##C26_Stefan_Carbon_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
You ready for this?[A][N]
Can't imagine fighting[N]
your homeland's easy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Didn't you fight Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's[...] different.[A][N]
I always knew they were[N]
in the wrong with the war.[A][N]
But you've[...] Well, you've[N]
been betrayed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I won't say it doesn't[N]
hurt to think about.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But getting trapped in those[N]
thoughts does me no good.[A][N]
Out on the battlefield[...][N]
They're an enemy of justice.[A][N]
Nothing more.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I guess I also had to[N]
think like that.[A][N]
Nothing to be proud of,[N]
but nothing to do about it.[A][N]
[...]Let's get back to something[N]
a bit lighter.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Any new brilliant ideas?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Hm[...][A][ToggleSmile] Ballistas that launch[N]
other ballistas.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Brilliant.[A][X]

##C26_Butch_Peter_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Whew[...] You ever gonna[N]
retire from this, bud?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not as long as I can keep[N]
makin' a killing.[A][N]
I quite like money a lot.[N]
Better than not, I say.[A][N]
And I'm damn good at finding[N]
myself with lots of it.[A][N]
Maybe one day I'll have myself[N]
some cushy retirement fund.[A][N]
But then again, Darahan 'ere[N]
eats like a monarch.[A][N]
Wyverns ain't cheap.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Guess so. All I need're[N]
leather scraps and a blade.[A][N]
[...]Haven't thought about that[N]
whole savin' thing, though.[A][N]
So who knows. I may be further[N]
from peace than you'll ever be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worst case, you got a brother[N]
with a cushy business.[A][N]
Me, though? I'm my only cushion.[N]
Gotta keep on keepin' on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know I'd let a bud like[N]
you stay with me if you gotta.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be fine. But thanks, pal.[N]
[...]Onto the field, then.[A][N]
Gotta work for our retirement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Course. I can still show[N]
'em all we mean business.[A][X]

##C26_Yuyu_Hollandaise_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYuyu][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
[...]What's yer game, Yuyu?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I enjoy checkers.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ye know what I mean.[N]
Why're ye cozyin' up to me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Guh? I'm just a silly[N]
creature, Holly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Where I'm from, Yuyu,[N]
nothin' like that is free.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. Well, we're not in[N]
the Lowlands anymore.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
My antics are one hundred[N]
percent free of charge.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You[...] You can trust me.[A][N]
I've[...] been alone before.[N]
I don't want you to feel like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...][A][CloseEyes] I appreciate it.[N]
I do.[A] [...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've got an idea.[N]
Let's crush some bastards.[A][N]
That'll brighten your spirits.[N]
[...]Or maybe just mine.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Always up for some crushin'.[A][N]
Sorry for gettin' a bit out[N]
there, Yuyu.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
All good, Holly. Just tryin'[N]
to keep our spirits up.[A][N]
If you ever need something,[N]
look for me.[A][N]
[...]Or for two identical copies[N]
of the same person.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Duly noted.[A][X]

##C26_Jeff_Hilbert_Base

Mister! Where[...][N]
Where's your mask?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That old thing? I[...][N]
I won't be needin' that.[A][N]
[...]Never been a sentiment guy,[N]
but[...] You've done good, kid.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Wantin' to be a hero,[N]
saving people.[A][N]
You're[...] You're already[N]
an expert, kid.[A][N][OpenEyes]
And now[...] I want to try[N]
givin' some good back.[A][N]
[...]Thanks for everything, hero.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Good luck, Mister Jeff.[A][X]

##C26_Horatio_Simone_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSimone][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio][OpenMidLeft]
I see you've recovered your sword.[A][N]
[...]And I'm certain you didn't have the[N]
time to go for a swim in the Lowlands.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The storge betwixt [Tact] and I can[N]
shatter any of your illusions, witch.[A][N]
And now, [Tact] shall end you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Now, why ever would you do that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I will not fall for any[N]
of your ruses, Georgios![A][N]
You think to distract me[N]
with a poisoned tongue?[A][N]
Fine, then. Keep to your[N]
unending trail of false hopes.[A][N]
Let them comfort you as [Tact][N]
delivers you unto oblivion![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Well.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Don't give me that look![N]
[...]Why[...] are you like this?[A][N]
Why does [Tact] waver?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Simple.[A][OpenEyes] You don't want[N]
to actually kill me.[A][N]
Can't say I don't appreciate it.[A][N]
[...]Look at it this way. Sure,[N]
I might've deceived you.[A][N]
But it awoke in you a new power.[N]
Ends justify means, and all that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Do those ends justify those[N]
long years, witch?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A]Can't say they do.[N]
Too late for you, though.[A][N]
Live with it, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][Tact]. Let us be off.[A][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

Apollo![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you need of me, Bechamel?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I just wanted a bit o'[N]
a word wit' ya, bud.[A][N]
[...]Since it's a big fight comin'[N]
up, I wanted ta thank ye.[A][N]
While we have the chance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Everythin'! Ye've been nothin' but[N]
kind, and ye've taught me so much.[A][N]
Were not for you, I'd be at[N]
the bottom o' the sea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] just the least I could do.[A][N]
And you've brought new experiences into[N]
my life as well.[A] Experiences that I[N]
would not trade for anything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd[...] like ta have some more.[A][N]
Experiences and memories, I mean.[A][N]
[...]With you.[A] Maybe even as[N]
more than just mateys.[A][N]
Ye've given me life a purpose. And I[N]
think I'd like to spend it wit' ye.[A][N]
If ye'd have me, that is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] I'd like that very much.[A][N]
I will give you all that I have.[N]
[...]All that I am. I promise.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I shall too.[A][N]
[...]This be better than any[N]
treasure I've known.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]A bit on the nose, there.[N]
But I'm truly happy you think that.[A][X]
