[...]It's quite nice here.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
That it is. There's a reason[N]
I'm proud of Aercolyn.[A][N]
And you're now another one[N]
among those reasons.[A][N]
Your skills will do wonders[N]
for the men of Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm[...] glad to hear.[N]
And to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you'll be training our knights,[N]
we can all rest that much sounder.[A][N]
I'm glad to have you, Flynn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You[...] flatter me, milady.[A][N]
But I shall do my best[N]
to share my passion.[A][N][OpenRight]
You're shown me much already.[A][N]
I have faith that you'll be able[N]
to inspire all of Aercolyn.[A][N]
[...]Take care, Lady Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_DesmondAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
[...]Our work has truly just begun,[N]
Lady Blair.[A] The war's over, but[N]
that isn't enough for true peace.[A][N]
[...]Daunting as the path ahead may[N]
truly be,[A] I like to think that[N]
I am capable of pursuing it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You are, Sir Desmond. You're half[N]
the reason we ever got this far.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps that's overselling me[N]
a little.[A] But I do appreciate[N]
the faith you hold all the same.[A][N]
And I shall do all that I can to[N]
ensure it is a faith not misplaced.[A]
[...]Aercolyn shall be the best that[N]
I can make it. I swear it.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ToddsworthAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth]
[...]Weird question. Mind if I[N]
stay here a while?[A][N]
[...]Not here as in this castle.[N]
But here as in the city.[A][N]
I think I could make something[N]
of a name for myself here.[A][N]
[...]That guy who helped your lady[N]
save all your lives.[A][N]
Something like that.[N]
[...]You like that idea?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] hardly need permission[N]
to live here, Toddsworth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wait, really?[A] [...]Now I feel[N]
stupid for asking.[A][N]
In that case, I'll find the[N]
nearest abandoned house,[A][N]
and unpack everything I own.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Buh-bye![A][X]

##Epilogue_StefanAercolyn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
To think of the highs and the[N]
lows this journey's brought[...][A][N]
I'm[...] truly grateful to have[N]
fought for you, Lady Blair.[A][N]
And until the day I fall, I'll[N]
remain at your beck and call![A][N]
[...]Didn't even mean for it to[N]
sound so poetic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ha. You've already done more[N]
than your share for Aercolyn.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I know encouraging you to[N]
take it easy won't change you.[A][N]
[...]Thank you for everything, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It is simply the least I could[N]
do, Lady Blair.[A] [...]By your leave.[N]
There's still much to be done.[A][X]
