Later that day...[X]

##IZAlexisConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis]
Your highness![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing, specifically. It's still[N]
just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so strange.[A][N]
That I can actually say that.[A][N]
The world's thought you dead[N]
for most of my life.[A][N]
And your life too, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] father's among them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you remember anything of him?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was quite young when last[N]
I saw him[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I faintly remember that[N]
he was a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] gentle man.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nothing concrete besides that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Soon enough, you'll finally get[N]
to meet him for real.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm proud to serve you and him both.[A][X]

##IZLeilaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeila][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I just wanted to see how[N]
you've been faring.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I spit on everything you and[N]
your father stand for.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet you're still here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's something to do.[N]
There's an answer.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Please bother someone else.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. Again, thanks.[N]
You've done well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't try and flatter me![N]
It doesn't work![A][X]

##IZHyperiusConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
So, tell me more about the[N]
trip down to Holanis.[A][N]
You mentioned having - and[N]
losing - a raft.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not really much to say, prince.[N]
We rafted through the Lowlands.[A][N]
That place is remarkably dangerous,[A][N]
and so we wanted to minimize any[N]
time we spent there.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] disaster struck.[A][N]
At least the journey wasn't[N]
too unbearable on foot.[A][N]
The world's quite large, but it's[N]
still smaller than you think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've barely been tracking how long[N]
we've been from Holanis,[A][N]
so I'll just take your word for that.[A][N]
In any case[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I appreciate you[N]
braving the world for my sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Think nothing of it. I've served[N]
your father my whole life,[A][N]
and I'll serve you as long as[N]
I can.[A][X]

##IZZachariasConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadZacharias]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thanks for the help back[N]
there, Zacharias.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Think nothing of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That meat you and Damien[N]
cooked up was tasty.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][X]

##IZDamienConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadDamien]
The prince of Elba Cor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's still insane to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? Aren't you from Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but your death was a big[N]
deal for a lot of the continent.[A][N]
Course, the Revolution was also[N]
going on, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Yeah.[A][N]
Yg'stra'd be up in flames if[N]
the emperor died.[A][N]
Well, maybe that's a bit dramatic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't the emperor decided by[N]
a combat tournament?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yup. So I guess it'd be less[N]
literal flames,[A] and moreso[N]
flames of ambition?[A][N]
Zach and I live more in the wilds, so[N]
this doesn't really impact us anyway.[A][N]
Whoever's on the throne doesn't change[N]
the critters in the woods.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a good way to look at it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. Still, to think that our[N]
emperor seeks to conquer Ulmaron[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's unexpected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've barely even heard of that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Hopefully it's all resolved by[N]
the time we reach Elba Cor.[A][X]

##IZOpening
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius]
We've been making good progress, prince.[A][N]
I believe we can afford to make camp[N]
here for the rest of the day.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I agree. Some rest would do us good.[A][N]
Plus, this'd be a good chance to[N]
get to know those Yg'strans better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Well, then. How's this clearing look?[A][N][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadDamien]
Seems like a good spot to me![A][N]
I'll find us some grub.[N]
Wanna help, Zach?[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][LoadZacharias]
Sure.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
Glad to see we'll be well[N]
fed, at least.[A][N]
I'll see about getting[N]
a fire going.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Good plan. Alexis and I can[N]
pitch some tents.[A][N]
Leila'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] keep watch, I guess.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then.[A][X]

##IZOpening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
That's that. Should be all set[N]
on firewood for the night.[A][N]
Guess I'll check up on the others.[A][X]

##IZEnding
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The fire's quite nice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It feels weird to think[N]
that I'm almost home.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd imagine it's unusual. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
it's a good thing.[A][N]
You're the future of Elba Cor.[N]
You deserve to return home.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, then. We'll continue[N]
our journey tomorrow.[A][X]
