##Ch11_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
We've arrived in Opistia.[N]
All I can see is sand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Blair. I understand how you're feeling,[N]
but for the rest of our sakes,[A][N]
we need your leadership.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]O-of course.[N]
A-apologies.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway. I believe our target is[N]
the capital city, Opistinia.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is everything here actually[N]
named after Opistus?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'd be correct. The capital's[N]
where the archbishop resides.[A][N]
We've just got to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think I heard something.[N]
Off in the distance.[A][X]

##Ch11_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie2]
We've got trouble, miss![N]
There's some unfamiliars at the shore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh? Intruders?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it.[A][N]
This was supposed to be simple.[N]
Well, you know what to do.[A][N]
Kill them all.[A][X]

##Ch11_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
They're approaching.[N]
What's your plan?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What other plan do we have?[N]
We must once again fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. If we can make it into[N]
those ruins, we should be alright.[A][N]
Just mind that we ought to keep[N]
some units back at the boat.[A][N]
We can't afford to take everyone[N]
into every fight, anymore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understandable.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Let's get this done.[A][X]

##Ch11_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
That's that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Who were those people? They appeared[N]
to be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] searching for something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm unsure, and it's likely not[N]
worth our concern.[A][N]
We must find the archbishop.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadVladmir]
Oho? Did someone call for me?[A][X]

##Ch11_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenRight][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
What lovely happenstance![N]
Opistus told me of this day.[A][N]
Greetings, young women. I am Vladmir,[N]
archbishop to the Church of Opistus.[A][N]
A pleasure to meet you.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah! Hello! I'm Blair, of Aercolyn.[N]
This is Arin.[A] We're here on behalf[N]
of King Brandl of Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd imagine it's about Yg'stra's[N]
recent actions.[A] We're loathe to[N]
engage in warfare,[A] but if it's necessary[N]
to protect our people, we shall fight.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In fact, on our way to Opistia,[N]
we happened upon some pilgrims.[A][N]
They were accosted by pirates,[N]
and we came to their aid.[A][N]
Unfortunately, they all met their[N]
end at the hands of the Yg'stran navy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Opistian lives have already[N]
met their end to this conflict.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Judgement shall be fierce[N]
and absolute.[A] But enough of that.[N]
I shall escort you to our capital.[A][N][OpenRight]
Thank you, sir![A][X]

##Ch11_Ending3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadValden][OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus][OpenMidLeft]
Lazarus. Care to explain yourself?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What for, oh, Commander Valden?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You damned well know. You once again[N]
left your post and threw away men.[A][N]
All for what? A noble with little[N]
to no bearing on this war?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's where you're wrong. She's[N]
a target of vital importance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The only importance she serves is[N]
driving you to madness.[A][N]
You've long been a problem, Lazarus.[N]
But you've also long been capable.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]However, you can hide behind your[N]
combat prowess no longer.[A][N]
Effective immediately, you are stripped of your[N]
post and to be dishonorably discharged.[A][N]
I will also require our sacred[N]
treasure be returned.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The Arkhinal[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]? You bastard![N]
Nobody else can use it like I can![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Too bad for you.[A][N]
I suppose we'll have to win this[N]
war on the strength of man.[A][N]
Now, begone from my sight.[N]
May you find purpose elsewhere.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That fool. He doesn't[N]
know what he's lost.[A][N]
Of course, I've that girl[N]
to blame for all this.[A][N]
But she's slipped my grasp[N]
for the last time.[A][N]
Our last encounters[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] were[N]
just the preamble.[A][N][CloseEyes]
All the misery I've forced[N]
her through[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It shall all come to a head.[N]
It'll be glorious.[A][N]
And then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'll be seen for[N]
the champion I truly am.[A][X]

##Ch11_Hilbert_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a child?[N]
What are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Child? I'm already 14 years old![N]
That's old enough to save people![A][N]
It's never too early to spread[N]
word of Hilbert the Hero![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, your name is Hilbert,[N]
I presume?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's right, miss![A][N]
I'm out here defending[N]
the people of Opistia![A][N]
You and your friends seem[N]
to be in need of help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate that, but you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, a mere child![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A-are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] doubting me?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll just have to prove[N]
myself capable, then![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And there he goes.[A][N]
I feel wrong about this,[N]
but who am I to stop him?[A][X]

##C11SofiaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
Our goals demand what[N]
relics lie in these sands.[A][N]
To that end, we must[N]
dispose of you.[A][X]

##C11SofiaDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSofia]
How[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Dying in[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
