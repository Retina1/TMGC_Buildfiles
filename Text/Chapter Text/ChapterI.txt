##ViridianArcPrimer
Welcome to the Viridian Chapters![A][N]
Similar to the Zeke Chapters,[N]
you'll focus on a small party.[A][N]
A few notes for Viridian's maps:[A][N]
-Viridian has a convoy that can hold[N]
up to 50 items,[A] as well as a[N]
separate gold supply from Blair.[A][N]
-Just like Zeke's maps, any unit[N]
death will be a game over.[A][N]
-You will get access to base[N]
preparations starting next map.[A][N]
-Some maps may force deploy large[N]
amounts of units.[A] Remember that[N]
you can rearrange force-deploys.[A][N]
Thanks for sticking with this hack[N]
for so long, and good luck![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's it, fellas.[N]
You want a piece of me?[A][N]
Well, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] HAVE AT ME![A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah, right. That.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Use it well, Rift.[A][X]

##V1Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
Well, my friend. We're finally[N]
in the money.[A] How's it feel?[N]
No discount inns for us now![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know I've been managing our[N]
finances tightly.[A] We've had[N]
premium inn money for months.[A][N]
I just felt it prudent not to[N]
waste it all in an instant.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Besides, it builds character.[N]
And you need character, Viridian.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's that supposed to mean?[A][N]
I'm a perfectly well rounded[N]
individual, Fred![A][N]
Besides, consider the rest of[N]
our company.[A][N][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadChartreuse]
It's quite fine by me. I'd rather[N]
a cheap room than none at all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
See? Chartreuse has my back![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And there's the[N]
imminent betrayal.[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadEliza]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I like comfy beds.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm glad we're of the[N]
same mind, Eliza.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadDean]
I appreciate the lightheartedness, but[N]
shouldn't we prepare for the job?[A][N]
Where'd Rift and Estelle run off?[A][N][OpenRight]
They're ahead scouting. We'll[N]
converge at the destination.[A][N]
I trust Rift's ability. And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Estelle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Look. She'll be fine.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll never understand some[N]
of your hiring decisions.[A][N]
I guess Eliza and Dirk were a package[N]
deal, and so were Rift and Estelle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But can you explain that Opistian?[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nope! Look, you try refusing a child[N]
that looks at you like that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Was nearly convinced she'd[N]
try to stab me.[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway. I believe we're near.[A][X]

##V1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian][OpenMidLeft]
It's been a while, Mevion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This place brings back[N]
memories.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not good ones, but[N]
that's beyond the point.[A][N]
Remember, everyone! We're being paid[N]
to clean out these raiders![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That reminds me. We got 10000 gold[N]
as a down payment.[A][N]
The other 10000 will come later.[N]
We should stock up here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We've been dealing with[N]
scraps ever since Couria.[A][N]
And as much as I love this bow,[N]
it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] seen better days.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anyway. I shall take point.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadDean][OpenMidRight]
Dean, run 'em through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadEliza][OpenMidRight]
Eliza, keep us healthy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Stay close to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Be ready for anything.[A][N]
Once Rift and Estelle converge,[N]
we'll be in a good position.[A][N][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wherever you are, Clarque[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'll make you proud.)[A][N][OpenEyes]
Virdians[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] advance![A][X]

##V1ViridianClarqueConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque][OpenMidLeft]
Clarque[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What are you doing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Viridian. Good to see[N]
my protege is well.[A][N]
I took a job. That's all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How could you? Don't you see[N]
what these brutes have done?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What of it?[A][N]
I have nothing left in[N]
this world.[A][N]
Nothing left tying me[N]
to this country.[A][N]
Do you remember my sons?[A][N]
They all threw themselves into[N]
battle, and they all died.[A][N]
Why should I deserve a peaceful[N]
end? A glorious end?[A][N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Listen to yourself. You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
done so many great things.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You've taught me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so much.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've failed him.[N]
We've failed everyone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It certainly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
could've gone better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Does[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Does it ever get easier?[A][N]
Having to kill so many?[N]
Our friends dying before us?[A][N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Tell me.[N]
It[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] has to.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It doesn't. It never gets easier.[A][N]
But in a way[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's a blessing.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It keeps you human. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're something[N]
special.[A] 'Twould be a shame for you[N]
to lose yourself to heartlessness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for everything, Clarque.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can't throw in the towel[N]
just because you've screwed up once.[A][N]
Don't tell me that's your intent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not at all. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
need some time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. I care about you.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't forget that.[A][X]

##V1ViridianClarqueConvo2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I have nothing left, Viridian.[N]
My sons are gone.[A][N]
My pride is gone. At least let[N]
me die with a weapon in hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I refuse to strike you down.[N]
I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] old friend.[A][N]
I wish I could give you that[N]
mercy.[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] But I'm not strong[N]
enough, I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So what, then? Are we gonna stare at[N]
each other until the end of time?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've had ample time to strike[N]
me down.[A] And yet, you've held your[N]
weapons back.[A] You don't want this.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Retreat, and live. My friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're[N]
right, Viridian.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I'm leaving,[N]
at least take this.[A][N]
You'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] find a use for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A] Where shall[N]
you go, now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know, anymore.[N]
But I'll find a way forward.[A][N]
And I'll pay you back someday.[A][X]
