[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungElcorian][OpenMidLeft]
You're doing well, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you say so, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You still have doubts on[N]
your mind. Lay yourself bare.[A][N]
I truly do wish to clear up[N]
anything clouding you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] I don't deserve any of this.[A][N]
I still feel like nothing more than[N]
an outsider.[A][CloseEyes] Why[...] What have I[N]
done to earn any of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You are a brilliant young man.[A][N]
There is no need for you to doubt[N]
your intellect or your station.[A][N]
[...]I've been meaning to give you something[N]
for some time now.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]A sword?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More a symbollic prop than anything.[A][N]
You surely know of Arbordia's relic,[N]
the Foundation.[A] Well, that's only[N]
half of the story.[A] It's a truth[N]
lost to time,[A] but the Foundation was[N]
created by the founding lord of Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What do you mean, lost to time?[N]
The founding lord was Ar-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aercolyn. [...]That's where the truth[N]
has since been muddled.[A][N]
The founding Arbordia was a dear[N]
friend of the founding Aercolyn.[A][N]
As a show of goodwill, Aercolyn[N]
crafted a sword beyond wonder.[A][N]
[...]This blade. The Creator.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's[...] exquisite.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Some generations back, the Foundation[N]
was stolen, the Creator was hidden,[A][N]
and the story of Dalst was entirely[N]
rewritten.[A] Part of me had considered[N]
eventually bringing that truth to light.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But then[...][N]
Sinclair von Aercolyn[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]His legacy deserves[N]
nothing now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Still[...] Did he not[N]
have a daughter?[A][N]
Does she not deserve to[N]
one day learn this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose that depends.[A][N]
Will she repent for her father's[N]
ruinous legacy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[...] Is it her place to?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. Perhaps not.[A][N]
[...]Why does this interest you so?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Pity, I suppose. She may very well[N]
forever be outcast from Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And you are hardly outcast, Elcorian.[N]
Trust me. Just[...] give it time.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Your place is with us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This blade[...] The Creator. I entrust[N]
it to you as proof of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are[...] Are you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is a blade nobody has seen[N]
for many decades.[A] It will[N]
hardly make much fuss.[A][N]
Keep it at your side and know that[N]
you deserve to be where you are.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. Thank you, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Elcorian.[N]
Now, then. Let us be off.[A][N]
You still have infinite[N]
potential within you.[A][X]
