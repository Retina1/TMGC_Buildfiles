Are you alright? You appear to be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
wildly swinging your staff.[A][N]
Is an insect bothering you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh. Wouldn't think an Opistian would[N]
talk about humans that way.[A][N]
Well, the world surprises ya'[N]
sometimes, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Oh. You meant an actual bug.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nope. I'm good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure? I can't imagine a[N]
staff'd be an effective implement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You'd be surprised at how many bones[N]
this thing has both broken and mended.[A][N]
It almost makes me think. Except thinking's[N]
not as fun as beating people over the head.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. Well, keep yourself safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! Tell that to that[N]
idiot over there![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I'm good.[A][X]

Ah, Sveltzalus. Stand back[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Float back, please.[A][N]
I wouldn't want to hurt you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveFarLeft][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, friend. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's weird[N]
to call an eyeball a friend.[A][N]
But, hey. Life's a strange thing.[N]
And you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nice company.[A][N]
Quiet. I like that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What're you doin',[N]
weird eyeball dude?[A][N]
You're staring at me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Am I that much of a looker?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see comedy has died.[N]
Look, go away. Stare at someone else.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Unless[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hey, I've always wondered[N]
what was inside my eyeballs.[A][N]
Care if I get a good look at you?[N]
Jiggle you a bit? See if anything's in there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, you arse.[N]
Be like that.[A][X]

##CassiusHyperiusCSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
I see you're doing well for[N]
yourself, general.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, youngster. Frankly,[N]
it's a little surprising,[A][N]
the fact that you're still alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
W-what's that supposed to mean?[N]
I'm young! I'm fit! I'm Cassius![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Age is meaningless on the battlefield.[N]
Even the most athletic can meet their end.[A][N][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
And, frankly, I think being Cassius is[N]
a net negative on life expectancy.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You wound me, old man. I'm sure I'll[N]
outlive you, at the very least.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Ha! Perhaps if you retire at the ripe[N]
age of 19. And even then, who knows.[A][N]
Maybe I've got four hundred years[N]
left in these old bones![A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
That's a horror I'd wish on nobody.[A][N][OpenEyes]
For real, though. I'm glad you're[N]
well. You keep things interesting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Agreed, Cassius.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Greetings, Sveltzalus.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still can't believe that name.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I mean, it's a fine name. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not what I figured Blair'd come up with.[A][N]
Anyway[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Keep up the good work?[N]
You've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite helpful?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I doing this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, then.[N]
Good day to you.[A][X]

Ah, Hilbert. How have you been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Check this out, Mister Emile![A][N][MoveMidRight]
Fwoosh![A][N]
Pretty impressive, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] impressive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks! I've been practicing nonstop[N]
ever since we were in Yg'stra![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So that's what the bright flashes[N]
in the night were.[A][N]
I'm glad to see you're picking[N]
things up quickly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's all thanks to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly. The talent[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's all you.[A][N]
All I've done is show you some[N]
hand gestures and theory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but without you, I would've[N]
never known the magic moves![A][N]
You're a great teacher, Mister Emile![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate it, Hilbert.[A][X]

Another day, another battle.[A][N]
Better men than I would've[N]
given up on this by now.[A][N]
And that's to say nothing of[N]
you, Sam. I'm truly amazed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-thank you, sir. It's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
scary, for sure[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not sure if[N]
I made the right choice[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I've met brilliant people[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
like you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, Sam! I'm simply[N]
doing my duty.[A] Saving the world[N]
from the wretched,[A] while giving[N]
the old family some spare change.[A][N]
Speaking of, have you been in[N]
touch with your family at all?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]N-no. I doubt they[N]
even notice I'm gone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. Well, know that you're[N]
a true knight of Dalst.[A][N]
After this is over, we'd be[N]
happy to keep you with us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, sir.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Sam, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that's correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, what did you need me for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] just wanted to[N]
ask about my technique.[A][N]
Y-you're a pretty fantastic[N]
sharpshooter, after all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm flattered, but you're quite[n]
skilled too.[A][N]
Don't sell yourself short.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. Even if you're lacking in sheer[N]
power, you make up in precision.[A][N]
I can't recall you missing any[N]
shots that've truly counted.[A][N]
I mean, we've not fought together[N]
long, but I doubt that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad you think highly of me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But you'll always be an unreachable[N]
goal for me to aspire to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Athena! Just who I wanted to see![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've got a wild proposition for you.[N]
Can I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hitch a ride?[A][N]
On your wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You see, though I hate to admit it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My armor leaves me a little[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] slow.[A][N]
I had hoped you could carry me to the[N]
frontlines, where I'd be effective.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. Hop on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yippee![A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
You seem excited.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To be frank, while there is of course[N]
strategic value to wyvern riding[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've also just always wanted to ride one.[N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thanks![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Actually, on second thought. Let's wait.[N]
Don't wanna overwhelm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What's the name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The name? Of the wyvern?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] personal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Well, perhaps after the battle,[N]
we can test their weight limit.[A][N]
I look forward to it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How was I supposed to know[N]
I needed to name you, friend?[A][X]

You can't hide forever![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you still on that dark magic thing?[N]
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not just a thing, mister![A][N]
I've lost friends[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and even[N]
my family to dark magic![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, calamities brought upon[N]
by dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sorry to hear that. But I'd like[N]
you to understand something.[A][N]
I'm on your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

to me![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Back to the battle. I'll[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do I even try with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, indeed? At least I know[N]
how messed up I am.[A][N]
You clearly think there's something[N]
worth saving in me.[A][N]

Of course. I'd be happy to see[N]
