Tell me, captain. What IS it[N]
like being a pirate?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, that be a vague question.[N]
Piracy... It be everything.[A][N]
It's not just a thing we do...[N]
It's a way we live.[A][N]
Treatin' it as a hobby or a job[N]
or whatnot... That be disingenuous.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh. Guess I never thought of it[N]
like that. Well, then...[A][N]
How'd you end up meeting the king?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Och, now that be a tale all its own.[A][N]
Me memory's a bit fuzzy, but I[N]
believe it began wit' other pirates.[A][N]
Some rival crew were botherin' a[N]
civilian ship,[A] so me boys stepped[N]
in. ...Pure altruism, of course.[A][N]
No plans o' makin' off with some[N]
booty of our own.[A][N]
Well, turns out that was more than[N]
a civilian ship.[A] It was the Elba[N]
Corian royal family's private vessel.[A][N]
Before we knew it, we were somethin'[N]
of heroes.[A] Frankly, those other[N]
pirates were pathetic runts.[A][N]
But, aye... That be beyond the point.[A][N]
The king invited me mateys for drinks,[N]
which, if ye know pirates,[A][N]
is basically askin' to empty yer coffers,[N]
and the rest be history.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's... quite the story, captain![N]
King Brandl's quite lucky to have you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, and now ye be lucky to have him.[N]
So, ye be lucky to have me, too.[A][N]
Speakin' o' lucky...[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Catch this![A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
What's this you lobbed at me?[N]
A book?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ayup. Found this little number during[N]
a rumble wit' some upstart pirates.[A][N]
Their cap' was this man named Gregorias.[N]
Thinks he has what it takes to rule the seas.[A][N]
Well, we proved 'im wrong. Got some[N]
spoils in exchange for lettin' em go.[A][N]
That book was among 'em, but...[N]
Literature don't serve us well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, captain. Both for[N]
your tales, and the book.[A][X]
