//This is an installer for the instrument map, which is a series of pointers pointing to various instruments.
//If you are using this, there is no need to also install the native instrument map (NIMAP); this installer replaces it.
//The premiere feature of this installer, aside from making everything modular and allowing easy installation of custom
//samples, is the ability to have key splits, i.e. instruments that play different samples depending on the pitch.
//This results in a noticeable quality increase in instruments such as string ensembles, where previously there were
//separate instrument slots using samples meant for low, mid, high, etc notes.

//The main types of voices (instruments) you'll be concerning yourself with are Direct, Multi, and Drum.
//Square1, Square2, Wave, and Noise are typically used by GBA games in combination with a handful of Direct samples
//to make music, but the Fire Emblem games' sound engine is arranged in such a way that music uses Direct
//(that is, streamed audio) samples for all of its instruments, with only one square wave/noise/etc able to be played at once.
//For this reason, Square, Wave, and Noise are usually only used for sound effects, and I have included commands for
//them for this reason as well as for completion's sake. Don't try to use them in music; sfx such as menu blips will cut them off.

//The instruments that now use key splits are: 0, 19, 48, 49, 52, 56, 68, 71, 73, 103, 105.

#ifdef _FE8_

#include "drumfix_fe8.event"
//Recommended if using vanilla drums. Don't use the drum fix if you're customising the drum tables yourself; it will overwrite your pointers.

//VoiceDummy is for quick demarcation of unused/empty instrument slots

//Explanation of parameters:
//VoiceTable: the voice table you are writing to. Your instrument map is a voice table; multi instruments and drum instruments also get their own respective table for their own set of samples. This parameter is mainly a precaution against tables overwriting one another.
//VoiceIndex: the slot in the voice table for this instrument (for example, 0 is typically used for the acoustic grand piano). 0x0 thru 0x7f correspond to instruments 0 thru 127.
//BaseNote: the base note. I recommend always using 0x3c (middle C) because I don't think GBA FE supports other notes. Left the option just in case.
//Address: the location of the sample. If you're using a custom sample, this will be a label pointing EA to the data for your sample which will be written to the rom.
//If you just want to use a vanilla sample, you can just use its vanilla address instead of using a label.
//FixedFreq: fixes the frequency of the note so it cannot change in pitch. Typically used for drums. 0x10 =on; 0x0 =off.
//IsForcedPan: whether or not the note should be forced to a certain L/R balance. Typically used for drums. 0x1 =on; 0x0 =off.
//Pan: how far left or right to pan the sample if you turned on IsForcedPan. 0x00 =off. 0x80 =0 (all the way left); 0xff =127 (all the way right).
//DutyCycle: the ratio of a square wave's segments, which will change its sound. 0x0 is 12,5%; 0x1 is 25%; 0x2 is 50%; 0x3 is 75%.
//NoteOffWithNoise: the note will be cut off by noise. Used very rarely in sound effects. 0x0 =off; 0x1 =on.
//SweepTime: how long it takes a square wave to sweep from one pitch to another. Sometimes used in sound effects (think weird magic sounds). Must be a multiple of 0x10. 00: disable. 0x10: 7,8ms. 0x20: 15,6ms. 0x30: 23,4ms 0x40: 31,3ms. 0x50: 39,1ms. 0x60: 46,9ms. 0x70: 54,7ms.
//SweepShift: how many bits the wave should be sweeped in pitch. 0x0 or 0x8: disable. 0x1 thru 0x7: add 2 thru 8 bits. 0x9 thru 0xf: subtract 2 thru 8 bits.
//WaveData: a pointer to a 16-byte chart determining the pattern of the wave. 0 thru f determines the amplitude (y co-ordinate) of the wave, with 7-8 being 0 dB.
//example: 0011223468abcdeeffeeddcb97543211 makes sort of a sine wave. ffffffffffffffff0000000000000000 is a square wave.
//NoisePattern: how many samples are used to generate the noise. 0x0: 32768 samples; 0x1: 256 samples.
//MultiSampleTable: a pointer to another instrument table for your multi instrument to use for its samples.
//NoteChart: a label pointing to included data for the note chart, a series of bytes that say which notes should play which samples.
//DrumTable: a pointer to another instrument table for your drums to use.
//Envelope information:
//EnvAtk: Attack, or how long it takes for the instrument to go from zero to full volume when a note starts to be played. Higher values are faster.
//EnvDec: Decay, or how quickly the note loses volume after the attack. Higher values are longer. 0x0 to make the sample not decay at all.
//EnvSus: Sustain, or what level of volume the note should rest at after the attack and decay but while the note is still playing. Higher values are louder. 0xff is the maximum for samples; 0xf is the maximum for waves and noise.
//EnvRel: Release, or how long it takes for the note to drop to zero volume after it is no longer being played. Higher values are longer.

//voice tables

//Just for reference, the note indicated after the name of each instrument is the base note. If your music is sounding
//grating on the ears or inaudible, make sure your samples aren't straying too far from their base notes. Multi-sample
//instruments will have a range instead of a single note. C3 is middle C (Anvil Studio refers to middle C as C5 or C4,
//depending on your settings). A number in parentheses (e.g. +1) indicates the sample being an octave higher or lower
//than expected (e.g. a C3 with instrument 80 (square lead) sounds like a C4).

//MESSAGE Main voice table begins at CURRENTOFFSET
//Uncomment the above line if you want to know where exactly the installer is writing the voice table every time.
//This is useful to ascertain the table location when using GBAMusRiper to make a soundfont.

//note charts

//Note: if you don't want yet another file to include for each chart, you can just use BYTE commands to "write out" the charts.
//for example: BYTE $00 $00 $00 $00 $00 $01 $01 $01 $02 $02 $02 etc. You can just copy and paste the bytes from the
//note chart files included if you don't get it, or look at the readme for an example. Each byte is a note on the proverbial piano,
//so you're telling the game "this instrument should use sample 0 for notes x thru y, sample 1 for y thru z, etc.

//sample data

//"GS" instruments refer to the synth instruments used in Golden Sun, which can be used in your FE mod given you have ipatix's sound mixer installed.
//The triangle and bass wave do not have any customiseable parameters, but you can use GSSquareMacro to make a square wave with custom parameters.
//These samples are useful for emulating the sound of many GBA games, which use square waves alongside Direct samples to make their music.
//Since using square waves in music is off limits in GBA FE because square waves are already used for sound effects, you can "cheat" by using these GS synths as if they were regular samples.
//Refer to the readme for more information.
