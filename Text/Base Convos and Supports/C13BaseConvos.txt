##C13_Delusion
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh! Hey, Jeff! Almost[N]
didn't see you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And yet you did, and the maddening[N]
cycle continues.[A][N]
[...]What do you need?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing in particular. Just[...][N]
checking in on the old convoy rat.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Of course. [...]Tell me,[N]
what am I doing here?[A][N]
Why am I, a vile piece of scum, halfway[N]
across the world,[A] about to die for[N]
a cause I don't believe in?[A][N]
What the hell is wrong with me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I don't know. But[...] If you ever[N]
want to leave, I won't stop you.[A][N]
I know that I've dragged us all[N]
into this, and I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well, I can't leave on that note.[N]
Damn my self-loathing.[A][N]
But, if I'm gonna stay, may as[N]
well make the most of it.[A][N]
I nicked this from a sucker back[N]
in Opistinia. Take it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm not sure how I feel about-[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][N]
and he's gone. Well, then.[A][N]
[...]This IS a nice scroll.[N]
If we have it[...] May as well.[A][X]

##C13_Blair_Arin_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]Hey, Arin.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What troubles you, Blair?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing in particular, I guess.[A][N]
It's just[...] Well, you know.[N]
A lot has happened lately.[A][N]
One moment, we're enjoying life in Aercolyn[N]
and on the road to relegitimization,[A][N]
the next, we're running for our lives[N]
and rubbing elbows with royalty,[A][N]
and then the next, people are literally[N]
dying for us.[A] It's[...] a lot[N]
of change. A lot of pressure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. While some of these issues are[N]
similar to what you'd face in governing,[A][N]
they're obviously[...] more life-and-death[N]
than regular everyday problems.[A][N]
We're living in tumultuous times,[N]
and I'm sure even after Yg'stra,[A][N]
things won't get much simpler.[A][N]
But that's why you have us.[N]
I shall stay by your side.[A][N]
I may not bear any title,[N]
but I'll always be your friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's comforting to hear.[A][N]
[...]I'd been meaning to ask for a while,[N]
but how'd you end up in Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, you're not from Dalst, right?[N]
I'm just wondering.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Are you alright?[N]
You don't have to speak of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just[...] collecting my thoughts.[N]
We've a battle to fight.[A][N]
It would be best to chat later.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Just[...] let me[N]
know if you ever need to talk.[A][N]
I just know I burden you a lot, and[N]
that just[...] doesn't feel right.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's hardly a problem.[N]
But I appreciate it.[A][X]

##C13_Arin_Sam_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadSam][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, Sam. I was wondering if you[N]
could tell more of House Barford.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's[...] not much to tell, really.[N]
We're not even on many maps.[A][N]
Hardly one of the three great houses.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose, but there's still value in[N]
learning of your heritage.[A][N]
I'm sure Barford's got some[N]
valuable contributions to Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Nothing comes to mind.[A][N]
I was never going to inherit the[N]
land, in any case.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You have siblings, I presume?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. One of my brothers, four years[N]
older than me[...] He's next in line.[A][N]
That leaves the rest of us to[N]
either marry into bigger houses,[A][N]
or[...] whatever I did, I suppose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understandable. Always[N]
a pleasure chatting.[A][X]

##C13_Josef_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJosef][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, young man![N]
What can I do for you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're Mister Josef, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You flatter me, but just[N]
Josef will do.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, Mister Josef, I've seen[N]
how you fight. You're so cool![A][N]
Can you teach me a few things?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd be honored, though I'm not[N]
quite sure what to teach a mage.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Teach me how to take a beatin'[N]
real well, please![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're always up in the action,[N]
getting kicked around.[A][N]
But you always stay standing![N]
That's what I want to do![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] see. You don't have any armor.[A][N]
I can't just let you go out[N]
and get yourself impaled.[A][N]
That's the point of the armor.[N]
I get impaled so you don't have to.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well, mister.[A][N]
I guess I'll just have to find[N]
some armor of my own![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Wait! Come back![N]
I'M the knight here![A][X]

##C13_Jeff_Sveltzalus_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadSveltzalus]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So you're that eyeball thing.[N]
What in the hell has my life come to?[A][N]
Why am I in an army alongside[N]
a floating eyeball?[A][N]
Hell, why am I in an army at all?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're you lookin' at me like[N]
that for, you bastard?[A][N]
[...]Sorry. I know you're an eye.[N]
Looking's probably all you do.[A][N]
Stealing and shanking's all I do.[N]
I can relate.[A][N]
[...]Gotta say. You're a cute critter.[N]
For being an eyeball, that is.[A][X]


##C13_Apollo_Flynn_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Greetings! I see that you're[N]
wearing Opistian garb.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Just thought to make small[N]
talk with another Opistian.[A][N]
It's comforting to see people[N]
from your homeland in this army.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Sorry. I'm not[N]
much for talk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's quite alright, friend.[N]
[...]You're Flynn, right?[A][N]
I'm Apollo.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
That's right.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't be. There's a certain[N]
beauty to silence.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][X]

##C13_Emile_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Mister![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Hilbert?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're a powerful sage, right?[N]
Can[...] Can you teach me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can't promise I'd be a great[N]
teacher, but[...] sure thing![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need to be humble, mister![N]
I've heard you taught the nice lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I guess I HAVE tutored Blair[...][N]
But[...] I'm sure it's mostly her.[A][N]
Still, I'll show you what I know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you so much![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I'm always glad to[N]
share my knowledge.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
When do you wanna start?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How about after this battle?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sounds good! See ya then![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What a nice kid. He[...][N]
He could do better than me, right?[A][X]
