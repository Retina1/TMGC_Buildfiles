##C27GirardBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
We do this for the future[N]
of Dalst.[A] All else is but[N]
meaningless in the end.[A][N]
If you do not recognize this,[N]
you have no place among us.[A][N]
[...]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C27GirardDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[...]It[...] cannot[...][N]
end[...] like this[...][A][N]
I must[...] take my leave.[N]
When we[...] meet again[...][A][N]
The fate of this world[...][N]
Shall be[...] decided[...][A][X]

##C27NorthWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
They're taking a straightforward approach.[N]
How bold of them.[A] [...]Alert the southern[N]
mounted division,[A] and relay a message to[N]
our northern reserves.[A][N]
We'll see how they handle a pincer attack.[A][X]
##C27NorthWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Distracting our forces to mount a direct[N]
assault? Not a bad strategy.[A][N]
Still[...] How ever will they handle[N]
our northern reserves?[A][N]
We will have to wait and see.[A][X]

##C27EastWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Taking the side entrance into the city[...][N]
Not a terrible approach at all.[A][N]
[...]Move our armored divsion in.[A][N]
Hold the invaders up while we prepare[N]
to reinforce the ramparts.[A][N]
That chokepoint will hopefully be[N]
their demise.[A][X]
##C27EastWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
A diversion while they sneak through[N]
the side entrace. Crafty.[A][N]
Still, we've ample men to reinforce the[N]
ramparts.[A] Death from afar, I say.[A][X]

##C27WestWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
The waterbound entrance. An obvious[N]
weakness for any invader to exploit.[A][N]
[...]And of course, one with an obvious[N]
solution.[A] Dispatch our flier division.[A][N]
They'll hold them off long enough for[N]
our artillery to get in position.[A][N]
And then we will show them the gravity[N]
of their understimation.[A][X]
##C27WestWarningAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Trying to slip troops through the[N]
waterway while we're distracted?[A][N]
Not a bad gambit at all.[A][N]
[...]Artillery, prepare to make[N]
pincushions of their forces.[A][X]

##C27CenterWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Come, troops! From our doors![N]
From our streets![A][N]
The invaders have breached your[N]
walls.[A] Show them the might[N]
of Arbordia's finest![A][X]
##C27Center2Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
They're drawing close to the hall.[N]
I mustn't fail Elcorian on this day.[A][N]
My troops! It is time for our[N]
decisive and final victory![A][N]
We'll trap them near and[N]
bring them to their knees![A][X]
