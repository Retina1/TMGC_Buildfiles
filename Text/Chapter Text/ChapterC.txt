[OpenMidLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan]
For Opistus's sake, Todd.[A][N]
That's the fourteenth bar this month[N]
you've been banned from for life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
First of all, it's Toddsworth, not Todd.[N]
Second, can you blame me?[A][N]
That idiot was basically begging for[N]
me to punch him in the face![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure. Because he had the gall to ask[N]
you to stop flirting with his wife.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, that's fair. Not right of me[N]
to leave him out.[A][N]
But to think he'd still be mad after[N]
I pour my heart out to him![A][N]
I swear, everyone's the same.[N]
Absolutely terrible.[A][N]
Gods, I need a drink.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nope. We're getting you out of this town[N]
before you end up dead in a ditch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rude.[A][X]

##Z3RecruitmentText2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenLeft][LoadAvan][OpenFarLeft]
Well, my dear Avan. Looks like[N]
we've got trouble on the road.[A][N][OpenLeft]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] isn't great. I've no weapons,[N]
and you've no skill in the slightest.[A][N]
What are we to do?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon me. Are you two alright?[N]
You seem to be fleeing.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
We're good. Just some[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] local authorities.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Ignore him. We'd like some help.[N]
I'm Avan, and the fop is Todd.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Toddsworth![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright, then. Stay close to us.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. I've got experience[N]
with staves, and Todd, here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'll serenade you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's a threat.[A][X]

##Z3NorthVillageText
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman3]
You're with the kingdom, right?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Brilliant! Our town's got a lovely[N]
treasure.[A] Problem is, nobody here[N]
can use it. Take it off our hands.[A][N]
I swear that it'll gouge Yg'strans[N]
real good![A][X]

##Z3SouthVillageText
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan3]
What's the leading cause of death?[N]
Running out of health, of course![A][N]
Well, this sword here'll help you[N]
out with that.[A][N]
Just sucks away your foe's vitality[N]
in an instant.[A][N]
Is it ethical? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Probably not.[N]
But do your enemies deserve ethics?[A][N]
Absolutely not! That's why[N]
they're your enemies![A][X]

##Z3House1Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan6]
Have you been keeping yourself well?[N]
No, not you you.[A][N]
That you. The you reading this.[A][N]
Do you need a drink? A snack? A nap?[N]
Take care of yourself.[A][N]
This land isn't your entire life,[N]
you know. You deserve a break.[A][X]

##Z3House2Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman4]
It's truly hellish[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Yg'stra refuses to[N]
believe the war's over[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Mevion's ransacking us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And worst of all, I can't[N]
find my good silverware![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look, I spent seven months' salary[N]
on that cutlery.[A][N]
Losing it is worse than war.[N]
Trust me.[A][X]

##Z3House3Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan1]
I think some mercs passed by a bit ago.[N]
Seems they headed towards the capital.[A][N]
I'm sure now that the war's over,[N]
there'll be unrest.[A][N]
That's a job for a merc to handle.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if you'll handle this for free,[N]
that's even better, of course![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keeping us safe should be its[N]
own reward, right?[A][X]

##Z3House4Text
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan2]
Death's a scary thing, youngster.[A][N]
But if there's any solace to be found[N]
within its cold embrace,[A]
it's that your friends get to[N]
keep your stuff.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do you mean that's obvious?[A][N]
I've seen many places. You wouldn't[N]
believe how wasteful some people are.[A][X]

##Z3ParqueBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadParque]
What're you looking at?[N]
These're my scraps.[A][N]
I'm gonna be the new[N]
king of this realm.[A][N]
It's what my brothers[N]
would've wanted.[A][X]

##Z3ParqueZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadParque]
That hair[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
No, that's impossible.[A][N]
You must be some manner[N]
of impostor.[A][N]
Well, upstart impostor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
This is MY kingdom now![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Wrong. This is my kingdom.[N]
I shall end your terror.[A][X]

##Z3ParqueDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadParque]
Grah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] So this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
is it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I guess what they say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
is true[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Not every man[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
can be a king[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Z3Damn
[OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Damn it! The manor's fallen.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Looks like we're finished.[A][X]

##ArcZekeEnding
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The truth behind Prince Zeke's [OpenQuote]death[CloseQuote][N]
has been uncovered,[A] and Elba Cor[N]
can move ahead into the future.[A][N]
The fate of Yg'stra is still up[N]
in the air,[A] as are the many[N]
questions within Blair's mind,[A][N]
and inevitably, the struggle[N]
for Ulmaron must begin anew.[A][X]
