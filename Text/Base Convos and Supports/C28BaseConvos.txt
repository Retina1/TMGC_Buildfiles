Well, lassie. This is a bit sad.[N]
I fear this may be the last we speak.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's truly a shame.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, let's get on with it.[N]
The final patented shop hint![A][N]
[...]Well, actually. This is[N]
quite awkward.[A][N]
No real way to say it that wouldn't[N]
just ruin the whole mystery.[A][N]
It's[...] pretty obvious, really.[A][N]
You could ask me for some kind[N]
of riddle that'd hint at it[...][A][N]
Or you could just use the warp staff.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'll just[...] head out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No, I mean it. Even if[...][N]
the hints were a bit goofy.[A][N]
It's nice knowing these shops[N]
exist at all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thanks, lassie. Anyhoot,[N]
I gotta go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's been good to know you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Godspeed. I[...] just know you can do anything[N]
you set your mind to, lassie.[A][N]
Anna and I are proud to have[N]
helped you on your journey.[A][N]
And you too, person behind the[N]
screen.[A] [...]Thanks for coming[N]
along on this incredible journey.[A][N]
[...]Have a swell day![A][X]
