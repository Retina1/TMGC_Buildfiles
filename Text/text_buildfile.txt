Welcome to the arena.[A][NL]
I see you're back.[A][2NL]
I've lost a lot of gold[NL]
thanks to you.[A][2NL]
If you want to continue,[A][2NL]
we're going to have to[NL]
change things up.[A][2NL]
These foes will give you[NL]
a run for your money.[A][X]

# 0x0840
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJake][CloseEyes]Honk[...] Mimimimimimimimi[...][N]
Honk[...] Mimimimimimimimi[...][A][N][OpenEyes]
Ah! What're you doin' back here?[N]
This was supposed to be a secret![A][N]
Well, I guess while you're here,[N]
I could let loose a few tidbits[...][A][N]
Don't go tellin' others, though![N]
Now, let's see here[...][A][N]
I've got it! I'll let ya' know how[N]
to find the ten secret units![A][N]
If you wanna find them yourself,[N]
turn off the game console now![A][N]
First up's Agnes! She's hiding on[N]
the cracked road in Chapter 11.[A][N]
Next is Addington, the automaton![N]
He's for sale in Chapter 12x.[A][N]
Interact with the cracked tile[N]
near the staircase to buy him.[A][N]
After that you've got Gaylord, a[N]
sleepy pilgrim.[A] You gotta visit[N]
him in Chapter 13 until he wakes up.[A][N]
Then there's Q.[A][N]
She'll appear in Chapter 19 if you step[N]
on dark grass after flooding the river.[A][N]
Then, you've got Clarque! Spare him[N]
in Chapter I,[A] and then wait for[N]
him to appear briefly in Chapter V.[A][N]
He's sure to join then![A][N]
As for Tonnamin, the wayward brother[...][A][N]
Visit every inn you can in every[N]
interlude you visit![A][N]
I'm sure he'll appreciate a well[N]
traveled youngster.[A][N]
Next up is Laronde, the devoted brother![A][N]
For him, make sure the young mage Rose[N]
survives the events of Viridian Arc.[A][N]
He's sure to join you then![A][N]
[...]If she doesn't, maybe you can try[N]
consoling him. It'll be tricky, though.[A][N]
We can't forget Kyrie, the swordmaster.[A][N]
She'll appear if you visit the southern[N]
village in Chapter 25 -[A] but only if[N]
your inventory is specifically lined up![A][N]
Hold a 2-use item in slot 1, a 3-use in[N]
slot 2, and a 6-use in slot 3![A][N]
Then, there's Jonas, the Yg'stran[N]
wyvern rider. He's the hardest.[A][N]
In Chapter 10, you gotta beat Lazarus[...][N]
while making sure Jonas lives![A][N]
Once you beat Laz, Jonas will retreat[N]
to live another day, and one day[...][A][N]
Well, he'll find himself in your army![A][N]
Lastly, there's Valeria, Viridian's mom![A][N]
In Chapter 27, you gotta bring as many[N]
people she'd know as possible.[A][N]
[...]I think that's four.[A][N]
That's all the advice I have for you.[N]
Good luck, and thanks for playin'![A][X]
