##C26Village1Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
You're fighting for Lady Blair?[A][N]
[...]Well. This won't be easy for you.[N]
But I have something that might help.[A][N]
Funny story. Got in a real heated[N]
argument with a bud once.[A][N]
The man told me to go to hell.[N]
I[...] might've misinterpreted.[A][N]
And so I've been stuck with a book[N]
I couldn't use.[A] But, hey. It may[N]
help you win the day.[A][N]
Guess it'll have all been worth it.[A][X]

##C26Village2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
You need somethin' from me?[A][N]
Hm[...] Guess you can borrow my[N]
old walkin' stick for a few.[A][N]
[...]Wait. What am I doin'? I got[N]
this fancy staff right 'ere![A][N]
[...]I'm gettin' on in years,[A]N]
but you'd think I could tell my[N]
walkin' stick from a magical rod.[A][N]
Good thing I noticed quick, at[N]
the very least.[A] This thing[N]
looks mighty fragile.[A][N]
Surely couldn't handle my[N]
weight all day.[A][X]

##C26Village3Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Used to be a real accomplished[N]
lumberjack back in my prime.[A][N]
Still got myself an axe for every[N]
situation one could imagine.[A][N]
Those days are behind me, though.[N]
You can take the jewel of my collection.[A][N]
It's never even been used. Always felt[N]
using it on a tree would be overkill.[A][X]

##C26Village4Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie3]
Check this out, bud.[A][N]
Snagged it from an arena.[N]
One of their bloodsport books.[A][N]
Can you feel the sheer power[N]
radiating from it?[A][N]
This[...] This is not something[N]
normal people can get.[A][N]
I've got a few more in storage.[N]
You can give this one a spin.[A][N]
Just mind yourself. It's not[N]
exactly[...] reliable.[A][X]

##C26Village5Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman4]
[...]I'm[...] so very tired[...][A][N]
I bought myself a Sleep staff[...][N]
But I ran into a problem[...][A][N]
I can't cast it on myself[...][N]
Take it[...] Do what you must[...][A][N]
Then[...] If you have time[...][N]
Come back and cast it on me[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
I need[...] real sleep[...][A][X]

##C26Village6Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Woah[...] Are you fighting outside?[N]
You're so cool and brave[...][A][N]
Since you're a real soldier, have[N]
a look at my cool drawing![A][N]
It's a sword![A][N]
[...]You can take it with you[N]
if you want![A] I can always[N]
draw another sword.[A][X]

##C26Village7Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
Sorry to bother you, but can[N]
you take this off my hands?[A][N]
This ring's just been giving me[N]
bad feelings ever since I found it.[A][N]
Like it's compelling me to be more[N]
efficient with my time[...][A][N]
I don't need a lecture from a[N]
piece of jewelry of all things.[A][X]

##C26House1Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1]
Lady Ethyl seems to be taking the[N]
field today.[A] I can't say if she's[N]
ever taken it before,[A] but I'd[N]
think the army can function without her.[A][N]
Taking her out early would certainly[N]
help our defese,[A] but would by no[N]
means halt the enemy.[A][N]
No matter what, I think we'll just[N]
have to hold out.[A][X]

##C26House2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier5]
I've got a status report on our[N]
enemy's weaponry.[A][N]
Their sages are using a tome that[N]
they call Annihilation.[A][N]
If they're allowed to strike with it,[N]
it will certainly kill its target.[A][N]
However, that sheer power is also[N]
its main weakness;[A] Annihilation is[N]
overwhelming to its user,[A][N]
and so even the act of arming oneself[N]
with it will render the user mute.[A][N]
The way I see it, if you want to[N]
live through this battle,[A][N]
you'll have to target those sages[N]
before their magic returns,[A][N]
lest Annihilation[...] annihilate.[A][X]


##C26AnnihilatorExplanation
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Interesting[...][A][N]
Annihilation's still unstable enough[N]
to wreak such havok on its users.[A][N]
I suppose our sages will need a moment[N]
to adjust to the tome's power.[A][N]
No matter. Once that moment passes,[N]
none shall survive our assault.[A][X]

##C26OlsenAppearance
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOlsen][ToggleSmile]
[...]A swell day for a great battle.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Bit of a bummer to have to fight against[N]
the losing side, though.[A][N]
That's like kicking a dog when it's down.[N]
And I like dogs.[A][N]
[...]Well. Should probably at least try[N]
to stab something.[A] Keep my reputation[N]
up, and all that.[A][X]

##C26OlsenRecruit
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadOlsen]
You must be Blair, right?[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Pleased to meet you![N]
The name's Olsen.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]What?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
World-renowned assassin Olsen?[N]
Doesn't ring a bell?[A][N]
[...]Rats. Then again, you seem a[N]
bit young to need an assassin[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Assassin?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Right. Technically, I'm[N]
supposed to kill you now.[A][N]
But I've snuck a look at some[N]
of my client's records.[A][N]
And now I'm on shaky moral[N]
grounds with her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're an assassin.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
An assassin with a heart![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, do you have any suggestions?[N]
It'd feel rude to kill you now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How much would it be to hire you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]A bidding war for my services?[N]
How exciting![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] wouldn't call it that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Oh. [...]Well[...] How about instead of[N]
money, you give me a fun title?[A][N]
[...]Ser Duke-Duchess Olsen von Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Are you quite sure that you're[N]
a real asssassin?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very. I have killed before,[N]
and will kill again.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I just also know how to enjoy[N]
the small things.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]I see. [...]We need everything[N]
we can take against Dalst.[A][N]
Welcome to the team, Ser[N]
Duke-Duchess Olsen von Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course, boss. Just point me at[N]
what you want to stop breathing.[A][X]

##C26EthylBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You will fall just as they did.[A][N]
One by one. Swiftly.[A][N]
All for the sake of our[N]
ideal world.[A][N]
[...]Really, this is an honor.[N]
The best way to die.[A][N]
Know that your life had[N]
some manner of meaning.[A][X]

##C26EthylDalstianBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
It's too late for you.[A][N]
You shall only be welcomed[N]
back unto Dalst in death.[A][N]
But do not fear. You will[N]
finally mean something.[A][X]

##C26EthylBlairBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
You stand complicit in the[N]
crimes against Aercolyn.[A][N]
There is nothing more I[N]
have to say to you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Crimes? You're quite[N]
presumptuous, child.[A][N]
And whether or not our[N]
actions are moral,[A][N]
I won't let you end[N]
these thirteen years.[A][N]
Begone, and let Dalst's[N]
glorious future take hold![A][X]

##C26EthylZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Prince of Elba Cor.[N]
You stand against Dalst.[A][N]
I won't hesitate to reduce[N]
you to nothingness.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
And I won't hesitate to fight[N]
for what I know is right.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Throw away your life, then.[N]
Make a martyr of yourself.[A][N]
You won't have meant a thing.[A][X]

##C26EthylArinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]The Valkyrie.[A] You went missing[N]
right as I joined Jraeyan.[A][N]
Always stung a bit. Not being[N]
a part of such a project.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Is that all anyone is[N]
to you? A curiosity?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You're far more than a[N]
curiosity, Valkyrie.[A][N]
You're an ideal. A legend.[N]
[...]A threat to me.[A][N]
And so, you must fall.[A][X]

##C26EthylKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The prodigal son returns.[A][N]
How's the blood on your hands[N]
feel? It's never coming off.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
That's quite rich, coming[N]
from someone like you.[A][N]
You, Girard, my father[...][A][N]
You're all stains upon the[N]
nation of Dalst.[A][N]
And if it takes killing all[N]
of you to remedy its sins,[A][N]
so be it.[A][N]
Now, then. I believe it is[N]
time for you to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Insolent.[A][N]
We aim to build something[N]
truly grand,[A] and you wish[N]
to burn it all to the ground.[A][N]
That is a sin most unforgivable.[N]
And now, you will die.[A][X]

##C26EthylDesmondBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
Lady of Ciraweiss![A][N]
You have brought tremendous[N]
sorrow to Aercolyn![A][N]
On my honor as the commander[N]
of Aercolyn's finest,[A][N]
I will strike you down![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The finest among you is not[N]
a fraction of our worst man.[A][N]
I shall end you, and let[N]
those who remain surrender.[A][N]
Everybody you knew will die[N]
to sate our curiosity.[A][N]
And you will be the first[N]
to die.[A] Farewell.[A][X]

##C26EthylEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Elcorian's told me much[N]
about you, Emile.[A][N]
Shame for you that you haven't[N]
returned to his side.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][CloseEyes]
I[...] truly wish it is not[N]
too late for him.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But I will stand for what[N]
I know to be just and right.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The only person it's too[N]
late for is you.[A][N]
He might not like it, but[N]
I'll just say it's a cost.[A][N]
A cost of changing the world.[A][X]

##C26EthylJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Know your damned place,[N]
subject.[A] Don't think you[N]
mean anything now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
[...]I[...] I will kill you.[A][N]
For all you have brought[N]
upon us.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
No. I will kill you.[A][N]
And you will become our[N]
next masterpiece.[A][X]

##C26EthylPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You had everything you[N]
needed, guard.[A][N]
And you squandered it for[N]
nobody insurgents.[A][N]
Really, you only have yourself[N]
to blame for what's happening.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
You're wrong.[A][N]
You[...] You hurt my friends.[A][N]
It's only right for me[N]
to fight for them.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Then die in the name of[N]
your vengeance.[A][N]
Just know that it's[N]
all your fault.[A][X]

##C26EthylHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Horatio. I remember you[N]
quite vividly.[A][N]
Shame you're still alive.[N]
I can fix that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Nay. I shall be the one[N]
to remedy my errors.[A][N]
I shall end your life.[N]
Scatter it about the winds.[A][N]
Bards will sing glorious[N]
ballads of my triumph![A][N]
And perhaps the darkness[N]
to which I am host[...][A][N]
Perhaps it will be satiated.[A][N]
And if not, I can tear down[N]
everything you stood for.[A][N]
How does that sound?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]I like the sound of me[N]
killing you better.[A][X]

##C26EthylSimoneBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Good to see you well, Ethyl.[A][N]
But I'm not here to talk[N]
small, as you can guess.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You were truly one of our[N]
finest, Simone.[A][N]
What does this betrayal stand[N]
to leave you with?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
I think you've long[N]
misinterpreted me.[A][N]
Everything I've ever done[N]
was for my own sake.[A][N]
Once, sticking around with[N]
Jraeyan was what I needed.[A][N]
Now, it isn't.[A][N]
What more do you want me[N]
to say?[A] Yesterday's done.[N]
Today's what's happening.[A][N]
And today, you're in my way.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Well, then. These years[N]
meant nothing to you.[A][N]
And so, they mean nothing[N]
to me.[A] [...]Die, Georgios.[A][X]

##C26EthylElizaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Begone, child.[A][N]
This field's no place[N]
for someone like you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
You're[...] You're wrong.[A][N]
You're the lady of my state,[N]
and yet[...][A] You've done[N]
so many awful things.[A][N]
I[...] I can't back down.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The child wishes to tarnish[N]
the Ciraweiss name?[A][N]
Well, then. I'll make this[N]
fun. Farewell, child.[A][X]

##C26EthylDirkBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
[...]Lady Ciraweiss.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
I suppose you know me.[A][N]
Well, I don't know you.[A][N]
You are nothing but an[N]
obstacle in my path.[A][N]
Now, then. Burn.[A][X]

##C26EthylClarqueBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[...]I saw you. At Jraeyan.[A][N]
You're the one who was[N]
behind the slaughter.[A][N]
I was[...] too weak. Too scared.[N]
Too pathetic to stop it.[A][N]
But I won't falter now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You cared for those mercs?[A][N]
Shame, I guess. They were[N]
a necessary sacrifice.[A][N]
[...]And it wasn't my idea.[A][N]
But I'm sure you don't care[N]
about those specifics.[A][N]
If you want to kill me, try.[N]
You'll fail.[A] But maybe it'll[N]
make you feel better.[A][X]

##C26EthylOlsenBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss][CloseEyes]
[...]For the love of[...][A][N]
Why'd I pick the worst[N]
assassin on the continent?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOlsen]
I take offense to that.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I'll demonstrate my skills[N]
firsthand, if you'd wish![A][N][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]No matter. I hardly needed[N]
you anyway.[A] You were simply[N]
a failsafe.[A] And now you're[N]
target practice.[A][X]

##C26EthylSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Surveil? Here?[A][N]
[...]Almost gets me nostalgic.[A][N]
Best thing to come out of[N]
Jraeyan, honestly.[A][N]
Shame I'll have to put it[N]
down like this,[A] but maybe[N]
this is the excuse I need.[A][N]
Take it apart, study it,[N]
build it again better.[A][N]
[...]I like the sound of that.[A][X]

##C26EthylDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Power[...][N]
Too[...] much power[...][A][N]
How in the hell[...][N]
have you gotten[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
No[...] matter[...][A][N]
This will never[...] end[...][A][N]
He will[...] never[...][N]
let[...] it[...] end[...][A][X]

##C26EthylKillsBlair
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I[...] Everyone[...][N]
I'm[...] sorry[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You could've stood alongside[N]
us.[A] But it's too late for[N]
what-ifs now.[A][N]
Farewell, Aercolyn.[A][X]

##C26EthylKillsZeke
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
I[...] know that[...][N]
I wasn't wrong[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Tell yourself that.[N]
But look at who's alive.[A][N]
And look at who shall die[N]
in the name of our world.[A][X]

##Ch26_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungEthyl]
Should I be concerned for you?[A][N]
Don't think your absences have[N]
gone unnoticed, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Jraeyan's been under our control[N]
for[...] What, three years now?[A][N]
And has anything substantial[N]
come of it?[A] One iota that[N]
justifies their crimes?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not as of yet.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know you put a lot on the line[N]
with them.[A] But I think it's[N]
better we cut our losses.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look at the bigger picture.[A][N]
We let them go free, they find[N]
themselves another stronghold,[A][N]
and they're back to doing what[N]
they did with Sinclair.[A][N]
I am[...] Dalst is keeping them[N]
in check.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is this truly simpler than just[N]
killing them and being done with it?[A][N]
It's harsh, but it would be over[N]
and done with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] want to believe that their[N]
knowledge can better Ulmaron.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Guess that's what separates us.[N]
You will never let this end.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]I understand where you're coming[N]
from.[A] You've put far too much into[N]
this place. Met some smart people.[A][N]
You don't want to lose that.[A][N]
So you keep digging yourself[N]
deeper.[A] [...]And I can't say[N]
I don't get it.[A][N]
I wouldn't want to admit I've wasted[N]
three years of my life either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd hardly say it was wasted.[A][N]
Just that[...] our goals are[N]
long-term.[A][N]
[...]I do truly need your assistance.[A][N]
You've one of the finest[N]
minds around.[A][N]
And you're the only other in[N]
Dalst who knows of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn it. Fine.[A][N]
[...]Wait, you still haven't[N]
told Elcorian of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] hasn't come up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've never a thought you haven't[N]
immediately told him.[A][N]
[...]Are you trying to protect him[N]
from this? From you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] In fact, maybe[N]
it IS about time he knew.[A][N]
But enough of that. Let you[N]
and I return to what we know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of course, old friend.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] know this hasn't all[N]
been a waste.[A][N]
All our understanding is to[N]
create a glorious future.[A][X]
