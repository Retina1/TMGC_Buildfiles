Ah! What're you doin' back here?[N]
This was supposed to be a secret![A][N]
Well, I guess while you're here,[N]
I could let loose a few tidbits[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Don't go tellin' others, though![N]
Now, let's see here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've got it! I'll let ya' know how[N]
to find all the secret units![A][N]
If you wanna find them yourself,[N]
turn off the game console now![A][N]
First up's Addington, the automaton![N]
He's for sale in Chapter 12x.[A][N]
Interact with the cracked tile[N]
near the staircase to buy him.[A][N]
As for Tonnamin, the wayward brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, I'm not sure yet. Come back later.[A][N]
Third is Laronde, the devoted brother![N]
Man, there's a lot of brothers[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
For him, make sure the young mage Rose[N]
survives the events of Viridian Arc.[A][N]
He's sure to join you then![A][N]
Lastly, there's Jonas, the Yg'stran[N]
wyvern rider. He's the hardest.[A][N]
In Chapter 10, you gotta beat Lazarus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
while making sure Jonas lives![A][N]
Once you beat Laz, Jonas will retreat[N]
to live another day, and one day[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, he'll find himself in your army![A][N]
That's all the advice I have for you.[N]
