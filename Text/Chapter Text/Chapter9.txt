Blimey[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thar be pirates.[N]
Attackin' a poor Opistian boat.[A][N]
Welp, guess we're goin' around.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I could hardly do that, captain![N]
We need to help them![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Arr, fine. These do be my seas,[N]
after all. Gotta show them who's boss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How do you expect us to fight?[N]
We can't just walk on water.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry about those details.[A][N]
My boys'll get planks rigged and anchored[N]
faster than ye can think.[A][N]

##Ch9_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadApollo][OpenFarRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
It seems the pirates are retreating.[N]
I think that's it for now.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah, most excellent! Unfortunately,[N]
I believe our vessel was trashed.[A][N]
Our little band shant be going[N]
anywhere at this rate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, as I said earlier, you're free[N]
to travel with us.[A] We're headed[N]
to Opistia, ourselves.[A][N][OpenRight]
Would that truly be all right?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, lad. We gots the room, and[N]
we can't just leave ya adrift.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, we could. But the[N]
lass may not approve o' that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm still here, captain.[A][N][OpenRight]
If need be, I'll continue to fight[N]
for you.[A] It's only right, given[N]
that you fought for my companions.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yeah, yeah. Get on wit' movin'.[N]

It seems the pirates are retreating.[N]
I think that's it for now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A job well done, lass. Say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What's our plan with those monks?[A][N]
From a quick look, their boat's in[N]
a bad shape. They won't be goin' nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd imagine they're Opistia bound.[A][N]
If we have the room, we should[N]
let them come with us.[A][N]
The other option would be leaving[N]
them floating at sea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The sea's a nice place.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I be jokin', lass.[N]

I'll get me boys to prepare to[N]
disembark on your word.[A][N]
We've got lots o' sea left to go.[A][X]

Excuse me, milady?[A][N]
The name's Apollo. I'm with the[N]
boat you protected.[A][N]
Thank you for that, by the way![A][N]
Anyway, we've got[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a bit of a problem.[N]
Our boat's trashed. We're going nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Would you like to travel[N]
with us?[A] We're headed[N]
to Opistia, ourselves.[A][N][OpenRight]
Would that truly be all right?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, lad. We gots the room, and[N]
we can't just leave ya adrift.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, we could. But the[N]

a fresh start.[A] If I do wanna[N]
repent, I've got holy men right here.[A][X]

##Ch9_Apollo_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
You, there! Are you here to help us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You could say that.[N]
Is everyone alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Unfortunately, we're the only[N]
ones left, now.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But your presence will at least[N]
help save those who remain.[A][N]
I'm Apollo, by the way.[N]
Wandering monk of Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nice to meet you. Does your[N]
crew want to evacuate to our boat?[A][N]
We should be able to keep you[N]
relatively safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It would be quite unbecoming of us[N]
to idly sit by like that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though once this battle is through,[N]
we'd appreciate that offer.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then. I'm Blair.[N]
If you're ready, let's go.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

serve faithfully.[A][X]

worst seas, 'cept you cannae sail away.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you do not like this life,[N]

If only it be that simple, bucko.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I just so happen to be in the[N]
company of a fine young lady.[A][N]
I'd imagine she needs all the[N]
strength she can get,[A][N]
and I trust her cause to be[N]
one of noble intent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sayin'[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] there still be[N]
a chance fer old me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Opistus tells us that for those who[N]
seek it, there will be salvation.[A][N]
