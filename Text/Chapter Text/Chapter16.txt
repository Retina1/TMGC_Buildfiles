##Ch16_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNeillstrom][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
What's the matter, Tarquin?[N]
You look[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] severe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Apologies. Those damned invaders[N]
gave my men the slip.[A][N]
Guess however they were able to warp in,[N]
they warped out just as easily.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's quite unfortunate. Do there appear[N]
to be other locations under attack?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm not quite sure, but I didn't see[N]
anything of value.[A][N]
I'll scout again, but if nothing's worth[N]
noting, I'm reporting to Dalst.[A][N]
You know how Lord Arbordia is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Thank you for your assistance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Who[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is behind this?[N]
He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He must know the answers.[A][X]

##Ch16_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We've lost our lead.[A][N]
We could blindly chase them,[N]
but that's quite the risk.[A][N]
Unfortunately, information on Holanis[N]
is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sparse.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I've got an idea.[A][N]
Do you know of the Elba Cor Archives?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The what?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's something most nobility's heard of.[A][N]
A library dedicated to chronicling the[N]
continent's history.[A][N]
We might be able to find information[N]
on Holanis there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's about as good[N]
an idea as any.[A][N]
I presume if you bring it up,[N]
it's in the capital somewhere?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Technically, it's just outside Couria,[N]
but it's close enough.[A][N]
Shall we depart then?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Lead the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How could I not know of something as[N]
simple yet important as this?[A][N]
What else about my home am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
am I blind to?[A][X]

##Ch16_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
What's going on here? Why[N]
is it on fire?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This destruction isn't from[N]
any normal bandits[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Did Holanis have the same idea as us?[A][N]
Only, they'd wish to halt our progress[N]
by hiding the truth?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In any case, it's not too late yet.[A][N]
If we can clear them out quick enough,[N]
I'm sure we'll find some surviving records.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Everyone, prepare[N]
to face Holanis again.[A][N]
We've got no time for doubt![A][X]

##_Ch16SysText
Over time, books will emerge[N]
from the shelves,[A] and enemies[N]
will move to attack them.[A][N]
Books being destroyed will[N]
not cause a game over.[A][N]
You will get rewarded based[N]
on how many books survive,[A][N]
with the best rewards given for[N]
letting two or fewer books fall.[A][N]
If the turn limit expires,[N]
it's game over.[A][X]

##C16NicoleBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
What a strange job. Least[N]
they're payin' me well.[A][N]
And I get to cut through some[N]
goons like you. That's fun.[A][X]

##C16NicoleArtemisBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Well, well, well. What're[N]
you doin' on their side?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
It's clear to me. This is[N]
a meaningless fight.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Perhaps from your point of view.[N]
But me? This is my big break.[A][N]
I finish this job, and Holanis'll[N]
pay a king's ransom.[A][N]
It's a shame to have to kill you.[N]
Truly. I liked you.[A][N]
But, hey. At least it'll be easy.[A][X]

##C16NicoleDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Damn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I underestimated[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
was for naught[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
