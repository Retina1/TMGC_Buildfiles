##I2_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Well, here we are. Kionius,[N]
the capital of Mevion.[A][N]
Thankfully, Peggy was right-[N]
we don't really stick out anymore.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What do we do, now that we're here?[N]
We can't stay here forever.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's where we run into problems.[A][N]
We're foreigners, so I'm not even clear[N]
on governmental procedure here,[A][N]
and assuming we get an audience with the[N]
parliament,[A] there's no guarantee we'd even[N]
get any assistance.[A] At the same time...[N]
what other choice do we have?[A][N]
But enough of that. Yg'stra's seemingly given[N]
up on chasing us, so we've room to breathe.[A][N]
I think after everything we've been through,[N]
a short break is in order.[A][N]
Plus, our supplies are likely in need[N]
of restocking.[A][N]
Now's a better time than ever to just[N]
take a moment and take in the scenery.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course... That all makes sense.[N]
No time like the present, then.[A][N]
Prepare to advance![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...This isn't a real battle, Blair.[N]
But I'll humor you.[A][X]
