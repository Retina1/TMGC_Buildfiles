I fall[...] amidst my passion.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I thank thee, Opistus[...][N]
It is[...] a great end[...][A][CloseEyes][X]
##Tale3LarondeDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
Archbishop[...] Forgive me[...][N]
Look after[...] my family[...][A][CloseEyes][X]
##Tale3RoseDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadRose]
Laronde[...] I[...] really[...][N]
I really messed up[...][A][CloseEyes][X]

##Tale3AthenaDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]

##Tale3WyvernDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
No! Blast it[...] It wasn't[N]
supposed to be like this[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
You[...] poor creature[...][A][X]

##Tale3Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRose][OpenLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadVladmir][OpenFarRight][LoadLaronde][OpenRight]
Wonderful work today, friends.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Not bad, kid.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Could[...] Could you please[N]
not encourage her?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
No, do.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, if she's asking for it[...][A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[...]Goodness.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us keep our spirits[N]
high on this day.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadAthena]
[...]Archbishop. Behind you.[A][N][OpenRight]
Pardon?[A][X]

##Tale3Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadVladmir]
Oh? What do we have here?[A][N]
Another wyvern?[A][N]
You[...] You don't quite look[N]
like any I've seen today.[A][N]
What's the matter, friend?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadLaronde]
A-Archbishop! Stand back![A][N][OpenLeft]
Peace, young one. This wyvern[N]
doesn't mean me any harm.[A][N]
If it did, I'd be a crisp already.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]If you're sure.[N]
Stay safe.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][OpenRight]
Are you alright, friend?[A][N]
You seem unwell.[A][N][OpenLeft][LoadAthena]
[...]It appears there's something[N]
embedded in its back.[A][N][OpenRight]
So there is. Thank you, Athena.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry, friend. This may sting[N]
a little, but it'll help you.[A][N][MoveMidRight]
[...]The tip of a sword. Poor thing.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Opistus[...] Hear my call.[N]
Bring upon your repose.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]It is done. Peace, friend.[A][X]

##Tale3Ending3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLaronde][OpenLeft][LoadAthena][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]That's[...] the most at peace[N]
I've ever seen a wyvern.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It puts most riders I've[N]
ever known to shame.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You can fly off now, friend.[A][N]
[...]Are you alright?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I[...] I think it wishes[N]
to stay with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you sure, friend?[A][N]
You've a land of freedom[N]
down here.[A] Do you wish[N]
to give up on that?[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadManfred]
I wonder if it understood[N]
the kindness you showed.[A][N]
That'd be remarkable for[N]
a beast like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you truly do wish to join us,[N]
I believe you will need a name.[A][N]
Judging by your patterning, I'd[N]
have to assume you're a male[...][A][N]
[...]How does the name Wendell sound?[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]You appear to like that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadRose]
That's a bit of a goofy name[N]
for a dragon.[A] [...]Not bad.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't promise you'll enjoy the[N]
Opistian sands.[A] But I'll do what[N]
I can to make them welcoming.[A][N]
[...]Let us return in joy, friends.[A][X]

##Tale3Opening
[OpenFarLeft][LoadManfred][OpenLeft][LoadAthena][OpenRight][LoadVladmir][OpenFarRight][LoadLaronde][OpenRight]
I believe we're here,[N]
my dearest friends.[A][N]
You all remember what[N]
our purpose today is?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Absolutely! Today's a momentous[N]
day for your wyvern research.[A][N]
There's[...] What, three nests?[N]
All in this one valley?[A][N]
Truly astounding.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I must agree. Though not my[N]
expertise,[A] I'm not enough of[N]
a fool to pass this by.[A][N]
Fascinating beasts and a respite[N]
from the desert heat[...][A][N]
A worthwhile pursuit for sure.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Your plan was for me to approach[N]
the nests to draw them out, correct?[A][N][OpenRight]
Correct. That band I gave you should[N]
help hasten your friend's wingbeats.[A][N]
Once a wyvern's been sighted, I shall[N]
pacify it with one of my staves.[A][N]
You still have the backup supply[N]
on hand, Laronde?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That I do. If you need one,[N]
just let me know.[A][N][OpenRight]
Excellent. Once I've pacified a[N]
beast, I shall examine it.[A][N]
We shall be on our way without[N]
mortally wounding the beasts.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Certainly a more humane way to[N]
study than some scholars.[A][N]
[...]I know I'm mainly here as[N]
hired hands,[A] in case we run[N]
into some local ruffians,[A][N]
but what about the girl?[A][N][OpenRight]
Pardon? Do you mean Athena?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
No, the little one.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
The[...] little[...][A][CloseEyes]
[...]Rose. Get out here.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadRose][ToggleSmile]
Hi.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What are you doing here?[A][N]
This[...] This isn't safe[N]
for you! Not one bit![A][N][OpenRight]
Peace, young one. We shall[N]
keep her unharmed.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Kinda surprised you missed her.[A][N]
She's been throwing sparks around[N]
the whole trip here.[A][N]
[...]If you wanna throw some at[N]
the bad guys, fine by me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hehe. Take that, Moronde![A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Alright. Just[...][N]
Stay close, Rose.[A][N]
I hear someone coming.[A][N][OpenRight]
Stay composed, everyone.[A][N]
He shall protect and enlighten[N]
us on this glorious day![A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern1Spawn
[OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
A wyvern has emerged from[N]
the north mountain.[A][N]
[...]It appears to have drawn[N]
some unaffiliated cavalry.[A][N]
Do as you will, Archbishop.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir]
Thank you.[A][N]
[...]I think I shall study this[N]
one's wings extra throughly.[A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern1Talk
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
[...]Those wings are a true beauty[N]
among your kind, friend.[A][N]
So very robust, and yet the most[N]
tender I've seen in years.[A][N]
[...]Thank you, my friend.[A][N]
I shall not disturb you[N]
any further,[A] and nor[N]
shall these ruffians.[A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern2Spawn
[OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
A wyvern has emerged from[N]
the west mountain.[A][N]
[...]It seems some unaffiliated[N]
fliers have emerged as well.[A][N]
Do as you will, Archbishop.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir]
Thank you.[A][N]
[...]If I have one asleep anyway,[N]
perhaps I shall peer into its jaws.[A][N]
Perhaps there's a hint of these[N]
noble beasts' diets.[A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern2Talk
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
[...]Do pardon me.[A][MoveMidRight] [...]Hm[...] Nothing[N]
remnant within your teeth.[A][N]
[...]A light tuft of fur upon[N]
your nose, however.[A][N]
If I had to venture from the[N]
color, perhaps that of a bear.[A][N]
How incredibly fascinating![A][N]
[...]Thank you, my friend.[A][N]
I shall not disturb you[N]
any further,[A] and nor[N]
shall these ruffians.[A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern3Spawn
[OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
A wyvern has emerged from[N]
the east mountain.[A][N]
[...]It seems some bow riders[N]
are mobilizing as well.[A][N]
Do as you will, Archbishop.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir]
Thank you.[A][N]
[...]I see you've got quite the[N]
majestic scale patterning.[A][N]
I do wish to study it up close.[A][X]

##Tale3Wyvern3Talk
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
[...]I could've sworn your scales[N]
were a silver most sterling.[A][N]
And yet, upon my coming closer,[N]
they take on a lustrous azure.[A][N]
Perhaps it's a trick of the light.[A][N]
Perhaps it's a trick to bring[N]
confusion upon your prey.[A][N]
[...]Thank you, my friend.[A][N]
I shall not disturb you[N]
any further,[A] and nor[N]
shall these ruffians.[A][X]

##Tale3IntoEnd
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
I'm satisfied, companions.[A][N]
Let us take our leave, and not[N]
disturb these beasts further.[A][X]

##Tale3SleepRefresh
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
Need another staff? Sure thing.[N]
Just give me[...] one moment[...][A][N][MoveMidRight]
Here[...] you go. I've got more[N]
to spare, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, young one.[A][X]
