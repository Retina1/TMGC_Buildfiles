Damien, my boy! It's good[N]
to see ya![A] How've things[N]
been, bud?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good, good. Restored a prince.[N]
Unearthed a conspiracy.[A][N]
And there was this REALLY[N]
big bear I nabbed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Wish I could've seen that.[A][N]
Anyway, you asked why I'm 'ere.[A][N]
Basically, Yg'stra called me[N]
outta retirement.[A][N]
The nerve o' them.[A][N]
You've fallen in wit' a good[N]
bunch, right?[A] You've got[N]
good judgement with that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd like to think they're good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Make some room[N]
for good ol' Tobias![A][N]
It beats fightin' for a land[N]
that doesn't know to stop.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

You've gotten strong, I see.[A][N]
Any stories for this old man?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lots, Uncle. I'll tell ya[N]

Speakin' of great things, I've[N]

Adventure, you say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I need me that.[A][N]
Can ya promise me some quality[N]

A worthy opponent, for one[N]
such as I.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I've seen[N]
you around before.[A][N]
Years back, during a military[N]
exercise with Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
A legendary lancer of[N]

Would you be her?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've long aspired to your skill.[N]
It's truly beyond compare.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But enough of that.[N]
Be on your guard.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You don't wish to fight me.[N]
And I'd rather not be here myself.[A][N]
That man[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Tarquin. He's been[N]
a pox upon Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're a reasonable man.[N]
I can tell.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And you respect my talent.[N]
I quite appreciate that.[A][N]
So, I'll lend a hand.[A][N]
All I want[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] All everyone in[N]
Yg'stra wants[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
is a return to normal.[A][N]
And that path goes across[N]
that man's grave.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you're sure, we'll[N]
gladly accept your help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

##C23MikeyRecruitsSonia

I could ask that of you.[N]

It's a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] long story.[A][N]
But my friends and I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
We're fighting Tarquin.[A][N]
I know you. You must loathe him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you suggest I join you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I'd rather not fight you.[N]
I know how that'd end.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Smart kid. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course I'll[N]

No other way about it, obviously.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You do not wish to back down.[N]
Unfortunate, young lady.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I can't back down. Not now,[N]
after learning what I know.[A][N]
Surely, you wouldn't stand[N]
for it either.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
I never pretended to[N]
understand Arbordia.[A][N]
I've always understood[N]
conflict and control,[A] and that[N]
has served me enough this far.[A][N]
Maybe it's shortsighted,[A][N]
but I'm not throwing away[N]
these years.[A][N]
Arbordia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, Girard. He's[N]
earned my trust.[A][N]
My respect. All you've done is[N]
scamper around the continent.[A][N]

##C23TarquinKennethBattle

I taught you better than that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I wouldn't know. I'm not our[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Show me what you've learned.[A][N]
Show me how you wear the[N]

I'll do you one better.[A][N]

Plus, you've threatened[N]

Sins of my land?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elba Cor spent a decade[N]
wasting away.[A][N]
Mevion's a closed off hive[N]
of villainy and scum.[A][N]
Yg'stra's a lawless purgatory.[N]
Need I go on?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
The whole world's a flawed place.[N]

Don't count us out yet,[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure you don't wish[N]
for the army to escort you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is alright. It's my duty alone[N]
to confront those in Holanis.[A][N]
Those with ties to Sinclair.[A][N]
Their power is unfathomable, and[N]
I'd rather not risk your life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And for the sake of Dalst, you[N]
probably shouldn't risk yours.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If worst comes to[N]
worst,[A] Ciraweiss is next[N]
in line to control Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lord Ciraweiss? Isn't he[N]
quite along in years?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More than likely at this point,[N]
Ethyl would run things.[A][N]
She's already essentially taken[N]
control of her own state's affairs.[A][N]
In any case, I hardly plan on dying.[N]
Have at least some faith, Tarquin.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, sir. Safe travels.[A][X]

What are you doing out here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Lord Arbordia instructed me to lead[N]
the Yg'stran remnants here.[A][N]
Some manner of loyalty-building[N]
exercise, I suppose.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unusual. In any case,[N]
we've dire findings.[A][N]
Dalst's entwined in conspiracy[N]
within the Holanian wilds.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. What do you[N]
intend to do?[A][N][OpenRight]
Bring it to light, of course.[A][N]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are you implying?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So he was right.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The sentencing shall begin.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sentencing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Girard feared that you'd turn[N]
traitor to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Surrender yourself now,[N]
and I will make this quick.[A][N][OpenRight]
Absolutely not![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. I suppose this can[N]
be that Yg'stran exercise.[A][N]
Know that in forfeiting a swift[N]
and noble execution,[A][N]
you've damned yourself and your friends to[N]
a miserable end to these lawless savages.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But perhaps this will be what they[N]
need to be brought to order.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And if you fell them, you'll[N]
still fall before me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In the distance. They're coming.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So this is what Dalst[N]
has come to.[A][N]
It's decided, then.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Lord Neillstrom must fall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to agree.[N]
Shocking as it is.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] will that be enough?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'd hope[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But if it's the Yg'strans[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They're sure to be organized.[A][N]
We'll just have to find anyone who[N]
looks important,[A] and dismantle[N]
their chain of command.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Very well. Once we do this,[N]
there's truly no turning back.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
We have to do this for[N]
the future of Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not just Dalst.[N]
For[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all of Ulmaron.[A][X]
