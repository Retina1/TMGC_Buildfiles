##I3_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Well, lassie[...] The winds're favorin'[N]
us. We're making good time to Opistia.[A][N]
I'd guess we're another four or five days[N]
out at most.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So, what be your plan, anyway?[N]
Draggin' Opistia into this war?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] not quite how I'd phrase it.[A][N]
But I suppose you could see it that way.[A][N]
While the Opistians are normally a[N]
pacifistic nation,[A] they've historically[N]
stepped in during major conflicts.[A][N]
I'd call the Yg'stran invasion worthy[N]
of their consideration.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I suppose. Never been one for politics[N]
meself.[A] All o' my disputes are settled[N]
either with a sip o' ale or a good clubbin'.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You could just call this war[N]
a large scale [OpenQuote]clubbin'.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It be more complex, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]We've nothin' better to do.[N]
I'd say give yer allies a holler.[A][N]
Dependin' on how the cards fall, these may be[N]
yer last peaceful moments for a long while.[A][N]
I'm sure everyone's got a lot on[N]
their minds.[A] That's what I do wit'[N]
me crew, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good idea, captain.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]
(If I remember correctly, there's also[N]
some pirate-run shops on this boat.)[A][N]
(It wouldn't hurt to see what[N]
they have available.)[A][X]

##I3ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Ye good wit' yer mates, lass?[A][X]

##I3NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
Not quite yet, captain.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Aye. I get ya.[N]
Go then, and be merry.[A][X]

##I3ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
I believe so.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, then. Shall ye gaze o'er[N]
the vast horizon?[A][N]
The seas always help to clear[N]
me mind after a long voyage.[A][X]

##I3Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
It's truly marvelous, captain.[N]
Almost makes one feel insignificant.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh. Never thought o' it like that.[A][N]
I guess ye can see forever here.[N]
[...]And there be a lot to see.[A][N]
We all find somethin' different.[A][N]
I always saw it as a vast land of promise.[A][N]
A land that challenges me to leave[N]
my mark on it, in any way I can.[A][N]
But, hey. As I said, that be her real[N]
beauty. The meaning ye find in it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
There's a comfort in knowing that[N]
no matter what,[A] your worries are[N]
meaningless in the grand scheme.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Aye.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Did you mean what you said[N]
back in town?[A] That I didn't need[N]
to help you back at Loile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That? Course, lass. Why would[N]
I lie to ya?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Then what was the point?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well, if ye weren't gonna deny[N]
me, why say no ta free help?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Someone knows how ta make[N]
a guy feel bad.[A][N]
[...]But, 'ey. Let that be teach[N]
ya somethin', lass.[A][N]
You don't gotta fight everyone's[N]
battles for them.[A][N]
You don't gotta prove yourself[N]
to everyone ya meet.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well, I made the lass mad at me.[N]
Mateys! Put Cid outta his misery![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[...] alright. I[...] really have been[N]
doing everyone's dirty work.[A][N]
Not just for you. But for Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Rubbin' salt in the wound, lass.[A][N]
[...]But I guess I should've been more[N]
honest wit' ye.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
You're starting now. I think that[N]
counts for something, captain.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ye think too 'ighly o' me, lass.[N]
But thanks.[A][OpenEyes] [...]'nough mopin'.[N]
I got navigatin' ta do.[A][N]
A bright path to chart.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]And maybe I need to chart[N]
a path more my own.[A][X]

##I3ArinConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Ah, Blair. How are you[N]
holding up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well, all things considered.[N]
It's been an exhausting road.[A][N]
But you'd know that.[N]
[...]Thanks for all of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm hardly the only reason[N]
you've made it this far.[A][N]
Don't undersell your own skills,[N]
both on and off the battlefield.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But that's the thing! You're a greater[N]
fighter than I could ever be,[A][N]
AND you've practically been my[N]
tactician![A] I owe everything[N]
up to this point to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
If you insist.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Anyway, if you haven't yet,[N]
you should check in on the others.[A][N]
As always, it's great to see you.[A][X]

##I3KennethConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Hm[...] Perhaps us Dalstians would have much[N]
to gain from allying with southern pirates.[A][N]
[...]Then again, this Cid's quite[N]
the rare breed of man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not everything needs to be some[N]
political power play, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose that's a fair point.[N]
Besides, what WOULD we gain out of it?[A][N]
Much of Dalst's trade is either overland[N]
or through warp magic.[A] And a sea-based[N]
invasion is quite unlikely.[A][N]
It'd just be[...] a truce for those[N]
rare moments we'd need the sea.[A][N]
Not an unvaluable resource, but one[N]
at a steep cost for little benefit.[A][N]
Keeping pirates on one's side sounds[N]
like a fool's errand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And yet Elba Cor's got a good[N]
thing going.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I said. Cid's different.[A][N]
When I said it's a fool's errand,[N]
I never specified WHO the fool was.[A][N]
The man has immense sway over the[N]
king, yet squanders it.[A][N]
Of course, there may be factors of[N]
which I am unaware,[A] but as it[N]
stands, it's puzzling.[A][N]
Just the way I see it, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps what you need is a bit[N]
more faith in people.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Whatever you say, Blair. I'm here to[N]
help make sure your back stays unstabbed.[A][X]

##I3KennethDefUp
Kenneth's defense[N]
increased by 1![A][X]

##I3NatasiaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
Fancy seeing you here, Blair![N]
What's up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just checking in. How have[N]
you been, Natasia?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been splendid! It's been a[N]
wild ride getting here,[A] and[N]
I live for that.[A][N]
To be frank, my village[...][N]
It's great, of course.[A][N]
But it's not really what[N]
I'd call exciting.[A][N]
Who knew that you turning up nearby[N]
would result in[...] all of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes][...]It still doesn't feel right, dragging[N]
you all along like this[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You don't get it, Blair.[N]
There's nowhere I'd rather be![A][N]
It had been far too long since I'd[N]
last seen you, and hey![A][N]
This is as good an excuse as[N]
any to stick around.[A][N]
Wouldn't want you dyin' without me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
I'm[...] glad to hear that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You should be! I'll keep you[N]
alive, one way or another![A][X]

##I3NatasiaResUp
Natasia's resistance[N]
increased by 2![A][X]

##I3StefanConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Milady! Have you been keeping well?[N]
It's truly an honor to see you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I should be saying that to you, Stefan.[N]
You've been such a valuable ally![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You flatter me, milady.[N]
But I'm just doing my duty.[A][N]
I know I can push myself further[N]
and serve us all the better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you say so. Just don't[N]
overdo it, please.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No promises, milady![A][N]
Anyway, I'm off to run four hundred[N]
laps around the deck of the ship![A][N]
A pleasure seeing you![A][X]

##I3StefanSpeedUp
Stefan's speed[N]
increased by 2![A][X]

##I3DesmondConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
Greetings, milady.[N]
How do you fare?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've been quite alright.[N]
What about you, Desmond?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been well, considering[N]
recent events.[A][N]
There's a reason I'm your commander.[N]
I handle challenges well.[A][N]
Adaptability has been the key[N]
these past few weeks.[A][N]
Never thought I'd have to fight[N]
in swamps, or on a volcano.[A][N]
Or on a boat.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You sound more surprised about[N]
the boat than the volcano.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Yeah. Again. Challenging[N]
couple of weeks.[A][N]
Clearly it's getting to me.[A][N][OpenEyes]
It also doesn't help that I've been[N]
without a horse for a while now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Maybe we'll get lucky?[N]
You'll find your horse again?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I won't hold my breath, milady.[A][X]

##I3SamConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
[MoveMidRight]And[...] there! I[...] think my[N]
aim's getting better?[A][N]
[...]Wha[...] Blair! I-I didn't notice you![N]
I'm just[...] practicing my archery.[A][N]
It's nothing remarkable[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd hardly say that. You're a[N]
valuable member of this army![A][N][OpenMidRight]
R-Really? [...]You're n-not just[N]
saying that, r-right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course not![A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I'm[...] glad to hear that.[N]
B-But I'm still[...] not good enough[...][A][N]
That's why[...] I have to keep[N]
pushing myself[...][A][N]
To become someone that[N]
I[...] can be proud of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Very well. Just know that[N]
you're doing great as is.[A][X]

##I3JosefConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Greetings! How goes it, milady?[N]
Is this boat treating you well?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As well as you'd expect.[N]
How have you been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Frankly, I'm torn. On one hand,[N]
this relative peace has been lovely.[A][N]
I've heard it's what true warriors[N]
strive for, and they have a point.[A][N]
On the other hand, I don't want[N]
to get rusty,[A] lest my guard[N]
fail you at the worst of times.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Have you asked any of Cid's[N]
men to spar with you?[A][N]
Training against axe users[N]
may be fortuitous.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah[...] About that. They all[...][N]
ran off when I suggested that.[A][N]
Wonder if they saw me cleaning up[N]
Pete's gang and got scared.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
When you say [OpenQuote]cleaning up,[CloseQuote][N]
you mean[...]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Just[...] taking them down.[N]
[...]And maybe taking their gold.[A][N]
The way I see it, their ill-gotten gains[N]
may as well serve a grander purpose.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Do Cid's men really think I'll[N]
snatch up their treasure like that?[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, then. Thanks for checking in.[A][X]

##I3PeggyConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Well, hello there, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How have you been holding up, Peggy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hard to say. On one hand, I hate[N]
boats with every fibre of my being.[A][N]
On the other hand, at least this[N]
isn't a boring adventure.[A][N]
Good work, keeping things interesting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're welcome? I mean, you're part[N]
of why we've made it this far.[A][N]
You're why we ended up in Kionius[N]
in the first place.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're damn right. I'm the true hero here.[A][N]
[...]I was just joking there, but[N]
saying that actually felt real good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] glad to hear?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look out, world! You can't stop me now.[A][X]

##I3PeggyStrengthUp
Peggy's strength[N]
increased by 2![A][X]

##I3ButchConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
[...]Hey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How have you held up, Butch?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Can't complain. I mean, I could.[N]
But that'd just be nitpicking.[A][N]
It's funny, really. One minute[N]
I'm clinging to Mevion,[A][N]
trying to get an iota of a glimpse[N]
of what I thought I felt.[A][N]
That fleeting feeling of fighting[N]
for a just cause. Like the revolution.[A][N]
I'd thought it lost forever, frankly.[A][N]
And yet, I think I'm starting to[N]
feel it again, fighting here.[A][N]
I don't know if Peggy told you[N]
anything of me.[A] She'd probably[N]
just talk about when I almost died.[A][N]
How she saved my life. And, yeah.[N]
I appreciate it.[A][N]
But in a way, your motley gang[N]
has saved me a second time.[A][N][CloseEyes]
So, you know. Not bad, for[N]
someone as young as you.[A][N]
Givin' me a reason to fight beyond[N]
just searching for said reason.[A][X]

##I3CassiusConvo
[OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Ah[...] The spray of the ocean.[N]
I could get used to this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Greetings, Cassius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wha[...]? Ah! Lady Blair! Don't go[N]
sneakin' up on me like that.[A][N]
[...]So, what do ya need, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was just[...] checking in.[N]
I heard you mention the ocean spray?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right[...] Yeah, it'll sound somewhat[N]
silly, coming from me,[A] but it's[N]
refreshing.[A][N]
Maybe it's just cause I rarely[N]
experience it, but it's nice.[A][N]
[...]You ever think about that?[N]
I know, me thinking. Terrifying.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, you're right. It is[...][N]
quite lovely.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes][...]Keep yourself well, milady.[N]
Opistus knows we need that.[A][N]
Meanwhile, I'll just[...][N]
think a little more.[A][X]

##I3CassiusSkillUp

##I3RachaelConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
Shhh[...] It's alright, Tiamat[...][N]
It's just a boat[...][A][N]
Ah, apologies, milady. My pegasus[...][N]
Tiamat, here. She's a little stressed.[A][N]
Fickle creatures, pegasi are.[A][N]
[...]You were alright with carrying[N]
both me and Cassius into Mevion,[N]
yet you can't handle a boat?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is there[...] anything I can do?[N]
[...]Tiamat, be a good pegasus[...]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry. I'm sure this'll pass.[A][N]
Maybe I'll take her out flying[N]
for a little.[A] Would that cheer[N]
you up, girl?[A][N]
[CloseEyes][...]Fine. I'll feed you.[A][N]
A bit early, but you[N]
serve us well.[A][N]
Anyway, thank you for checking[N]
in, milady. Good day.[A][X]

##I3RachaelHPUp

##I3EmileConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
You seem deep in thought, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Blair. Being here just[N]
had me thinking.[A][N]
Have you ever noticed that the realms[N]
of anima magic has certain limitations?[A][N]
Because one of those limitations[N]
appears to be with water.[A][N]
For one reason or another, the forces[N]
driving anima seem[...][A] incompatible[N]
with water. At least, directly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I never thought to notice that,[N]
but I guess you're right![A][N]
Though, our magic can still[N]
interact with it in a sense[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Fire, magical or not,[N]
will always boil a liquid.[A][N]
Likewise, electricity will[N]
course through it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What about ice magic?[N]
Isn't that basically water?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[...] slightly more complex.[N]
I've been meaning to test it myself,[A][N]
but I believe the current prevailing[N]
theory is that ice is a subset of wind.[A][N]
Specifically, using wind to cool off[N]
and freeze water in the air.[A][N]
That's why most functional [OpenQuote]ice[CloseQuote] spells[N]
involve wind in their scripts.[A][N]
As for why water can't be directly[N]
called upon,[A] it's one of our[N]
greatest mysteries.[A][N]
There's propositions, of course.[A][N]
Some believe water is simply too[N]
complex for such a primal force,[A][N]
while some think it has something to[N]
do with the water within living things.[A][N]
[...]But I'm rambling, now.[N]
Apologies, Blair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've nothing to apologize for.[N]
I enjoy learning from you.[A][X]

##I3JeffConvo

Hello, Jeff. Glad to[N]
see you're still around.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Did you think I'd run off?[N]
[...]Probably deserved that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't mean[N]
for it to come out like that.[A][N]
I'm genuinely just glad to[N]
have you in our army.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]

Aren't there better people to talk to?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Much as you may deny it,[N]
you're one of us, Jeff.[A][N]
There's a good future[N]
for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Again, I thank you for letting[N]
us travel with you.[A][N]
You've truly been a blessing[N]
unto us all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's nothing, Apollo.[N]
We have more than enough room, anyway.[A][N]
Anyway, since I've never been to Opistia,[N]
is there anything I should know?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Funny you should ask. I believe I[N]
was visited by a vision.[A][N]
It told me that we will find ourselves[N]
in the desert soon,[A] and that treasures[N]
beyond our understanding are hiding.[A][N]
[...]The lonely isle of thunder[...][N]
[...]The stairways of delight[...][A][N]
[...]A corner near the delta[...][N]
Those might be important places.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see. If Opistus told you of those,[N]
they must indeed be important.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I shall write them down for you.[N]
Thank you for visiting, Blair.[A][X]

Aye, it be quite grand.[A][N]

they were the worst.[A][N]
How could've I known that, though?[N]
Spent me whole life with 'em.[A][N]
That'd make any piece[N]
o' scum yer chum.[A][N]
But now, I can do what I love[N]
