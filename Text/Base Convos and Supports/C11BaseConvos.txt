[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]*Sigh*[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You know, I'd thought I had[N]
something going.[A][N]
That I was this defender of the[N]
weak I proclaimed myself to be.[A][N]
But at every turn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, life's[N]
trying to prove me wrong![A][N]
Twice now, Yg'stra's had us[N]
backed up into a corner,[A][N]
and twice now, I've failed this[N]
army in its darkest moments![A][N]
You'd think I'd have learned[N]
a thing or two[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] But no![A][N]
People have died because of[N]
my failure to protect them![A][N]
Maybe it's time I pack[N]
up and retire[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Huh? What's this?[A][N][MoveRight]
Whoa! This lance is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] immaculate![N]
The most beautiful I've ever seen.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Oh. And there's the bones of[N]
the man who died wielding it.[A][N]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] For the lance itself to be so[N]
pristine[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That must mean something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel it calling me. Telling me[N]
that my duty is not yet done.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps you're right, lance.[N]
Maybe it isn't too late to save someone.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I'm just gonna[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveRight]
take you real quick[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
There we go. You're truly a[N]
thing of beauty.[A] Thanks for[N]
reminding me of my path.[A][X]

It appears we have no choice[N]
but to fight in the sands.[A][N]
Far from an ideal situation,[N]
especially for our cavalry,[A][N]
but our enemies will obviously[N]
have to contend with it too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd hardly noticed[N]
the sand as an issue.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, right. I've read about this before.[N]
Magic users aren't affected by the sand.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How DOES that work, anyway?[A][N]
I guess since we're in the holy land,[N]
acolytes may have some sort of favor?[A][N]
And I suppose anima mages might have[N]
some say over the earth?[A] But then[N]
what about elder scholars?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] better not to think about it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. On an unrelated note,[N]
I see some strange markings in the sand.[A][N]
Perhaps we should investigate them,[N]
assuming we have the time.[A][N]
It's possible they're hiding[N]
something quite valuable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you suggesting buried treasure?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Cid's crew would've enjoyed that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. No point in dwelling on it.[A][X]

Howsabout you and I flex[N]
our prowess?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you challenging me?[N]
Ha! You're something else.[A][N]
You're on, new guy.[N]
But know I won't lose![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

called me lassie, you dope.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Well, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What be yer name?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Natasia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Bechamel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Bechamel? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
certainly a name.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. Me siblin', bless 'em wherever[N]
they be, be named Hollandaise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Were your parents just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
really into sauces?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
In me home, the Lowlands, quality[N]
food like that be a luxury.[A][N]
Perchance that kind of luxury[N]
be what inspired them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see, I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, tell ya' what.[N]
I'm a decent cook myself.[A][N]
Win a match against me, and I'll[N]
make us some delicious grub.[A][N]
In fact, I might make it anyway.[N]
You've got me hungry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Ye've got me pinned already![N]
Us pirates can't resist a good meal.[A][N]
On yer mark, lassie![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Excuse me, miss. I happened to[N]
notice your garb[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Would you happen to be associated[N]
with the church of Opistus?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's it to you? Associated[N]
is a strong word.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? Look, I'm from Mevion.[N]
Was a teenager around the revolution.[A][N]
Took up healing then. I just happened[N]
to take up clerical duties afterwards.[A][N]
Fit perfectly with my skillset.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you saying you don't believe[N]
in his power?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm saying I don't need anyone[N]
preaching at me.[A][N]
Opistus talks a lovely game, but in[N]
the end, it's us that matter.[A][N]
I'd much rather make my own miracles[N]
happen than wait for some god.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry if that's not what[N]
you had wanted to hear.[A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's alright. Good day, miss.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello, Blair. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How've[N]
you been holding up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] rough.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I understand. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just realized I never[N]
thanked you for Elba Cor.[A][N]
Quite glad you found me before[N]
some bandits could.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's nothing, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As both a teacher and as a friend,[N]
I have something to tell you.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're doing the best you can.[N]
And sometimes, that's enough.[A][N]
I'll stand behind you, no matter[N]
how rough this journey gets.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't you tell I'm[N]
deep in thought, Rachael?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Frankly, I thought you to be asleep.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn. Was I that obvious?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get recent events have been tiring,[N]
but that's-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No excuse to slack off. I know.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm truly the world's biggest fool.[A][N]
What do I want out of life? Being[N]
an errand-boy obviously wasn't it,[A][N]
but is this truly better?[N]
Throwing away my twenties for this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're nineteen.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And you're quite the optimist, thinking[N]
this war'll end that quickly.[A][N]
No. What's going to happen is that[N]
this war will ripple through our lives.[A][N]
Twenty years in the future, we'll[N]
still be suffering the consequences.[A][N]
Assuming we even make it that long.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then why are you still here?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Again, no clue.[A][N]
Maybe some part of me thinks[N]
that I can make a difference.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, if you're tired of downer Cassius,[N]
come back in twenty minutes or so.[A][N]
Sometimes I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think about this[N]
too much. It's not worth it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keep yourself well, Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You too, Rachael.[A][X]
