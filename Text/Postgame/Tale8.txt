##Tale8Opening
[OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric]
Is this the place?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hm. Let's see. Bandits everywhere.[N]
Swamps everywhere.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That describes half this[N]
damned country, Viridian.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fair. [...]Over there, though.[N]
Those ruins seem distinct.[A][N]
Any input, Clarque?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
[...]I believe this is it.[A][N]
If our knowledge is correct,[N]
dozens have been taken here.[A][N]
No clue what these ruffians[N]
have in store,[A] but it's[N]
clearly nothing good.[A][N]
The upshot is that their[N]
guard's light today.[A][N]
That's where we come in.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right. Simple job.[A][N]
Get to those ruins and get[N]
the civilians out.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Nervous? Don't be.[N]
We'll be fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He's right. You're a clever[N]
kid.[A] You might've not done[N]
much to this degree yet,[A][N]
but you're a natural.[A][N][OpenRight]
I appreciate it.[A][N]
Still, you're the real[N]
star of the show.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Let's see how long that'll[N]
keep up, kid.[A][N]
[...]Besides, Dean here might[N]
have me beat.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadDean]
Whatever ya' say.[A][N]
[...]Chin up, kid. We'll[N]
do great.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse]
That's[...] right.[A][N]
I'm certain we'll prevail.[N]
As long as we're together.[A][N][OpenRight]
Heh. Well, then.[A][N]
Let's not keep 'em[N]
waiting any longer.[A][N]
Onwards, everyone![A][X]

##Tale8GenericSaved
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
That one made it out![A][X]

##Tale8AllSaved
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
That's the last of them![A][X]

##Tale8ElizaSaved
[OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
T-Thank you[...][A][N]
Thank you![A][X]

##Tale8DirkSaved
[OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
Eliza! Where are you?[A][N]
[...]I appreciate this.[N]
Truly.[A][X]

##Tale8WarningDialogue
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOlsen]
Ooo. Don't like the sound of that.[A][N]
Think they're gettin' close to[N]
pourin' outta their hideout.[A][N]
And with that, they're bound to[N]
bring anyone still inside.[A][N]
Better hurry, team.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]Who in the world said that?[A][X]

##Tale8ForcedOut
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadBlank]
Grrr[...] Where's me axe?[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]
I thought ye had it,[N]
ye dribblin' fool![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]
So we shoved 'em hostages[N]
out the door for nothin'?[A][N]
You IDIOT![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]
Eh, we'll catch 'em.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza]
Brother.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Run.[A][X]

##Tale8Ending
[OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque][OpenRight]
That's that. Well done, team.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
All five civilians are[N]
safe and sound.[A][N]
Dean's keeping watch[N]
over them as we speak.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Five?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's a small number.[N]
Easy to count.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]That[...] it is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's far too small.[A][N]
Five hostages would never be held[N]
by this small a contingent.[A][N]
Or be worth a call to arms[N]
at all, frankly.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Wait. Off from their hideout.[N]
Smoke's rising.[A][N]
Let me check something.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[...]There he goes. Could've warned me[N]
not to stand in Beryl's wingspan.[A][N]
[...]I fear we're thinking the same[N]
thing here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Was our information wrong?[A][N]
In retrospect, there were supposed[N]
to be more than five.[A][N]
[...]Several hideouts, perhaps?[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric]
As I suspected. It's a smoke signal.[A][N]
Appears that there're some other[N]
hideouts[...] in the area[...][A][N][OpenRight]
[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Ah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If they're signaling to each other,[N]
we've no time to lose.[A][N]
You saw where their correspondants[N]
are. Lead the charge, Freddric.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove](...Is false hope worth it?[N]
...Worse not to try.)[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
##Tale8Ending2
[OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft][LoadChartreuse]
Is[...] Is there anything we[N]
can do for you?[A][N]
I'm certain we can escort[N]
you home if[...][A][N]
If you're afraid.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...][A][N][OpenRight]
We[...] We've hardly got[N]
a home, now.[A][N]
It's just us against[N]
a cold world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft]
Sure you could travel wit'[N]
this bunch for a bit.[A][N]
They'll take the com-[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Krackoom!*[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
W-W-What[...]! What was that?[A][N][OpenRight]
Over there! It's like[...][N]
a pillar of flame![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[...] near where the[N]
rest o' them were headin'.[A][N]
[...]Hold, here.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][X]
##Tale8Ending3
[OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Krackoom!*[A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wha-![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Ahead! Our target[...][N]
It's engulfed in flame![A][N][OpenRight]
W-What?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Burning down secondary hideouts[N]
once the first falls[...][A][N]
This gets them nothing. All[N]
driven by a sense of spite.[A][N]
[...]Unless they're destroying[N]
them to kill any survivors.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Damn it. I[...] should've known[N]
we found too few.[A][N]
That this wasn't them all.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]So that's it, then.[A][N][CloseEyes]
We[...] We come, we fight, and[N]
then[...] We lose, anyway.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We[...] We still were able[N]
to get a few to safety.[A][N][OpenRight]
And we failed[...][N]
Who knoes many others.[A][N]
[...]Clarque. We're[...] We're going.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Going where, exactly?[A][N][OpenRight]
going to figure out how to finish writing this whoops[A][N][X]

That I am. How many[N]
of you are there?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Including us two? I believe[N]
