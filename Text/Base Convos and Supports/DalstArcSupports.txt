[...]I thought I should tell you.[A][N]
I knew your brother.[A] The one[N]
we fought recently, that is.[A][N]
I've matched bows with him before.[N]
[...]Not sure where I'm going with this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] appreciate the thought, Charley.[A][N]
But[...] IF this is how it had[N]
to be with him[...][A] I will[N]
make it through this grief.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He[...] wasn't a bad man.[A][N]
A bit cocky, but aren't we all?[A][N]
And it's not like he didn't have[N]
some skills to back him up.[A][N]
[...]It's a shame what Dalst[N]
made him do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] could've very well been me,[N]
if life went differently.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But I'm the one who gets to[N]
survive.[A] To live as something[N]
more than a dying house.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Unfortunate as the circumstances[N]

Nonsense, Athena. My weight[N]
is all mine to bear.[A][N]
And I've come too far with[N]
you all to doubt my cause.[A][N]
Perhaps I started as a knight[N]
of Dalst.[A] But I truly feel at[N]

It simply wouldn't be just for me[N]

wrong for your faith to waver.[A][N]

Course, of course.[A][N]
I'd be foolish to think you're[N]
changing just from this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Right. A fool beyond words.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Worry not, child. My actions[N]

I have granted all manners of[N]
control necessary to the church.[A][N]
If I were to fall in battle, our[N]
holy land would be alright.[A]{N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't Opistia an ally of Dalst?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very true. Aercolyn and Dalst both[N]
are our allied nations on paper.[A][N]
And perhaps it is irresponsible for[N]
me to turn against one of them.[A][N]
But I believe our path to be just.[N]
To be one that He is proud of.[A][N]
And we fight not out of hatred,[N]
but of wishing to right wrongs.[A][N]
Unfortunate as it may be, if it[N]
brings peace to the continent,[A][N]
I am willing to make Dalst[N]
stand down and repent.[A][N]
If worst comes to worst, I shall ask[N]
nothing but peace for Opistia.[A][N]
But I am willing to risk myself[N]
for the sake of the young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then we cannot lose.[A][N]
Besides, there is[...] much that[N]

there's a difference.[A][N]
Between what a country wants[N]
and what a country needs.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Well, then. Can't go letting[N]
you down.[A] I'll make a just[N]
future for Holanis.[A][N]
Even if it hurts in the now.[A][X]

Heya, Leila.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Do you have more idiotic[N]
schemes like last time?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nah. Not enough space in here[N]
to make my pegasus idea work.[A][N]
Besides, you didn't seem to[N]
like it.[A] Not gonna bring up[N]
somethin' you don't like again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Huh.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey. I can be serious.[N]
[...]Not good at it.[A][N]
But I sure can be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Good for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for ya' to be cold.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Wouldn't hurt to smile.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]That's all you get.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That'll do.[A][X]

Say, Mikey. What's the most[N]
delicious thing you can make?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's a tough one.[N]
Taste's subjective.[A][N]
I know you're quite the[N]
fan of meats[...][A][N]
Especially the smoked variety.[A][N]
So to you, that's probably[N]
the best meal I can produce.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. What's YOUR favorite, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I'd have to go with[N]
this particular stew.[A][N]
My father used to make it[...][N]
It's nothing too special.[A][N]
But at the same time, it's[N]
everything it needs to be.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Could never make it[N]
quite how he could.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sounds tasty. I'm sure you[N]
could do it justice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Perhaps. It's been some time[N]
since I've last made it.[A][N]
But it'd do me good.[A][N]
And I know you. You'll eat[N]
anything I make anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're probably right there.[A][N]
I'd trust you to make a[N]
plate of rocks taste good.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Well, now's as good a[N]
time as any.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You got me swingin' axes.[N]
Only fair I pay you back.[A][N]
[...]This is a healing staff.[N]
It heals people.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see. I know you said[N]
you're not good at this.[A][N]
Teaching things, I mean.[A][N]
And healing seems really[N]
complicated.[A][N]
I can always just ask[N]
Blair to show me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Trust me. This means a lot[N]
to little ol' me.[A][N]
[...]You've served as good stress[N]
relief, and as a good friend.[A][N]
The least I can do is stretch[N]
myself a bit to help you out.[A][N]
Besides, this'll help you keep[N]
anyone else you care about safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well[...] I can't go denying[N]
you now, can I?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]As I was saying, this is a[N]
staff.[A] It's sorta like an axe.[N]
Long wooden shaft. Object on top.[A][N]
They're fickle little bastards, though.[N]
Gotta grip them like so.[A][N]
Else, their magic just won't work.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see, I see.[A][N]
I've seen you use that[N]
a lot. Let me try.[A][N][MoveRight]
[...]So, do I just grab it like[N]
this and wave it around?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's a bit more complex.[N]
[...]But that'll do for now.[A][N]
You're a quick learner.[N]
You'll figure it out.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me,[A][N]
I think that guy over there's[N]
just asking to be bonked.[A][X]
