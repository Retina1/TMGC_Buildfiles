[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter how many times I[N]
come up here, it's amazing.[A][N]
The whole world's down there.[A][N]
But now's hardly the time for that.[A][N]
I came up here for a clear space[N]
to think.[A] Something must be[N]
done about Sinclair.[A][N]
I know not what posessed that fool,[N]
but his shortsightedness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's going to bring an end to[N]
us all.[A] He's too dangerous to[N]
be left in his current position.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I figured I'd find you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Tarqiun. You're a lucky man.[N]
You don't have to handle this.[A][N]
Though, humor me. What would you[N]
do with Aercolyn's lord?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He threatens the law of this land.[N]
I'd strip him of everything.[A][N]
And then, send him on his way.[N]
It's harsh, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Extreme measures for the good of all.[N]
I understand your viewpoint.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe that's what we do, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What of his daughter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]She's got a life ahead to[N]
prove her worth to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've got an idea. Once I'm[N]
back in Arbordia,[A] I'll draft[N]
up a sentencing.[A][N]
This world's a changing and chaotic[N]
place. We must stand firm.[A][N]
Stand for what'll keep us thriving[N]
tomorrow.[A][X]
