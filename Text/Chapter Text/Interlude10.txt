##Interlude10Notice
Note: Visual bugs may appear if you[N]
deploy units in too many unique classes.[A][N]
This might actually be behavior you've[N]
seen earlier in the game -[A][N]
apologies for that, but there's sadly[N]
not any real way around it.[A][N]
That said, the Foundation can promote[N]
any unit,[A] so if you're running into[N]
visual bugs,[A] you can promote units to[N]
reduce the amount of unique class sprites,[A][N]
and thus hopefully reduce the chance of[N]
running into visual bugs.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]Beautiful scene, isn't it?[A][N]
Reminds me of[...] thirteen?[N]
[...]Thirteen years ago.[A][N]
After leaving you. I had stopped[N]
at a lake much like this.[A][N]
Thought about what my actions[N]
would lead to.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It's[...] quite on the nose,[N]
really.[A] Perhaps I'm trying[N]
too hard myself.[A][N]
To make this all mean something[N]
bigger, I mean.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But enough about me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What do I do now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Relax yourself, Lirel.[A][N]
Close your eyes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][CloseEyes]Alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What is it you see?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What? I[...] see nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Then let that nothingness be[N]
what grants you understanding.[A][N]
The tapestry that forms this world[...][A][N]
The endless weaves that come together[N]
to create this land and all within.[A][N]
You[...] The powers you bear[...][N]
They are a snag in this tapestry.[A][N]
A snarl that stands in defiance of[N]
this world.[A] The threads of the[N]
world that you bear[...][A][N]
You can grasp at them. Take hold[N]
of them. Unravel them.[A][N]
Reshape them.[A][N]
[...]Within Jraeyan, we kept a magical[N]
blade of quality unmatched.[A][N]
An implement with which to hone[N]
the abilities of our[...] subjects.[A][N]
You yourself have used this blade.[N]
[...]Perhaps you may not recall it.[A][N]
Even so, within yourself, there[N]
may be whispers of it.[A][N]
[...]Bring it within your grasp.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A sword that I don't recall[...][N]
On the other side of the continent.[A][N]
[...]How am I[...]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unravel the threads. Rewrite[N]
what is and is not.[A][N]
The animus that binds life is[N]
something we're all linked to.[A][N]
With you, we've simply strengthened[N]
that link.[A] Whatever you will[N]
shall be made true.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Don't fear this, child.[A][N]
Perhaps you never wanted any[N]
of this.[A] [...]And for that,[N]
I suppose I should apologize.[A][N]
But we are not thirteen years[N]
in the past.[A] We are in this[N]
moment.[A] You can run away[N]
from this all,[A] or embrace[N]
the hand you've been dealt.[A][N]
Prove to me that you can make[N]
something spectacular of it.[A][N]
[...]Prove to yourself.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][MoveMidLeft]Make this all mean anything.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've[...] lived a life not[N]
knowing what my purpose is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is[...] this why[...]?[N]
Are you all[...] why?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then[...] I'll use this[...][N]

[...][A][OpenEyes][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hm. Well done, Lirel. You[N]
have been an excellent subject.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Where[...] are you going?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadSimone]
[...]You're the pinnacle of[N]
Project Valkyrie, here.[A][N]
You already know what you can do.[N]
[...]Continue to impress me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][CloseEyes]So this has been me all along.[A][N]
[...]But what does this truly have to[N]
change?[A][OpenEyes] [...]I[...] am Arin Lirel.[A][N]
I was before this, and I will continue[N]
to be.[A] All this is[...] is another[N]
path for me to take.[A][N]
[...]Another way to protect what I hold dear.[N]
[...]I truly do feel powerful.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps she was right. I can make[N]
something of this.[A][N]
Not for her sake[...] But for mine.[N]
My companions'.[A][N]
I'll fight with everything I[N]
have within, for their sakes.[A][N]
[...]Animus[...] She mentioned[N]
something of that.[A][N]
And the valkyrie[...][A][N]
[...]I shall see what equipment[N]
I can find in Aercolyn.[A][N]
There is[...] much for me to[N]
rise to.[A] But I will never[N]

Then we make our stand.[A][N]
We'll have watch posted constantly,[N]
so we'll be ready when they're here.[A][N]
And after that[...]?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Once we weather the assault,[N]

I shall have Elba Cor's finest[N]

[...]Thank you, Father.[A][N]
And[...] I'm sorry for all of this.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I keep dragging people into conflicts[N]
way beyond what even I can handle-[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's alright. [...]You're hardly dragging[N]
anyone along.[A] They wish to fight[N]
for you. A just young man like you.[A][N]
They fight knowing the risk they carry.[N]
That they might not return home.[A][N]
And still, they fight.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Why[...] am I the one that[N]
they fight for?[A][N]
Surely, there's someone better[N]

More just[...][A] Someone who[N]
deserves it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]

[...]You came so far without me.[N]

You[...] still don't understand[N]
how much you've done for us?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]

I truly believe each and every person[N]
who fights for us is as important as me.[A][N]
Maybe[...] Maybe you do feel weak alone.[N]
Like your life doesn't matter.[A][N]
That's[...] how I've felt, sometimes.[N]
That I have to prove myself.[A][N]
[...]To nobody.[A][N]
That there's something that I could[N]
never live up to.[A][N]
And maybe that would be right if[N]
I were alone.[A] But I'm not.[A][N]
And[...] neither are you.[A][N]
Maybe you don't understand why[N]
you're here with us.[A][N]
Maybe nobody does.[A][N]

of view, it's not that simple.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I could see how we're driven[N]
by a desire for revenge.[A][N]

Do you think I've changed[N]

How so? I'd say we've[N]

Well, obviously we've grown[N]

keeps up, will I still be me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Weren't you just at some[N]

Why not go back?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

It's been thrilling, runnin'[N]

Clearly I chose the wrong career[N]
path long ago.[A][N]
Guess there'll probably still[N]
be things to do after this war.[A][N]
If the revolution's taught me[N]
anything,[A] it's that nobody's[N]
truly happy with change.[A][N]
Whatever we do, whoever we[N]
depose[...][A] Someone's gonna[N]
get up in arms about it.[A][N]
And maybe I could be the one[N]
to give 'em a good whack.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd prefer a future of peace[...][A][N]
But I also know that that's[N]
not always an option.[A][N]

it's been an easy road.[A][N]

But we can't rest with them merely[N]
being back.[A] We must ensure our[N]

but still[...][A] I feel complicit.[A][N]
To my knowledge, those in power at[N]

Many in Holanis make deals, in fact.[A][N]
Researchers travel around, offering[N]
gold and supplies for various items.[A][N]
Do you know those crystals you found[N]

There's a cave a few miles from Gohranos[N]

Well, that's part of the mystery.[A][N]
Scholars can't agree what this bow[N]
actually functioned as.[A][N]
Some say it could shoot in close[N]
quarters, thanks to its small size.[A][N]
Others say that it was intended to[N]
shoot several times as fast,[A][N]

travel time for the arms.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Interesting[...] Is that there just[N]
a replica?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Technically, it's functional.[A][N]
But it's extremely impractical to use.[N]

It was but a trophy of Dalst.[N]
That, and a treasury of loot.[A][N]
[...]But things had to change.[N]
Do you know of Lazarus?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] do. Well, did.[A][N]
We're the ones who brought[N]
an end to him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks for that![A][N]
But anyway, after his death,[N]
we found some correspondence.[A][N]
It appears he had been writing[N]
letters to someone in Dalst.[A][N]
It seems that he was[...] some[N]
manner of plant.[A] He was to[N]
infiltrate Yg'stra via our tournament,[A][N]
then I guess somehow stir up chaos[N]
and disarray?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] had no idea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Funny thing is, his loyalties[N]
still seemed quite tenuous.[A][N]
Judging by his final letter,[A][N]
he was planning on aiming his[N]
sights squarely at Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Was[...] Dalst trying to force this[N]
war from the beginning?[A][N]
What[...] could they get out of[N]
provoking Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your guess is as good as mine.[A][N]
In any case, that's a reason to[N]
bring this conflict to an end.[A][N]
No more intrigue. No more deception.[N]
No more wars.[A][N]
Just our nations, coexisting.[A][N]
Growing. Flourishing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I quite like the sound of that.[A][X]

You're Tobias, right? I think[N]
I've heard tales of you.[A][N]
Even when we were invading[N]
Yg'stra,[A] you were something[N]

that whole war, by the way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've nothin' to apologize for, lass.[N]
Not like you were the aggressor.[A][N]

but I also won't turn down praise.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Regale me with a[N]

Hm[...] How about the one time I wrestled[N]
down a bear entirely bare-handed?[A][N]
[...]Well, that'd be a lie. It wasn't just[N]
a one time event.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How[...] How much do you[N]
wrestle bears?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
More than any feller my age should.[N]
But I'm still up and kickin'.[A][N]
There's this one persistent grizzly[N]
who lives near my cottage.[A][N]
Almost feels like I gotta shoo[N]
'im off weekly.[A] Named the guy[N]
Hank. Somethin' of a rival, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] quite spectacular.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

then rips it away from us.[A][N]
That is why they are unforgivable.[A][N][OpenEyes]

There's no way I won't fight with[N]

doing fine.[A] I'd rather[N]
not risk your life for cash.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wait, really? Thought I'd[N]
be more expendable.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What would ever make you[N]
think that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]A miserable upbringing where I was[N]
forced to fight for every bare scrap.[A][N]
A life in the arena, where every coin[N]
was won purely with my blood.[A][N]
The recent events with the Viridian[N]
Mercenaries, of which-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand. But[...] Don't worry.[N]
I won't throw your life away.[A][N]
I know there's not any real way[N]

This is truly a dire situation[N]
we find ourselves in,[A][N]
but even so[...] I'm almost[N]
excited about it.[A][N]
There's something beyond compare[N]
about history happening,[A][N]
right before our eyes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd rather history back away[N]
from me for a brief moment,[A][N]
but I'm glad someone's enjoying[N]
the happenings.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] Enjoying feels wrong.[A][N]
I'd more say I'm simply[N]
enriched by it.[A][N]
It is an experience unlike any[N]
other I've known.[A][N]
And I specifically wish to keep[N]
it alive for others to witness.[A][N]
Truly, that is the beauty of my[N]
artform.[A] Capturing that rare[N]

And it will feel so very ecstatic.[A][X]

Tell me, Estelle. Last we talked,[N]

Have you ever considered it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't say I have. But[...][A][N]
If you think it'd suit me,[N]
I'd love to give it a go.[A][N]
Sounds like a fun time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm truly honored to hear.[A][N]
Perhaps we shall ascend to the[N]
upper echelons together![A][N]
[...]But let us not get ahead[N]
of ourselves.[A] When we've some[N]

The ones that have wrought[N]

What's shameful about that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Does it not distress you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
There's a difference between[N]

Can't tell you 'ow this battle will[N]

It's certainly[...] interesting.[A][N]
The idea of revolution. I hope not[N]
to let my people grow discontent.[A][N]
[...]I'm sure leaving for months isn't[N]
exactly the strongest of looks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps not. But our king was barely[N]
sure of the contempt towards him.[A][N]
It nearly took a pike through his[N]
head to realize something was wrong.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It took all of his most faithful that.[A][N]
But just the same, your people may be[N]
willing to overlook what you think grievous.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Hardly.[A] 'Twas a journey in[N]

An assassination, in particular.[A][N]
I was to assassinate, and the[N]

Sadly, our target was[...] wiser[N]

Quite the swordsman too.[A][N]
He fell in the end, but he took[N]
my arm with him.[A] I[...] had[N]
considered giving in there.[A][N]
Hanging up my blade.[A][N]
But I yearned for adventures.[N]
For new stories to tell.[A][N]
And with practice, I got back[N]
to my former skill.[A][N]
Perhaps even more.[A][N]
Plus, people underestimate me.[A][N]
Always a bit of a joy to show[N]

What does Q stand for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I stand for truth, justice,[N]

Your name, Q[...] What does the[N]

Well, it's also my name.[N]
A lovely name, no?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Yes. Yes, it is.[A][N]
Let me guess[...] You have[N]
no relation to Jraeyan.[A][N]
You're just a quirky Holanian[N]
wanderer.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You got that right![A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]There's mysterious, and[N]

Say, little guy. I had an idea.[A][N]
Once we kick out Lord Arbordia,[N]
I might make YOU its lord.[A][N]
Wouldn't mean a thing, really.[N]
Dalst's going to change forever,[A][N]

You've been a big help, Tonnamin.[N]

How do you mean, lass?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Most of our army has ambitions[N]

Or, at the very least, they're[N]
fighting for a friend here.[A][N]
Not you, though. You're just[N]
along for the ride.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Huh. Guess so. Doesn't[N]
bother me one bit.[A][N]
As I've said, I like takin'[N]
things at my own pace.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That doesn't really have much[N]
to do with joining us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Hello, Miss Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hello, Ian. Do you think[N]
you could stay behind here?[A][N]
Relax back in the castle until[N]
we're done with this war?[A][N]
It'd truly be a big help.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Fear not. I'm sure entwined in[N]

Still, you have the power to use[N]
the turpid gift to serve light.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

What's the matter, Horatio?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The witch in our ranks[...][N]
Simone Georgios.[A][N]
She has shackled my power by forcing[N]
me to cast aside my dear [Tact].[A][N]
Now, it sits alone in a Holanian[N]

A king whose last wish is to be[N]
reunited with the bearer of his will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

The vessel shall persist.[A][N]
Now, fell one.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight] Let that which[N]
is in you bear your salvation.[A][N]
Empty your mind, and picture fire.[A][N]
Picture how it flickers and billows,[A][N]
how the smoke it belches forth curls[N]
and curls again into the night sky.[A][N]
Watch the smoke as it rises higher,[N]
higher,[A] until it's indistinguishable from[N]
the clouds that obscure the stars.[A][N]
[...]Burst through those clouds.[A][N]
Witness the infinite that lies beyond.[A][N]
Take that infinite into your soul.[A][N]
Transcend unto this infinity.[N]
Reach out for what you desire.[A][N]
[...]It shall all be yours.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][ToggleInvert]
H-Horatio[...] What[...] is that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Don't you see, lass?[A][N][Event][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
That's the sacred sword of [Tact].[N]
Brought back unto me.[A][N]
[...]What's that, [Tact]? You wish[N]
to fight together once again?[A][N]
Of course! I shall assent to your[N]
every desire![A] We are bound as[N]
one, man and blade![A][N]
Heed my call, and I shall heed yours![A][N]
No need to worry for me, milady![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've no idea what just happened,[N]
but I'm glad your sword's back.[A][N]
Try not to lose it again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We are inseparable now.[N]
None shall sunder us![A][N][X]
