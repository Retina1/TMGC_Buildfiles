Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Consigned Rapier,[CloseQuote] Arbordia's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. Never mind. I re-evaluated the[N]
look in your eyes.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, how about our chicken?[A][N]
It's made with twice the chicken[N]
as our competitors![A][N]
That's two chicken per chicken![A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]See? I have good ideas.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, Ethyl.[A][N]
On that note, the merc's[N]
here. What happenstance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Viridian, right? I don't believe[N]
we've met,[A] but I'm sure you've[N]
done jobs for my territory.[A][N]
Ciraweiss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] familiar.[A][N]
I was just exploring the[N]
city for a moment, Elcorian.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Of course. Take your time.[A][N]
Lodging arrangements have been[N]
handled.[A] And I'm sure your[N]
party could use some rest.[A][N]
Again, you've exceeded my[N]
expectations.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Exceeded, you say?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhsps I'll have a job[N]
for you as well.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anyway, what were we talking[N]
about, Elcorian?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Something about stars falling.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right. I guess it doesn't[N]
hurt if the merc hears.[A][N]
I've been researching a spell that[N]
harnesses power beyond compare.[A][N]
There's an[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unstable version[N]
that's too much even for me,[A][N]
but I think I've finally worked[N]
out a more controlled casting.[A][N]
Perhaps once I refine it, we'll[N]
have the power to not need mercs.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then again, it needs a mage[N]
of sublime ability to control it.[A][N]
There's more mercenaries than master[N]
anima users in the world.[A][N]
So you'll always have a place.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad.[A][X]

Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that you, Viridian?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'd say it must be.[N]
Good to see ya, kid.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It's good to see you two, too.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where're the others?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Off at some play, I believe.[N]
We'll make sure you see them.[A][N]
How's the mercenary company been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Great, actually. Some big shot noble[N]
invited us to the capital.[A][N]
Impressed him real good on a job.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ha! Nicely done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
FINISH THIS CONVO LATER PLEASE aLRIGHT THANKS[X]

##I7Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
I see you've got business to[N]
handle.[A] Everyone else is already[N]
heading towards the inn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll catch up. Feel free[N]
to go join them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nonsense. I'll stay by[N]
your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Understandable. I just wanted to[N]
find them before it got dark.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. Your family's currently[N]
living here, correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. I'm sure the open road'll call[N]
them again eventually,[A] but until[N]
that day, this is their home.[A][N]
Gonna throw some gold their way,[N]
since we've finally some to spare.[A][N]
While I'm out here, maybe I'll also[N]
restock the group's supplies.[A][N]
There's some interesting stores here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. This may also be a rare[N]
chance to take it easy for a while.[A][N]
Well, then. Let's find them.[A][X]

Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] 100000[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If we[N]
set aside 3000 per person[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Besides me, of course.[N]
That's several weeks of pay.[A][N]
And then 4000 for the folks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That'll leave us with[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
60000 or so. That'll be good.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fred'll be waiting for me[N]
once I've seen them.[A][N]
Let's not keep him waiting[N]
too horribly long.[A][X]
