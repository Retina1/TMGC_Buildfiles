[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even after these weeks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I can't quite grasp it.[A][N]
The dragons we've seen are all[N]
artificial beings[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Creating something like that is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It should be impossible.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And yet, it happened. Has[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Elcorian ever spoken of this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not that I know of. I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
he often travels to Holanis.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You'd think he'd tell me.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm in the dark. I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] dread[N]
this feeling.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's frustrating, for sure.[N]
Feeling powerless like that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that's why I've come this[N]
far. To assert myself.[A][N]
To show that I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not powerless.[A][N]
And, hey. You're part of why.[A][N]
Wouldn't know much of magic[N]
without your guidance.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're too kind.[N]
But you're right.[A][N]
A true scholar doesn't give up[N]
just because they don't know.[A][N]
That's the point of our pursuits.[N]
To unravel the unknown.[A][N]
It's a long and discouraging road,[N]
but the knowledge we gain[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That's a reward like no other.[A][N]
Sometimes I just need a reminder[N]
of that. So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thanks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Emile. You've gotten[N]
me this far.[A] The least I can[N]
do for you is a little pick-me-up.[A][X]

##C21_Arin_Desmond_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
You've seemed somewhat off[N]
lately, Arin.[A][N]
I don't mean to pry, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Are you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can't hide from you, I suppose.[N]
I'm just thinking about Zeimstadt.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, of course. To think we're up[N]
against a power that can create life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not that. There was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a being.[N]
That fought like me.[A][N]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] looked like me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've wanted[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to write it off[N]
as mere coincidence. Truly.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It doesn't matter. You're one[N]
of us, no matter what.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. Maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
it's truly nothing.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can tell you're not satisfied[N]
with that answer.[A][N]
That's alright.[A][N]
I understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wanting[N]
something definite.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But we'll help you find[N]
the answers you seek.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate it, Desmond.[A][X]

##C21_Peggy_Apollo_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
I've been meaning to ask[N]
ya' something, bud.[A][N]
You don't seem to be too keen[N]
on this whole violence thing.[A][N]
Which, hey. I understand.[A][N]
I don't get it, but I[N]
understand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, why do you fight?[A][N]
You seem like you'd be better[N]
off holed up in some church.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps I would. But there's[N]
so many people in this world.[A][N]
So many people without that[N]
luxury.[A] With people like[N]
that in the world[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It'd be unfair to run away[N]
and hide.[A] It's hard, but I[N]
know my cause is just.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You almost sound like one[N]
of those knightly types.[A][N]
Some kinda crusader.[A][N]
But, I can respect that.[A][N]
My reasons are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] selfish,[N]
by comparison.[A][N]
But, hey. Good's good, no[N]
matter what my intents are.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very true, Peggy.[A][X]

##C21_Zeke_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heya, prince. I heard[N]
about what you saw.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is it wrong of me to pity[N]
those mercenaries?[A][N]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] chose this. Everyone who[N]
fights knows what they risk.[A][N]
But even so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
all died for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you afraid you'll[N]
die for nothing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The thought's crossed my mind.[A][N]
But it's more terrifying to[N]
live for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the purpose of my life?[A][N]
I'm a prince who knows nothing[N]
of his kingdom.[A][N]
Nothing of his people.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I have to do all this.[N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to prove myself.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is this really the best way to[N]
show you'd make a good king?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. But it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the[N]
only way I know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If that's the way it is.[A][N]
I'll follow your judgement.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Take it easy, prince.[A][X]

##C21_Apollo_Vladmir_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Greetings, young one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How've you been, Archbishop?[N]
You're a great help to us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm quite well. Feels good to[N]
stretch my legs some.[A][N]
The world's a wonderful place, and[N]
it's truly great to see it.[A][N]
Maybe I'll take Wendell out here,[N]
someday.[A] He'd like exploring[N]
these mountains, I'm sure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How has he been, by the way?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I recieved word that he's been[N]
feeling better.[A] Perhaps I'll[N]
see if anyone can fly him down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heh. The image of a graceful[N]
archbishop alot a dragon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's almost unimaginable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps. But our bond is a testament[N]
to mankind's understanding.[A][N]
He guides us to seek an understanding[N]
of all things and all beings.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]When you put it like that,[N]
that's quite remarkable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In any case, to ensure our reunion,[N]
we must guide our allies to success.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. We'll keep everyone safe.[A][X]

##C21_Hyperius_Leila_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you wish to talk?[N]
Or to waste my time?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I never liked you.[N]
But I respected you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Respected.[A] Past tense.[A][N]
You're a man stuck in the past.[N]
The whole kingdom's like you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's a worthy past.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What about it is worth fighting for?[A][N]
Nothing but the result of one man[N]
hundreds of years ago,[A][N]
picking up a crown and deciding[N]
he was destined to rule?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just gracefully take my[N]
compliment and go away.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C21_Secret_Seller
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJake3]
Guess who it is?[N]
That's right! Jake![A][N]
It's secret shop time![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why is there a shop here?[A][N]
Isn't it an abandoned fort-slash-top[N]
secret research site?[A] Who would[N]
even buy goods from it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Now's not the time to question[N]
the ludonarrative.[A][N]
Now's the time to give you[N]
a patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's tucked right near[N]
one of the back three cells[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's in a very cozy corner,[N]
guarded by a master of blades![A][N]
Well, blade, singular.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for the hint.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing, lassie![A][N]
I'd better be off, then.[N]
Gotta go meet with my twin.[A][N]
She's off in a far-off land.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I fought in[N]
a war there once.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey, this armor's not just[N]
for show, lassie.[A][N]
I make a pretty great cavalier.[A][N]
But that's enough of that.[A][N]
Good luck, and I'll see ya[N]
real soon with another hint![A][X]
