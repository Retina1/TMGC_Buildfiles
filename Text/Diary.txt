## PrologueDiary
Well, it's been quite some time[N]
since I wrote in this thing![N]
Since I've little better to[N]
do on the road to Arbordia,[N]
why not chronicle my thoughts?[N]
[N]
It's been a few months since[N]
my graduation from the[N]
Northern Arbordian academy,[N]
and I thought it'd be quite[N]
some time before my return[N]
to the capital. Imagine my[N]
surprise at an urgent[N]
notice from Sir Elcorian![N]
Perhaps the relegitimization[N]
of Aercolyn is nigh?[N]
[N]
Accompanying me on this road is[N]
Arin, my close friend.[N]
We both went to the academy[N]
together, and have known each[N]
other longer than I remember.[N]
...Not sure why she felt the need[N]
to come, but how can I say no?[N]
[N]
We should arrive within a few[N]
day's travel, now. Maybe I'll[N]
finally be able to prove myself,[N]
and escape the shadow of my[N]
father's deeds...[X]

## Chapt1Diary
After fighting off some rebels,[N]
we met with Sir Elcorian.[N]
The road of relegitimization[N]
will be long and challenging,[N]
but I'm sure all will end well.[N]
[N]
As my first task (I suppose[N]
to prove loyalty?), we've[N]
been sent near the Mevion[N]
border, as there have been[N]
reports of conflict.[N]
From what I understand,[N]
Mevion takes quite an[N]
aggressive approach to[N]
their [OpenQuote]neutrality,[CloseQuote] so[N]
we need to be ready[N]
for anything.[N]
[N]
According to my map, this[N]
all appears to be happening[N]
quite close to a village[N]
a dear friend lives in.[N]
Hopefully she's faring well-[N]
it'd be lovely to see[N]
her again.[X]

## Chapt2Diary
Not much time to write.[N]
Yg'stra's invading, despite[N]
recent negotiations.[N]
[N]
We're the only ones who can[N]
make any kind of meaningful[N]
impact now, which is[N]
honestly a little terrifying.[N]
[N]
No matter what, we won't[N]
give up. I can't lose[N]
everything again.[X]

## Chapt3Diary
Things didn't exactly...[N]
go great. Aercolyn's army[N]
has seemingly disappeared[N]
without a trace.[N]
[N]
I'm now leading a small[N]
force into Yg'stra to[N]
try and seek answers.[N]
...I don't know why this[N]
has to happen to me,[N]
now of all times.[N]
[N]
...It'll all work out fine.[N]
It has to.[X]

## Chapt4Diary
There's not much time.[N]
We have to keep running.[N]
I don't even know where[N]
we're going anymore.[N]
[N]
If this is the end, I'm[N]
sorry for dragging you[N]
all into this.[X]

## Chapt5Diary
Thanks to Peggy, we're[N]
nearing Mevion's swamps[N]
now. I doubt we'll find[N]
ourselves welcome, but[N]
we've hardly any other[N]
options.[N]
[N]
Still, I somehow feel[N]
hopeful after everything.[X]

## Chapt6Diary
The king of Elba Cor wishes[N]
to meet with me. It feels[N]
quite reassuring, knowing[N]
I've an ally somewhere.[N]
[N]
Speaking of allies, I[N]
wonder how Dalst fares...[N]
Even all their magic may[N]
fold to Yg'stra's sheer might.[N]
[N]
...For now, I ought to focus[N]
on myself, and on my mission.[N]
The road to Elba Cor will[N]
surely not be an easy one.[X]

## Chapt7Diary
We're finally nearing Elba Cor.[N]
I've learned more about the[N]
king, and about the tragedies[N]
the kingdom has endured.[N]
[N]
Moreso than ever, I know[N]
I have to see this through.[N]
I have to know what the[N]
king sees in me.[N]
[N]
On a brighter note,[N]
I believe Emile said he'd[N]
spend some time in Elba Cor[N]
for field research. That'd[N]
be something, running into him![X]

## Chapt8Diary
We're off to Loile to help[N]
Captain Cid settle some[N]
business, or something.[N]
I'm not quite sure on the[N]
details, but it's what we[N]
have to do for his aid.[N][N]
Supposedly, the volcano's[N]
due to start spewing ash soon.[N]
I guess I should be glad we're[N]
getting this done now.[N][N]
I'm still just thinking about[N]
how the king's made friends[N]
with a pirate king. That's[N]
something you'd only hear about[N]
in myths, yet here we are!s[X]

## Chapt9Diary
We just left Monuebris, and[N]
I'm... not sure how I feel about{N]
sea travel. I think I like it?[N]
It beats walking, I guess.[N][N]
Opistia... Hopefully, they'll[N]
be the key to resolving this war.[N]
If not, maybe we could sail all[N]
the way around the continent[N]
back to Dalst? ...That sounds[N]
absurd, I know.[N][N]
Whoops! Almost dropped this thing[N]
overboard. That'd be a tragedy.[N]
Guess that's my signal to stop.[X]

## Chapt10Diary
We've been joined by some[N]
Opistians. Surprisingly, the[N]
boat doesn't feel too much[N]
more crowded than before.[N][N]
Let us hope the rest of our[N]
trip is uneventful. I could[N]
do for a few days without[N]
a pirate raid. At least[N]
it's not the Yg'stran army.[X]

## Chapt11Diary
(The page has been[N]
left entirely blank.)[X]

## Chapt12Diary
...It's been a bit since I[N]
wrote in this. We... made[N]
it to Opistia. Got tangled[N]
up in a skirmish ashore.[N]
And now we've procured aid[N]
from the Opistinians.[N][N]
The Archbishop's suggest we[N]
partake in some kind of trial,[N]
and I see no reason to deny him.[N]
Apparently, it's traditional.[N][N]
...Nothing much left to say.[X]

## Chapt13Diary
Thanks to Opistia, we've the[N]
resources to invade Yg'stra.[N]
Hopefully, a decisive attack[N]
will end the war swiftly.[N]
Meanwhile, Opistia shall deploy[N]
to Elba Cor and ensure their[N]
continued survival.[N][N]
It feels... strange, being the[N]
one to lead the charge like this.[N]
Surely someone like the archbishop[N]
would be far more qualified...[N]
In any case, I cannot falter[N]
now.[X]

## Chapt14Diary
We've made it to the palace.[N]
Only one thing remains.[N]
This war will finally come[N]
to an end.[N][N]
Somehow, I feel it's not[N]
truly the end yet.[N]
After all, what of the[N]
missing soldiers?[N]
There's no sign so far[N]
of them anywhere...[N][N]
For now, we have to focus.[N]
For everyone who has fallen,[N]
we must win.[X]
