Fine enough. A bit dark for my liking.[N]
I like being seen, you know.[A][N]
Darkness makes that a problem.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're an archer, though. Wouldn't[N]

Has discretion ever been my style?[N]

Probably. But you won the war,[N]

[...]Alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I wasn't quite invested in many[N]
of the finer details,[A] but the[N]
basic structure's easy to grasp.[A][N]
At the head was Commander Valden.[A][N]
You'd think the emperor, the strongest[N]
warrior in the nation,[A] would be the[N]
one to lead the military,[A][N]
but governal duties muddle that.[A][N]
Underneath him would've been[...][N]
I think Lazarus?[A][N]
The upper echelons always confused me.[A][N]
What matters for the individual is[N]
that soldiers are sorted by specialty,[A][N]
often through which weapons they use[N]
or whether or not they're cavalry,[A][N]
and each of those regiments is lead[N]
by a paragon of that specialty.[A][N]
My[...] My sister's actually the[N]
head of a unit.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

far smaller,[A] and thus far simpler.[N]
If you're curious, I'll enlighten you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

The name? Of the wyvern?[N]
[...]That's[...] personal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Well, perhaps after the battle,[N]
we can test their weight limit.[A][N]
I look forward to it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]How was I supposed to know[N]
I needed to name you, friend?[A][X]

Mister Kenneth! I know your game![N]
You can't hide forever![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you still on that dark magic thing?[N]
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not just a thing, mister![A][N]
I've lost friends[...] and even[N]
my family to dark magic![A][N]
[...]Well, calamities brought upon[N]
by dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sorry to hear that. But I'd like[N]
you to understand something.[A][N]
I'm on your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hmph! You'll just have to[N]
prove that to me![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Back to the battle. I'll[N]
show you my brand of power.[A][X]

[...]Why are you still here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't know. Why are[N]
YOU still here, woman?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I'm a knight of Elba Cor.[N]
It's my duty to serve.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're wasting your life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Why do I even try with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, indeed? At least I know[N]
how messed up I am.[A][N]
You clearly think there's something[N]
worth saving in me.[A][N]
[...]There isn't.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[...]Go away, please.[A][X]

How have you been holding up,[N]
Bechamel?[A] Any luck with[N]
your learning?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, a bit. It be goin' slowly,[N]
but I think I got tha' basics.[A][N]
I'd show ya', but we be a bit[N]
busy fer that now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I'd be happy to see[N]
your progress after the battle.[A][N]
While you can obviously speak[N]
the modern tongue,[A][N]
learning to read written words is[N]
an entirely different experience.[A][N]
But you're a clever man. More so[N]
than you yourself believe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ye flatter me, mate.[N]
Well, take care then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You too, friend.[A][X]

Sir Desmond, a moment.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No need for formality, Mikey.[N]
I'm hardly in charge of you.[A][N]
Desmond's fine.[A][N]
What do you require of me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Can[...] Can you give me a few[N]
pointers on my technique?[A][N]
I need to[...] be better.[N]
So I can make it home.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Survival is an understandable[N]
goal for us all.[A] And proper technique,[N]
while it cannot ensure it,[A] will make[N]
it orders of magnitude more likely.[A][N]
That being said, I've noticed little[N]
that demands improvement.[A][N]
Your technique, as long as you keep[N]
up with drills, shall serve you well.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm glad to hear.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must say, if survival is your goal,[N]
wouldn't it make sense to return home?[A][N]
Nothing binds you to us. Nobody would[N]
blame you for wanting a peaceful life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know[...] But I feel I owe Dalst[...][N]
It's just the way I was raised, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough. In any case, you serve[N]
us well. We'll keep you safe.[A][X]
