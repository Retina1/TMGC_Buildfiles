##C28_Zeke_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
You holdin' up, Zeke?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] ought to ask that[N]
of you, Cassius.[A][N]
This[...] shouldn't be[N]
anyone's fight.[A][N]
Lease of all yours.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd have to disagree.[A][N]
If there's anyone's fight it[N]
shouldn't be, it's yours.[A][N]
You've gone through enough[N]
on this journey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that not my duty?[A][N]
Is it not the place of a prince[N]
to suffer for his people?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And who exactly is this for?[A][N]
Does Elba Cor get anything from[N]
this tragedy?[A][N]
[...]I know you've always felt the[N]
need to prove yourself somehow,[A][N]
but undertaking hardships for your[N]
nation is different from[...] this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And do I deserve this any less?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I said, you don't deserve[N]
this. Nobody does.[A][N]
We don't want you to torment[N]
yourself over this forever.[A][N]
Most of all, I don't want[N]
that for you.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps it's beyond my station[N]
to say this, but to hell with it.[A][N]
Zeke, I want to give my life[N]
to you.[A] Not just as a knight,[N]
but as a person.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Cassius[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Forgive me for that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, it's alright. I just[...][A][N]
I didn't expect that.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]So long, I've felt that all[N]
I am is my bloodline.[A][N]
You[...] reminded me I'm not.[N]
I truly apreciate it.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
And I'll gladly reciprocate[N]
your feelings, Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Really? [...]Wow. This[...][N]
This is a good day.[A][N]
I swear to protect you, Zeke.[N]
[...]Guess that's not changing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And I will fight for you as[N]
I always have.[A][N]
[...]Guess that's also the same.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Much as things change, they don't.[N]
And that's fine by me.[A][N]
They're better now all the same.[A][X]

##C28_Butch_Peter_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeter][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
You know, Peter.[A][N]
I never knew how much[N]
I missed havin' you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. This gang's pretty alright.[N]
Beyond just the money, even.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That offer I gave ya is[N]
still on the table, bud.[A][N]
Stay with me long as you[N]
like when this is done.[A][N]
A day. A month. A life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A life, you say?[A][N]
[...]Do go on.[OpenMidRight]
[...]I just felt things'd get[N]
boring and lonely without ya.[A][N]
Course, if you wouldn't want[N]
to stay a life,[A] I could pick[N]
up the ol' mercenary boots.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Seems you're really into me[N]
stayin' around.[A][ToggleSmile] Guess I[N]
could make that 'appen.[A][N]
[...]What's causin' this?[N]
Chiseled good looks?[A][N]
Charming wit? Can't keep[N]
yourself away from me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Mayhaps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. I'll give[N]
you a try, bud.[A][N]
[...]A bit more rugged than my[N]
usual. I can get behind that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Heh. [...]Let's get on with[N]
this fightin' business.[A][N]
I'll show off to ya later.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You can show off by fightin'.[N]
I'll be sure to myself.[A][X]

##C28_Apollo_Flynn_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Apollo. Might[...][N]
Might I speak to you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, Flynn.[N]
What is it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I wish to remain[N]
by your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
After this war? Of course.[A][N]
I believe we had discussed our[N]
plans to travel together.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Ah. [...]Right.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Is that alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]I[...] truly care about you.[N]
Deeply and fondly.[A][N]
You've always been[...] so kind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps I'm being hasty.[A][N]
[...]But if you'd be alright[N]
with having me[...][A][N]
I think I[...] might like to[N]
spend my life with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] truly honored.[A][N]
If you feel you wouldn't[N]
tire of my company[...][A][N]
I would like that very much.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad.[A][N]
[...]What now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. We ought to prepare.[N]
I know we'll survive together.[A][N]
And then, we can see all we wish[N]
to see in the world.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A]That we will.[A][X]

##C28_Leila_Wilhelm_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
[...]You alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
About as well as one can be when they[N]
have to fight their dead colleagues.[A][N]
[...]You?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd hope I'm doing better.[N]
If I weren't, that'd be[...] sad.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And yet, you'd make a big deal[N]
out of something far more tame.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]How exactly ARE you keeping[N]
things together now?[A][N]
I[...] I don't know if I'd be[N]
able to function if I were you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It helps having at least one[N]
person you care for not dead.[A][N]
[...]That being you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Flattered. Truly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, really. You and me.[N]
We're one and the same.[A][N]
We get each other.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Guess so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Say. If we live through this,[N]
wanna grab a meal?[A][N]
See what happens from there?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Huh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just figured I'd ask.[A][N]
May as well get a date out[N]
of you before I die.[A][N]
[...]Who knows when that'll be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sure.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]I'll treat you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's unlike you.[N]
Not that I mind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're right. You do get me.[N]
And I get you.[A][N]
[...]I might be stubborn, but I[N]
won't throw away trying.[A][N]
[...]You're a lucky man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Heh. Maybe for once.[A][X]

##C28_Emile_Vladmir_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
You appear troubled. I more[N]
than understand why.[A][N]
[...]If you wish, we all can[N]
undertake your burden.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] alright. I need to[N]
confront this.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]It hurts, but I know if[N]
I run away from him,[A][N]
I'll regret not being here[N]
for[...] however it ends.[A][N]
I'm still[...] thankful for[N]
where he's gotten me.[A][N]
But I know deep down that he's[N]
done too much to be forgiven.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]He teaches us that no bridge can[N]
be irreparably burned.[A][N]
But forgiveness is not a one-sided[N]
affair.[A] If Elcorian doesn't[N]
recognize his wrongs,[A][N]
there is nothing he would gain[N]
from absolution.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Perhaps I draw too much upon scripture[N]
instead of our time's wisdom.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]No, you're right.[A][N]
[...]Sorry to bother,[N]
Archbishop.[A][N]
But thanks for listening.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Such inner turmoil.[N]
I wish I could do more.[A][X]

##C28_Arin_Yuyu_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYuyu][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
Welp. I'm settled on this.[A][N]
Burning this whole place[N]
to the ground later.[A][N]
Wanna join?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]To play devil's advocate,[A][N]
wouldn't burning it down[N]
now be more efficient?[A][N]
We get out, start a fire, and[N]
our enemies perish within?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Woah. You're more brutal[N]
than I ever imagined.[A][N]
[...]But that takes away some[N]
of the satisfaction.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it makes you feel better,[N]
I was being hypothetical.[A][N]
We're better than our enemy.[A][N]
Consigning them to a fiery[N]
death would disprove that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I disagree, but that's[N]
beyond the point.[A][N]
[...]I want to savor the end of my[N]
tormentors as long as possible.[A][N]
Am I[...] Am I wrong for that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I wouldn't say so.[A][N]
Anger's natural. Wanting[N]
revenge is natural.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps your glee's a[N]
bit unnatural.[A][N]
But it's[...] charming.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I live to charm.[A][N]
Anyway, guess before we burn,[N]
we're gonna have to win.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadArin]
You've got this, me.[N]
And you've got this, you.[A][N]
No more loose ends.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]No more loose ends indeed.[A][X]

##C28_Mikey_Joan_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadJoan][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm ready for this to be over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aren't we all, Mikey?[A][N]
What're you plannin' to[N]
do after this, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you mean? I'd go back[N]
home with you, naturally.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Really? Thought you weren't[N]
all that big on Yg'stra.[A][N]
I don't want to hold you[N]
back.[A] We might be family,[N]
but sometimes you gotta fly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've had[...] ample flying.[A][N]
I think some of a simple life[N]
back home might do me well.[A][N]
[...]Guess Yg'stra's not exactly a[N]
simple place right now, though.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Might never be again.[A][N]
Heck, maybe it was never[N]
what you'd call simple.[A][N]
We're still digging up threads[N]
of some conspiracy.[A][N]
[...]I'll admit, I'm sometimes[N]
overwhelmed by these findings.[A][N]
But I know it'll be worth it[N]
for a brighter Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]A brighter Yg'stra[...][N]
Sounds nice.[A][N]
We'll make it happen, Joan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That we will, brother.[A][X]

##C28_Secret_Seller
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJake5]
Well, lassie. This is a bit sad.[N]
I fear this may be the last we speak.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's truly a shame.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, let's get on with it.[N]
The final patented shop hint![A][N]
[...]Well, actually. This is[N]
quite awkward.[A][N]
No real way to say it that wouldn't[N]
just ruin the whole mystery.[A][N]
It's[...] pretty obvious, really.[A][N]
You could ask me for some kind[N]
of riddle that'd hint at it[...][A][N]
Or you could just use the warp staff.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'll just[...] head out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No, I mean it. Even if[...][N]
the hints were a bit goofy.[A][N]
It's nice knowing these shops[N]
exist at all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Thanks, lassie. Anyhoot,[N]
I gotta go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's been good to know you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Godspeed. I[...] just know you can do anything[N]
you set your mind to, lassie.[A][N]
Anna and I are proud to have[N]
helped you on your journey.[A][N]
And you too, person behind the[N]
screen.[A] [...]Thanks for coming[N]
along on this incredible journey.[A][N]
[...]Have a swell day![A][X]
