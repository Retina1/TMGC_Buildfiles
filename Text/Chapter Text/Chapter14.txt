##_Ch14Seize
Seize the throne,[N]
and end this war.[X]

##C14TheChoice
Kill the emperor by[N]
your own hand?[N]
[Yes][X]

##ObtainTheHandle
A small tomb lies beyond[N]
the open door.[A][N]
Though you wish not to disturb[N]
it, something catches your eye.[A][N]
...On the ground lies a long[N]
thin rod, like an axe's handle.[A][X]

##Arc1Ending
And so comes the end of an era.[A][N]
The flames of war that had burned[N]
across Ulmaron,[A] just as quickly as[N]
they rose, have been doused.[A][N]
Emperor Briant's dying words ring[N]
clear as day in Blair's mind,[A][N]
but before she can dwell too long[N]
on what meaning they hold,[A][N]
she must return to Elba Cor[N]
and Dalst,[A] as to decide the[N]
fate of Yg'stra's lands.[A][N]
Of course, the echoes of darkness[N]
naught stay silent for long.[A][N]
But before any of that...[A][N]
Another story must be told.[N]
A story of a grand reunion.[A][N]
A story of a young man realizing[N]
his destiny. The story... of Zeke.[A][X]

##Ch14_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's time, Blair. Have you made[N]
your final preparations?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I have.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone. Thank you for coming this far.[N]
Today, we bring an end to this war.[A][N]
I know this has been a long and painful[N]
journey, and I'm sorry.[A][N]
But hopefully, this is our[N]
final battle.[A][N]
I call upon you all to lend me[N]
your strength, and bring victory![A][X]

##Ch14_CharleyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
You're Blair, right? I feel like[N]
we might've met before.[A][N]
The name's Charley. I've joined[N]
up with Opistia to help you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad to hear that.[N]
I see you've got quite the large bow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, yes. It's certainly unwieldy,[N]
but its range is unmatched.[A][N]
Whatever you need done, I can[N]
handle for you.[A][X]

##Ch14_AthenaTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, we meet again after all.[N]
You were in the capital.[A][N]
I'm Athena, if you don't recall.[A][N]
The archbishop sent a few your way,[N]
and, well, here I am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good. I shall be off to battle now.[N]
Guide me well.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
He's finally dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
for everyone he's murdered.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately, he's not our true target.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Of course. I'm sure the emperor's somewhere[N]
in this palace. We just need to keep searching.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Be cautious. By definition, the emperor[N]
is the strongest man in the country.[A][N]
Given how close this battle was, I fear[N]
to imagine what he's capable of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We've come too[N]
far to come back now.[A][X]

##Ch14_Ending1
[OpenMidRight][LoadBriant]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, this is the end of Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What was everything I sacrificed?[A][N]
What was this war all for?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Valden[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Lazarus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Where did you falter?[A][N]
It's all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so distant[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Ch14_Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've done well to make it[N]
this far, young lady.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I presume you'd be the emperor?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That'd be correct[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Emperor Briant.[A][N]
Though I'm far from deserving[N]
of that title now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Enough talk! Why did you invade Elba Cor?[N]
What do you have to gain from this?[A][N]
Where did you take the soldiers of Aercolyn?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Tell me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Why did you do all of this?[N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] TELL ME![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. The truth mustn't[N]
perish with me.[A][N][OpenEyes]
We must start at the beginning of this[N]
sorrowful tale. Several months back.[A][N]
It all began with a messenger from[N]
the shadows.[A] A figure clad in darkness,[N]
delivering me an ominous message.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]An omen of destruction.[A][N]
I felt to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ignore it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
After all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No truth could[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
possibly have existed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] within those words[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Destruction?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a small village. Where[N]
I grew up. Where I learned to fight.[A][N]
A message arrived, but by the time I[N]
was there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Nothing remained.[A][N]
Upon my return to the palace, more[N]
from the shadows accosted me.[A][N]
Except[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What was I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] possibly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
to do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] Their words[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
They had forced me to frame the village's[N]
destruction on Elba Cor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
and use it as a pretense to invade.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] could anyone[N]
have to gain from this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] In any case, that is why[N]
the Dalstian negotiations ran dry.[A][N]
Those within the shadows lent us[N]
a fragment of their power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You say that your soldiers vanished?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's possible that power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]And pray tell, who are these[N]
agents behind the scenes?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry. In attempting to[N]
save my own nation,[A] I've become the ruin[N]
of the entire continent.[A][N]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've told all I can.[N]
There's but one thing left for you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've won this war. But your path[N]
forward lies upon my grave.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you cannot bring yourself[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] over for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I've nothing left in this world.[A][N]
My home[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My generals[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My pride[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] All forsaken.[A][N]
You've still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] got a path[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
ahead of you. A land to save.[A][N]
But I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] said enough[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] make your decision.[A][X]

##Ch14_EndingKill
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye, emperor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's your choice, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm glad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you've the will[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
to carve[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] your own path.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Here I come.[A][X]

##Ch14_EndingSpare
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadBriant][OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can't do it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Very well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I suppose[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it falls[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm glad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to leave the world[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
to one[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] kind as you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidRight]
Urgh![A][N]
Glory[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Ch14_EndingFinal
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's finally over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This doesn't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] feel right.[N]
What was this all for?[A][N]
And what do we do now?[A][N]
The emperor is dead, yet we've[N]
more questions than answers.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] troubling, to be sure.[N]
But we've more important things to do.[A][N]
With the end of a war comes much to rebuild.[N]
Both in our land, and here.[A][N]
I recommend we return to Elba Cor.[A][N]
It makes a convenient location for[N]
post-war talk, given the involved parties.[A][N]
I'll send out messengers to Opistia[N]
and Dalst.[A] As for you, I believe[N]
you ought to address the troops.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. It's over, and that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's cause to celebrate, if only a bit.[A][X]

##C14PreScriptedBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it now, Lazarus?[N]
You're hardly fit to be here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I had come to apologize.[N]
I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] several regrets.[A][N]
And I wish to fight for Yg'stra again.[N]
On that note, where is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Arkhinal? It has been sealed away.[N]
I'm not at liberty to disclose where.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I wouldn't even if I could.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if you're sincere about your[N]
desire to fight again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And you truly understand the error[N]
of your ways[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] There may be[N]
a soldier's path ahead for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you for this chance.[A][N]
But, you do have one thing wrong.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And what would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My path[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is not one of a soldier.[A][N]
It is one[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] of a conqueror.[N]
Of a living god.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I believe this is where we part ways.[A][X]

##C14ValdenDies
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus][OpenMidRight][LoadValden][CloseEyes]
Gah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] traitor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]
What, you call me a traitor? For what?[N]
For following my own path?[A][N]
For seeking glory? Is that not what[N]
everyone's here for? Glory and power?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is so much[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
never understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] You are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
truly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] weak[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
Pah! Why do I listen to the[N]
ramblings of a dead man?[A][N][MoveRight]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Urgh![A][X]

##C14LazarusMoment
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
At last[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How glorious.[A][N]
Just gotta think of a way to explain[N]
this to the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] And then[N]
the world shall be mine.[A][N]
Perhaps I'd be able to take him[N]
on if I had Arkhinal,[A] but that bastard[N]
just had to get in my way one last time.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14OpenDeadValden
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the Dalstians did you in, Valden.[N]
Damn. I was hoping to do that myself.[A][N]
Alas. At least it makes my life all[N]
the simpler.[A] I'd say I feel bad,[N]
but I don't. At all.[A][N]
You were weak, Valden.[N]
That's why you died.[A][N]
As for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Need I say more?[A][N]
I'm the strongest man in this[N]
entire fucking empire![A][N]
With the emperor as he is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's nobody better suited[N]
to take this throne than I.[A][N][Event]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest. How glorious.[A][N]
Of course, that bastard just had to[N]
get in my way one last time.[A][N]
Hid Arkhinal away and took its[N]
location to the grave. Alas.[A][N]
Maybe I'll scour the palace for it[N]
later, and take all that's mine.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14AthenaCharleyJoin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And here we are.[A][N]
I'd say this is above my pay grade,[N]
but, hey. At least it's exciting.[A][N]
Moreso than border-guarding.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can let go of me now.[N]
We're here.[A][N][Event][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Apologies. Never've been the[N]
most[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comfortable flier.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I may ask, why[N]
did you want to come along?[A][N]
Surely, you can do more personally[N]
fulfilling things than war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For a long time, I've felt like I've[N]
wandered without a purpose.[A][N]
This might be what I've been looking[N]
for all this time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. Enough talking. The lady's[N]
party should be nearby.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. It's all up to us.[A][X]


##C14SwitchHint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier4]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I standing here, again?[A][N]
Commander Valden told me sternly to[N]
not move from this spot,[A][N]
lest the enemy enable this switch that[N]
makes the throne sink into the floor.[A][N]
But why wouldn't he want that?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That just sounds cool.[A][N]
Alas. I'm not one to defy him.[N]
Hopefully he's doing alright.[A][X]

##C14Spooky
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenFarFarRight][LoadElcorian]
Are you sure this is quite[N]
alright, Girard?[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Relax. Nobody will see us from[N]
here, and even if someone does[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, we're more than capable of[N]
fending them off.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
So, it appears this war is coming[N]
to an end. I expected nothing less.[A][N]
In any case, the plan must keep[N]
moving forward.[A] For the sake[N]
of the future.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
No need to be so apprehensive.[A][N]
Come, now. We ought to be off[N]
back to our homeland.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies.[A][N][OpenFarFarLeft]
Don't worry about it, friend.[A][X]

##nothroneha
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
What the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Did the throne just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
disappear from under me?[A][N]
What sorcery is this!?[N]
Who built that into the palace?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter.[A][N]
If those Dalstians think they can[N]
take me down with their tricks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, I'll prove them dead wrong.[A][X]

What, too scared to speak?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hardly.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You are going to suffer[N]
for all that you've done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
You think you can[N]
kill me?[A] Hah![N]
Put on a good show, then.[A][X]

You look like Joan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
No matter. I'll end her too,[N]
if need be.[A][N]

##C14LazarusCarbonBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Well, Lazarus. You don't know me.[N]
But I know you. I never liked you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
Well, I DON'T know you, and I[N]
can say I detest you.[A][N]
So I guess we're even.[ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon]
Wrong. One of us is[N]
about to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLazarus]
