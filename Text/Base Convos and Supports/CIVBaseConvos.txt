I've just realized something.[N]
I've hardly heard you perform.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're you talking about?[N]
I play for you all the time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but that's in combat.[A][N]
Your invigorating melody is wondrous,[N]
of course[...][A] But it pales to what[N]
you can do in peace.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Really? I[...] never thought of it[N]
as notably different.[A][N]
Whether I play to hasten our[N]
allies or to unwind at night[...][A][N]
It's all music to me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I suppose, then, that it's the rest[N]
of us who see it differently.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. The beauty of the notes[N]
can be[...] hard to grasp.[A][N]
If you wish, after this fight,[N]
I could perform for you.[A][N]
Perhaps experiment with this new[N]
piece I've been learning.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That sounds like just what I[N]
need. What's it called, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] haven't named it, yet.[A][N]
Perhaps once you hear it, you[N]
could think of something fitting.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Big responsibility, there.[N]
But I won't let you down.[A][X]

##V4_Eliza_Rose_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEliza][OpenMidRight][LoadRose][OpenMidLeft]
Hiya, Rose! What're you doing?[N]
Are those[...] herbs?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm trying something.[A][N]
And thinking. You should[N]
give that a try sometime.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh! Are you making some[N]
new herbal remedy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Less a remedy. More[N]
a[...] supercharger.[A][N]
See this plant? It's quite toxic.[N]
But if I trim it like so[...][A][N]
I'm left with its stem[...][N]
A potent stimulant.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] incredible![A][N]
But it looks like you missed[N]
a little spot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So I did. You would've[N]
lived if this made it in.[A][N]
[...]Probably.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can[...] Can you teach me some[N]
of this science?[A][N]
I could[...] help us all![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'd[...] rather not spill[N]
my techniques.[A][N]
[...]But I'll look into making[N]
what you want.[A][N]
If you help me, that is.[N]
Gathering's[...] boring.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sounds like fun, Rose![N]
I'd be glad to help.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Excellent. We have a deal, then.[A][X]

##V4_Manfred_Wilhelm_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
I must say[...] This is the life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's liberating, for sure.[N]
Not that the army was bad.[A][N]
But freedom's[...] nice.[A][N]
That, and since we're always[N]
on the move,[A] we're always[N]
ahead of the debtors.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't you mean YOU'RE always[N]
ahead of the debtors?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You'd help me fight off[N]
a loan shark, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Oof. Well, you're right.[N]
It's my problem.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How'd you end up with all[N]
of that debt anyway?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The whims of fate.[A][N]
[...]And my nonexistent poker face.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup. I can see that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I'm sure you've got[N]
skeletons in your closet.[A][N]
We've known each other for[N]
a long time. Give me the dirt.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My life's not that exciting.[A][N]
That's part of why I'm here.[N]
That, and that blasted heat.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. You lived in the[N]
desert.[A] [...]Why do you hate[N]
the scorching, grainy-[A][N]
Wait. Never mind. I hate it[N]
just describing it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Exactly! Plus, I've never been[N]
the most[...] religious.[A][N]
So I've little reason to stay put.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, if we're both wandering this[N]
vast and unforgiving world,[A][N]
may as well do it together.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well spoken, friend.[A][X]

##V4_Rift_Estelle_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenMidRight][LoadEstelle]
Ah, Rift! Just who I wished to see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What troubles you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly a trouble. I've been[N]
struck by inspiration.[A][N]
But to fully realize it, I[N]
must rely on your expertise.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Go on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you recall that play[N]
that I am a part of?[A][N]
[OpenQuote]Dawn's Maiden and the[N]
Champion of Radiance[CloseQuote]?[A][N]
One of its climactic moments is[N]
the Champion of Radiance,[A][N]
in spectacular fashion, dueling the[N]
man who struck down his father.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Where do I come in?[N]
I don't act.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, you see[...] I was thinking[N]
you could coach our swordplay.[A][N]
The skills of a real duelist[...][A][N]
They'd let our production transcend[N]
beyond any that I've seen.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Sure.[A][N]
What's my pay?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your pay is the joy of spreading[N]
quality theater in Mevion![A][N]
The gasps of the crowd as blades[N]
clash with unbound realism![A][N]
That[...] is what performers strive[N]
to achieve.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I meant money, Estelle.[A][N]
[...]Though, my name being[N]
immortalized ain't half bad.[A][X]
