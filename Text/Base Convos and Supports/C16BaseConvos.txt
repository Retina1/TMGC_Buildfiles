[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
It's good to see you well, Sam.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
S-Same to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh! Your bow you lent me a[N]
while back[...][A][N]
For my staff I was researching[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Was[...] Was it helpful?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Quite.[A][N]
The flex offered by your bow's material[N]
gave me the insight I needed.[A][N]
Of course, it's still somewhat on[N]
the experimental side,[A][N]
but this is still a massive step[N]
forward for my research.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad.[A][N]
I've always felt like[...] I've[N]
been holding us back[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's hardly true. You're as[N]
valuable a soldier as a friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]T-thanks. That makes me[N]
feel better.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. [...]I'll keep you updated[N]
on my progress, if you'd like.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If that would make you happy[...][N]
It wouldn't bother at all.[A][X]

##C16_Cassius_Athena_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadAthena]
Cassius. You've been staring at[N]
me for five minutes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, apologies. I'm just wondering how[N]
the hell you fight on that thing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]My wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Half the time, I can barely keep[N]
myself balanced on my horse.[A][N]
Can't possibly imagine keeping it[N]
together on a flying horse.[A][N]
With scales.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]A flying horse. With scales.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't that basically a wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]How would you describe it?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
A battle hardened creature of duty.[N]
A potent extension of a rider's will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Those're just more ways to describe a horse![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I think I'll go now.[N]
Your wyvern looks[...] hungry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good idea, strange man.[A][X]

##C16_Carbon_Mikey_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCarbon][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][OpenMidLeft]
Gotta say, Mikey. Surprised we're[N]
still here and fighting.[A][N]
Seems like the last thing you'd[N]
want to be doing now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I know. But how're[N]
we supposed to leave now?[A][N]
And, besides[...] I'm sure it's just[N]
as chaotic back home.[A][N]
What, with the emperor gone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, that's gonna be a hell of[N]
a time, replacing him.[A][N]
Think I could handle it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No offense, Carbon, but you'd probably[N]
get snapped in half in the first round.[A][N]
You'd never survive the tournament.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So true. Hm[...] What about[N]
your sister?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Joan? She'd have[...] a decent shot.[N]
But I don't know if I'd want that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What, you wouldn't want to be the[N]
emperor's brother?[A] That sounds[N]
like the coolest thing ever.[A][N]
And I'd be[...] the emperor's[N]
brother's best friend![A][N]
That's worth at least a few[N]
favors, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I suppose it is.[A][X]

##C16_Blair_Avan_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, there! You're one of[N]
the prince's, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That'd be correct, milady.[A][N]
He happened upon[...] an acquaintance[N]
and I, and came to our aid.[A][N]
So now, here we are.[N]
I'm Avan, by the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's nice to finally talk to you.[N]
[...]You probably know, but I'm Blair.[A][N]
I must say, that flower in your[N]
hair is truly remarkable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you. I happened upon it[N]
in Mevion,[A] and it was simply[N]
too beautiful to pass up.[A][N]
I've been keeping it alive the[N]
past few months with my staves.[A][N]
[...]Who knew they worked[N]
on plants?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wow[...] That's pretty[N]
spectacular.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's a nice reminder of my homeland.[A][N]
No matter where I may wander, this[N]
flower'll be by my side.[A][N]
Well, not my side. You know[N]
what I mean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, I get it. It sounds comforting.[N]
[...]Hm[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's nothing too important.[N]
Just[...] an idea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[...] Well, battle's on[N]
the horizon.[A][N]
I'll leave you to think about[N]
whatever you're scheming.[A][N]
It was great finally getting[N]
to talk to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same to you, Avan![A][X]

##C16_Blair_Carbon_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCarbon][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Lady Blair! It's good to[N]
see you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Hello, Carbon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's that tone for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you wish to grace me[N]
with more[...] moves?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Perhaps. But if you don't[N]
like them, that's fine.[A][N]
There's more to the Carbon experience.[N]
Take a look at this![A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight]
Are those[...] sketches?[N]
They're[...] marvelous![A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's a[...] side venture. In order[N]
to perfect my form,[A][N]
I've taken to studying anatomy,[N]
and to aid in that,[A][N]
what better than to sketch[N]
out my technique?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]It's not as good as you think.[A][N][OpenRight]
Nonsense! This is briliant![N]
Now I[...] Now I feel bad.[A][N]
About earlier.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
All's fair. I get I can be[...][N]
overwhelming.[A][N]
But, hey. If you want to talk[N]
more, I'd always be glad.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course. That sounds nice.[A][X]

##C16_Natasia_Bechamel_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia][OpenMidLeft]
Lassie! 'ow you been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been pretty excellent.[N]
But, you know what?[A][N]
I demand a rematch. Remember[N]
our spar in the desert?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, how could I not, matey?[A][N]
Felled ya in a single swing o'[N]
me axe, I did.[A][N]
And then ye made some brilliantly[N]
seared fish, as promised![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, pal. You got lucky. But[N]
I'll get ya this time![A][N]
And then[...] Well, we can give[N]
your cooking a test![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Arr, I wouldn't subjact ye[N]
ta that, mate.[A][N]
Ye ever 'eard of hardtack?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That sounds[...] edible?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure is. All ye need is water,[N]
flour, and heat![A][N]
Simple enough that even me and[N]
me mates cannae flub it up![A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Fine. We'll still rematch.[N]
But I'll cook again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Good choice, lassie. Let's just say there[N]
be reason I don't have all me teeth.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Well, make sure not to lose a few[N]
more today. You're not taking me down![A][X]

##C16_Rachael_Leila_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeila][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, what do we have here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hello, Leila.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that all you're going to say?[N]
All you'll say to me?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]What do you want?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing, really. I just remember how[N]
you used to look up to me.[A][N]
Back when I was your age.[N]
It was[...] cute, almost.[A][N]
And now look where your idol[N]
among the Elba Corian knights is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you have a purpose here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't you despise me? Don't you[N]
despise yourself for looking up to me?[A][N]
I am EVERYTHING you hate![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It is[...] good to see you well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So, that's how it is.[N]
Nothing from her.[A][X]

##C16_Peggy_Butch_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy][OpenMidLeft]
I'm surprised you're still here, Peggy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's that supposed to mean, old man?[N]
I'm surprised you're not dead![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Touche. I'm just saying, I thought[N]
you'd have stopped fighting by now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And why would I do that? I'm doing[N]
good things, and having a good time.[A][N]
I've probably said this before, but I'd[N]
much rather this than rotting in a church.[A][N]
Can't believe I put up with that for so long.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, I feel ya'. In a way, I'm glad[N]
the conflict's not truly over.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I[...] I'm not sure I can go[N]
back to how things used to be.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Yeah.[A][X]
