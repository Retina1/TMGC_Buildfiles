Greetings, General Neillstrom.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's an honor to see you, your majesty.[N]
Apologies for Lord Arbordia's absence.[A][N]
I trust my presence here to be[N]
satisfactory?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. You're Dalst's most reputable[N]
man when it comes to military.[A][N]
If I may ask, who is that with you?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah, right. I am Elcorian. One of[N]
Arbordia's peers.[A][N]
Call me an envoy, I suppose.[A][N]
I felt my presence here would be valuable,[N]
especially given my familiarity with Blair.[A][N]
On that note, it's good to see you well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Thank you, Elcorian. That means a lot.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadVladmir]
And of course, I shall speak[N]
for Opistia in these talks.[A][N]
Though, my people wish to pull out[N]
of Yg'stra as soon as possible.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I would agree. The last thing Elba Cor[N]
needs is more territory to worry about.[A][N]
Especially when we don't even quite[N]
know why this war began.[A][N][OpenLeft]
If[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If I may. Before the emperor perished[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He'd mentioned something.[A][N]
Some kind of dark force from[N]
within the shadows.[A][N]
Pulling the strings of this war.[N]
Forcing him to invade to save his people.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadNeillstrom]
Interesting. Perhaps his words held weight.[A][N]
Or perhaps they were the ramblings of[N]
a madman.[A] Either way, Yg'stra needs[N]
some kind of order, now.[A][N]
Luckily, Arbordia prepared a contingency[N]
plan for this event.[A][N]
If there are no objections, the Dalstian[N]
army shall occupy Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]One moment, please.[A][N]
If I'm not mistaken[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] By Yg'stran law,[N]
the strongest is the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And if Blair overcame the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
Are you saying I'm technically the[N]
emperor of Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps if their society recognizes you[N]
as such[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
That's absurd, Elcorian.[N]
Do you truly believe-[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm just saying, that could lend[N]
an air of legitimacy to this.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]continue writing later[A][X]

There you are, Kenneth. Don't go and[N]
think you can hide from your dad![A][X]

##I5InnText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Distant Cutlass,[CloseQuote] Couria's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N]
Well, we're different. Whenever the[N]
king needs to drown his sorrows[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, he certainly walks by our door.[N]
Haven't convinced him to come in. Yet.[A][N]
But maybe today's the day! You[N]
wouldn't want to miss it.[A][X]
