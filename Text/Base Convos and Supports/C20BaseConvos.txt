[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think. It's been such[N]
a tiring road.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't disagree there. But it's[N]
as I've said before.[A][N]
I shall stand by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Couldn't you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be more[N]
than that?[A][N]
Your skills are unparalleled.[N]
Surely[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would I leave you to seek glory?[N]
I'm content to be by your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I know. I'm just afraid[N]
that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this'll never end.[A][N]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm leading all of us[N]
into some kind of oblivion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're doing as well as you can.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We trust you.[A][N]
That's why we're still here.[A][N]
You don't try to act as some flawless[N]
leader[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Someone incomparable.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you. And that earnestness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It comforts us all.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] struggled, sometimes, to[N]
affirm my purpose.[A][N]
But you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a great purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] needed that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Let's not dawdle.[N]
We've ruins to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ToggleSmile]
Well, hopefully not ruin.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought that was funny.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never change, please.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What now?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe you're not wrong, mister.[N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a good guy.[A][N]
Despite your dark magic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm truly humbled.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why do you use darkness?[N]
We're a force of good![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There's more subtlety to magic[N]
than just good or evil.[A][N]
That's why many, including I,[N]
prefer to call it elder magic.[A][N]
It's quite unfair to write it off[N]
as the product of madmen,[A][N]
when it is in fact a rich field[N]
about the essence of the world.[A][N]
Any magic can produce calamity if[N]
left unchecked.[A][N]
In fact, any THING can in general,[N]
if these ruins are any indication.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As you said, though. We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
the good guys.[A][N]
Nothing'll happen under our watch.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right, mister.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's fine. Now, then. Let's[N]
show them what we can do.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you satisfied?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean? Should[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Should I not ask that of you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Touche. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't get you.[A][N]
I'm a self-serving nuisance.[N]
So maybe I never will.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Don't you want more?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I am satisfied to serve my[N]
homeland with pride.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, though. That sounds[N]
antithetical to a knight.[A][N]
Pride[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's the self-serving[N]
shlock I can get behind.[A][N]
So why in the hell do knights[N]
fight for pride?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I guess if I were to rephrase it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's less my own pride[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And more pride for my homeland.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's there to be proud of? It's a[N]
bunch of land and buildings.[A][N]
All represented by whatever family was[N]
lucky enough to have [OpenQuote]royal blood.[CloseQuote][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you have no pride for Mevion?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nope. But that's my problem.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll never get you.[A][N]
But, hey. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I tried.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is there any reason you're[N]
less coarse today, by the by?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Honestly, who the hell knows.[N]
And who the hell cares.[A][X]

Oi! Cyclops![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's an affectionate Lowland[N]
original nickname.[A][N]
Wear it wit' pride![A][N]
Anyways, what're you starin'[N]
into space for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] thinking. These ruins are some of[N]
the only remains of old Holanis.[A][N]
Will[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Will Gohranian Holanis end[N]
up in ruins too, perhaps?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're a daft one. Why worry about[N]
the fall of a non-existent society?[A][N]
Perhaps actually start your society[N]
first, no?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It still bears thought, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look, when yer like me, only[N]
one thing bears thought.[A][N]
How'll I make it through the day.[N]
You could learn from that.[A][N]
No point in thinkin' of a future[N]
when yer gonna get chopped today.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The audacity of that woman.[N]
Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see what she means.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We have to fight both[N]
for now and for tomorrow.[A][X]
