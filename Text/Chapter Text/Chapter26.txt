[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]Ethyl has fallen.[A][N]
Her might, and my simulacra[...][N]
They were not enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]A pity. There is not much[N]
time left, then.[A][N]
When Aercolyn arrives, I will take[N]
defense of the city.[A][N]
I ask you to defend the hall[N]
with your masterpieces.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And leave you to risk your[N]
life alone, Girard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will not throw my life away[N]
so foolishly.[A] Not like[N]
Tarquin or Ethyl.[A][N]
I will wear them down, and lure[N]
them into our clutches.[A][N]
You can[...] make all needed[N]
preparations.[A] [...]I know you've[N]
long been adamant.[A][N]
To sway her to our side.[A][N]
I fear this may be your final[N]
chance.[A] And you know how[N]
your talk with her went.[A][N]
[...]I sometimes wonder why you[N]
keep trying.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Whichever way things proceed, there[N]
will be none to oppose us.[A][N]
[...]The future I've long seen draws[N]
nearer and nearer.[A][X]

##C26End2EthylAlive
[OpenFarLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss][OpenFarLeft]
Ah, Ethyl. I see you've[N]
returned.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately for all of us,[N]
this was an absolute failure.[A][N]
Aercolyn still lives, despite[N]
our best efforts.[A][N]
Even your simulacra proved rather[N]
worthless in the end, Elcorian.[A][N]
Bit of a shame.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It is what it is.[A][N]
A normal simulacrum is formed[N]
from a corpse.[A] To make them[N]
in the image of someone living[...][A][N]
I suppose the methods I used[N]
still need some refining.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
At least I got some field[N]
data I was looking for.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Field data? What of?[A][N]
Far as I recall, the only[N]
data you needed was for[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
Annihilation, no?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
The tome which I explicitly said[N]
we were above using?[A][N]
A power which may or may not lead[N]
to immense collateral damages?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It was[...] the simplest[N]
way to get this done.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Simple. And yet, you failed.[A][N]
You defied direct orders to use the[N]
deadliest animus I've ever seen[...][A][N]
And failed to kill a single noblewoman[N]
and her princely friend.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]It's a shame things had to end[N]
like this, Ethyl.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]What do you mean, end?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's as I've said. Our future[N]
demands sacrifice.[A] And at[N]
this moment in time,[A][N]
I believe your sacrifice will[N]
bring about our best future.[A][N]
Besides, when we bring you back,[N]
we can see how powerful you become.[A][N]
[...]You can consider that an honor.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Still, it'd be a shame for me[N]
to do this to a longtime friend.[A][N]
[...]Elcorian, if you will.[A][N][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenMidRight]
Urgh! Elc[...]orian[...][A][N][OpenRight]
[...]What you've done will[N]
not go to waste.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[...][A][CloseEyes] Girard[...][A][N]
Did it all[...] mean[...][N]
nothing[...] to you[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Farewell.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadElcorian][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Let us not dwell on what[N]
has come before.[A][N]
We've the issue of what is next.[A][N]
[...]When Aercolyn arrives, I will take[N]
defense of the city.[A][N]
I ask you to defend the hall[N]
with your masterpieces.[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
And leave you to risk your[N]
life alone, Girard?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I will not throw my life away[N]
so foolishly.[A] Not like[N]

I will wear them down, and lure[N]
them into our clutches.[A][N]
You can[...] make all needed[N]

Whichever way things proceed, there[N]
will be none to oppose us.[A][N]
[...]The future I've long seen draws[N]
nearer and nearer.[A][X]

##C26Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
That was[...] a lot to deal with.[N]
Even without Neillstrom[...][A][N]
Dalst will be a formidable foe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then we must be decisive.[A][N]
Once we're all recovered, we're[N]
off to take Arbordia.[A][N]
It's a bit of a ways away,[N]
but the road should be clear.[A][N]
And now that we're on the[N]
offensive,[A] I'm sure they'll[N]
have pulled back into the city.[A][N]
I'd say this pains me,[A][N]
but it would pain me further to[N]
let this go on longer than needed.[A][N]
[...]Elcorian and Girard will not[N]
let this end in peace.[A][N]
Not as long as they're alive.[A][N]
And even if they would live to[N]
see this war brought to a close[...][A][N]
Nothing is stopping them from[N]
repeating their mistakes.[A][N]
From betraying the people of[N]
Aercolyn once again.[A][N]
From threatening the continent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Before we prepare[N]
to set off again,[A] I'd just[N]
like to see my father again.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBrandl]
I'm right here, son.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]
Ah! Father![A][N]
I[...] just wanted to see[N]
you off.[A] We're marching[N]
on Arbordia soon.[A][N][CloseEyes]
It may just be our most[N]
treacherous battle,[A][N]
but it is one we must[N]
win at any cost.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I know what you're thinking.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
It's alright, Zeke. I know that[N]
you'll come back home safe.[A][N]
You've already done so many[N]
truly fantastic things.[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
[...]I hope you're right, father.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I'll be off, then. There's[N]
no time to spare.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
What of you, Blair?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you mean?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you nervous about the[N]
road ahead?[A] I'm certain[N]
you two will prevail.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] don't want to doubt myself, either.[A][N]
[...]But I've asked myself what this will[N]
all mean.[A] Everything I've done stemmed[N]
from[...] From wanting to prove myself.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Prove myself to this[...] wicked state.[N]
That saw me as an expendable tool.[A][N]
What[...] What do I have now? What will[N]
I have left after Arbordia's down?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
With all due respect, I see[N]
that as a foolish question.[A][N]
You saved the land from Yg'stra[N]
and liberated your people.[A][N]
I'd call those some truly[N]
worthy deeds.[A] And if you're[N]
asking about proving yourself[...][A][N]
Who do you actually need to prove[N]
yourself to at this point?[A][N]
I'd wager you've more than shown[N]
you're worthy of what you wish to do.[A][N]
That's why you've come this far.[N]
Why so many have brought you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I appreciate it, Your Majesty.[A][N][OpenEyes]
You're right. It's no longer about[N]
proving myself to anybody.[A][N]
This war's about more than me.[N]
It's about all of Dalst.[A][N]
All of Ulmaron, really.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I must return to Elba Cor.[N]
I trust you'll return in triumph.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We can only hope, Your Majesty.[A][X]

##C26KennethAscend
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth]
[...]As I expected.[A][N]
My apologies for being late.[N]
And perhaps it wasn't worth it.[A][N]
What few remained in Neillstrom[N]
would not heed my call.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]But that is irrelevant now.[N]
I've long known I need none of that.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I've come this far under my own[N]
power. Under my own will.[A][N]
And continue under it I will.[A][N]
[...]I'm sure he would've wanted me to[N]
wear this under different circumstances.[A][N]
But I shall don this armor in the[N]
name of myself.[A] Not in the name[N]
of Neillstrom.[A][N]
And with it, and the pinnacle of[N]
my scholarly works[...][A][N]
I will show Dalst who I am.[A][N]
Perhaps they will respect me.[N]
Perhaps they will fear me.[A][N]
Perhaps nothing will change.[A][N]
But all shall be under mine[N]
own power.[A][X]

##C26Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
We've word from our scouts.[A][N]
The Dalstian forces are closing in.[N]
It appears Lady Ciraweiss is in command.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ciraweiss? Arbordia's not taking the[N]
lead himself?[A] [...]No matter.[A][N]
What else did the scouts say?[A][X]

##C26Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
Positions, everyone.[N]
We've got an insurgent to squash.[A][N]
[...]You, there. Can you deliver[N]
these to our battle sages?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Tomes? Are our sages not[N]
already armed?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If this girl truly defeated Tarquin,[N]
we need more power.[A][N]
That's where these tomes come in.[N]
We tested them in Holanis.[A][N]
Absolutely effective on any manner[N]
of target,[A] with minimal ill[N]
repurcussions to the user.[A][N]
[...]Also, make sure that assassin we[N]
hired's getting in position.[A][N]
Not to doubt their abilities,[A][N]
but they spent an hour while I was[N]
hiring them showing off their sword.[A][N]
[...]I think they might be a bit[N]
unreliable, is all.[A][OpenMidLeft]
Very well, Lady Ethyl.[N]
It will be done.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Not that we'll need more[N]
at our disposal.[A][N]
Between Starfall and those[N]
simulacra Elcorian crafted[...][A][N]
Still. Contingencies are here[N]
for a reason.[A] Girard might[N]
not like Annihilation,[A][N]
but he's not the one leading[N]
the troops, now is he?[A][N]
What he sees as ignoble and[N]
unfair[...] I see as an edict.[A][N]
A rightful one for all who[N]
stand against Dalst.[A][X]

##C26Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]And that's all they reported.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Several Ciraweisses? Are[...] the[N]
simulacra advancing that quickly?[A][N]
And those tomes[...][A][N]
Now that I'm thinking about it,[N]
I feel[...] something dreadful.[A][N]
An animus magic beyond any I've[N]
ever felt before.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's our plan, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]All we can do is hold on[N]
as long as possible.[A][N]
They'll have to run out of[N]
men and supplies eventually.[A][N]
[...]But that could push us to[N]
our absolute limit, too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]If that's not feasible, I think[N]
I've got a simpler solution.[A][N]
We strike down Ciraweiss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's inelegant, but it might[N]
just work.[A] To be safe, I think[N]
we'd have to take down all of them.[A][N]
Her and her simulacra, I mean.[A][N]
Plus that dreadful presence, for[N]
good measure.[A] Whoever is powerful[N]
enough to control that magic[...][A][N]
They may command the respect needed[N]
to keep their forces together.[A][N]
But if all of them are out of[N]
the picture[...][A] That might[N]
just be our best plan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That all makes sense to me.[A][N]
[...]Time to rally the troops, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Today's the fight[N]
for all of our lives.[A][N]
We will never back down.[N]
And I know we shall triumph.[A][X]

##C26StarfallGet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]One last thing. We recovered[N]
this tome from Ciraweiss's body.[A][N]
It seems to be special. Do with[N]
it as you wish.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[...]Starfall. I[...] remember once reading[N]
one of her papers on it.[A][N]
Calling upon the purest might of[N]
the stars.[A] The fires of creation.[A][N]
It was[...] a pipe dream for[N]
the longest time.[A][N]
[...]Good for her, finishing what[N]
she started.[A][CloseEyes] [...]I don't know[N]
what was shed for this tome.[A][N]
But we'll use it to defy her.[A][N]
They will become the fires of[N]
our creation.[A][X]

##C26LastAnnihilatorMessage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
That dreadful magic I've been[N]
feeling this entire battle[...][A][N]
Coming from those sages.[A][N]
I think it's[...] fading.[N]
That might be the last of them.[A][N]
[...]We'd better take them out fast.[A][X]

##C26TurnsUpEthylAlive
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
How[...] How are they still[N]
alive? After all of this?[A][N]
[...]Forget this. I've thrown[N]
too much at this problem.[A][N]
If Girard wants her dead, he[N]
can do it himself for once.[A][X]

##C26TurnsUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
I think[...] it's over.[A][N]
We've lasted through the worst of[N]
what they have to throw at us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]Are they[...] retreating?[A][N]
[...]Let us reconvene, then.[N]
We still have much to prepare.[A][X]

##C26MapRouted
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
We've[...] pushed their forces back?[N]
That's incredible![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]

going, then.[A][N]
But first, we ought to reconvene.[A][X]

You're fighting for Lady Blair?[A][N]
[...]Well. This won't be easy for you.[N]
But I have something that might help.[A][N]
Funny story. Got in a real heated[N]
argument with a bud once.[A][N]
The man told me to go to hell.[N]
I[...] might've misinterpreted.[A][N]
And so I've been stuck with a book[N]
I couldn't use.[A] But, hey. It may[N]
help you win the day.[A][N]
Guess it'll have all been worth it.[A][X]

##C26Village2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
You need somethin' from me?[A][N]
Hm[...] Guess you can borrow my[N]
old walkin' stick for a few.[A][N]
[...]Wait. What am I doin'? I got[N]
this fancy staff right 'ere![A][N]
[...]I'm gettin' on in years,[A][N]
but you'd think I could tell my[N]
walkin' stick from a magical rod.[A][N]
Good thing I noticed quick, at[N]
the very least.[A] This thing[N]
looks mighty fragile.[A][N]
Surely couldn't handle my[N]
weight all day.[A][X]

##C26Village3Text

Used to be a real accomplished[N]
lumberjack back in my prime.[A][N]
Still got myself an axe for every[N]

Those days are behind me, though.[N]
You can take the jewel of my collection.[A][N]
It's never even been used. Always felt[N]
using it on a tree would be overkill.[A][X]

##C26Village4Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie3]
Check this out, bud.[A][N]
Snagged it from an arena.[N]
One of their bloodsport books.[A][N]
Can you feel the sheer power[N]
radiating from it?[A][N]
This[...] This is not something[N]
normal people can get.[A][N]
I've got a few more in storage.[N]
You can give this one a spin.[A][N]
Just mind yourself. It's not[N]
exactly[...] reliable.[A][X]

You're so cool and brave[...][A][N]

a look at my cool drawing![A][N]
It's a sword![A][N]
[...]You can take it with you[N]
if you want![A] I can always[N]
draw another sword.[A][X]

##C26Village7Text

Sorry to bother you, but can[N]
you take this off my hands?[A][N]
This ring's just been giving me[N]
bad feelings ever since I found it.[A][N]
Like it's compelling me to be more[N]
efficient with my time[...][A][N]
I don't need a lecture from a[N]
piece of jewelry of all things.[A][X]

##C26House1Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier1]
Lady Ethyl seems to be taking the[N]
field today.[A] I can't say if she's[N]
ever taken it before,[A] but I'd[N]
think the army can function without her.[A][N]
Taking her out early would certainly[N]
help our defense,[A] but would by no[N]
means halt the enemy.[A][N]
[...]Then again, maybe if you take[N]
out her AND her doubles[...][A][N]
[...]And maybe for good measure,[N]
their Annihilation users[...][A][N]
That'd be enough to demoralize them?[N]
Might be worth a shot.[A][X]

##C26House2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier5]
I've got a status report on our[N]
enemy's weaponry.[A][N]
Their sages are using a tome that[N]
they call Annihilation.[A][N]
If they're allowed to strike with it,[N]
it will certainly kill its target.[A][N]
However, that sheer power is also[N]
its main weakness;[A] Annihilation is[N]
overwhelming to its user,[A][N]
and so even the act of arming oneself[N]
with it will render the user mute.[A][N]
The way I see it, if you want to[N]
live through this battle,[A][N]
you'll have to target those sages[N]
before their magic returns,[A][N]
lest Annihilation[...] annihilate.[A][X]


##C26AnnihilatorExplanation
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Interesting[...][A][N]
Annihilation's still unstable enough[N]
to wreak such havok on its users.[A][N]
I suppose our sages will need a moment[N]
to adjust to the tome's power.[A][N]
No matter. Once that moment passes,[N]
none shall survive our assault.[A][N]
Between Annihilation and our simulacra[...][N]
The traitor shall kneel before us.[A][X]

Crimes? You're quite[N]
presumptuous, child.[A][N]
And whether or not our[N]
actions are moral,[A][N]
I won't let you end[N]
these thirteen years.[A][N]
Begone, and let Dalst's[N]
glorious future take hold![A][X]

##C26EthylZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Prince of Elba Cor.[N]
You stand against Dalst.[A][N]
I won't hesitate to reduce[N]
you to nothingness.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
And I won't hesitate to fight[N]
for what I know is right.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Throw away your life, then.[N]
Make a martyr of yourself.[A][N]
You won't have meant a thing.[A][X]

##C26EthylArinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]The Valkyrie.[A] You went missing[N]
right as I joined Jraeyan.[A][N]
Always stung a bit. Not being[N]
a part of such a project.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Is that all anyone is[N]
to you? A curiosity?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You're far more than a[N]
curiosity, Valkyrie.[A][N]
You're an ideal. A legend.[N]
[...]A threat to me.[A][N]
And so, you must fall.[A][X]

##C26EthylKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The prodigal son returns.[A][N]
How's the blood on your hands[N]
feel? It's never coming off.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
That's quite rich, coming[N]
from someone like you.[A][N]
You, Girard, my father[...][A][N]
You're all stains upon the[N]
nation of Dalst.[A][N]
And if it takes killing all[N]
of you to remedy its sins,[A][N]
so be it.[A][N]
Now, then. I believe it is[N]
time for you to die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Insolent.[A][N]
We aim to build something[N]
truly grand,[A] and you wish[N]
to burn it all to the ground.[A][N]
That is a sin most unforgivable.[N]
And now, you will die.[A][X]

##C26EthylDesmondBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
Lady of Ciraweiss![A][N]
You have brought tremendous[N]
sorrow to Aercolyn![A][N]
On my honor as the commander[N]
of Aercolyn's finest,[A][N]
I will strike you down![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The finest among you is not[N]
a fraction of our worst man.[A][N]
I shall end you, and let[N]
those who remain surrender.[A][N]
Everybody you knew will die[N]
to sate our curiosity.[A][N]
And you will be the first[N]
to die.[A] Farewell.[A][X]

##C26EthylEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Elcorian's told me much[N]
about you, Emile.[A][N]
Shame for you that you haven't[N]
returned to his side.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][CloseEyes]
I[...] truly wish it is not[N]
too late for him.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But I will stand for what[N]
I know to be just and right.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The only person it's too[N]
late for is you.[A][N]
He might not like it, but[N]
I'll just say it's a cost.[A][N]
A cost of changing the world.[A][X]

##C26EthylJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Know your damned place,[N]
subject.[A] Don't think you[N]
mean anything now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
[...]I[...] I will kill you.[A][N]
For all you have brought[N]
upon us.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
No. I will kill you.[A][N]
And you will become our[N]
next masterpiece.[A][X]

##C26EthylPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You had everything you[N]
needed, guard.[A][N]
And you squandered it for[N]
nobody insurgents.[A][N]
Really, you only have yourself[N]
to blame for what's happening.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
You're wrong.[A][N]
You[...] You hurt my friends.[A][N]
It's only right for me[N]
to fight for them.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Then die in the name of[N]
your vengeance.[A][N]
Just know that it's[N]
all your fault.[A][X]

##C26EthylHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Horatio. I remember you[N]
quite vividly.[A][N]
Shame you're still alive.[N]
I can fix that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
Nay. I shall be the one[N]
to remedy my errors.[A][N]
I shall end your life.[N]
Scatter it about the winds.[A][N]
Bards will sing glorious[N]
ballads of my triumph![A][N]
And perhaps the darkness[N]
to which I am host[...][A][N]
Perhaps it will be satiated.[A][N]
And if not, I can tear down[N]
everything you stood for.[A][N]
How does that sound?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]I like the sound of me[N]
killing you better.[A][X]

##C26EthylSimoneBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Good to see you well, Ethyl.[A][N]
But I'm not here to talk[N]
small, as you can guess.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You were truly one of our[N]
finest, Simone.[A][N]
What does this betrayal stand[N]
to leave you with?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCiraweiss]
I think you've long[N]
misinterpreted me.[A][N]
Everything I've ever done[N]
was for my own sake.[A][N]
Once, sticking around with[N]
Jraeyan was what I needed.[A][N]
Now, it isn't.[A][N]
What more do you want me[N]
to say?[A] Yesterday's done.[N]
Today's what's happening.[A][N]
And today, you're in my way.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]Well, then. These years[N]
meant nothing to you.[A][N]
And so, they mean nothing[N]
to me.[A] [...]Die, Georgios.[A][X]

##C26EthylElizaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Begone, child.[A][N]
This field's no place[N]
for someone like you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEliza]
You're[...] You're wrong.[A][N]
You're the lady of my state,[N]
and yet[...][A] You've done[N]
so many awful things.[A][N]
I[...] I can't back down.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
The child wishes to tarnish[N]
the Ciraweiss name?[A][N]
Well, then. I'll make this[N]
fun. Farewell, child.[A][X]

##C26EthylDirkBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadDirk]
[...]Lady Ciraweiss.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
I suppose you know me.[A][N]
Well, I don't know you.[A][N]
You are nothing but an[N]
obstacle in my path.[A][N]
Now, then. Burn.[A][X]

##C26EthylClarqueBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadClarque]
[...]I saw you. At Jraeyan.[A][N]
You're the one who was[N]
behind the slaughter.[A][N]
I was[...] too weak. Too scared.[N]
Too pathetic to stop it.[A][N]
But I won't falter now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You cared for those mercs?[A][N]
Shame, I guess. They were[N]
a necessary sacrifice.[A][N]
[...]And it wasn't my idea.[A][N]
But I'm sure you don't care[N]
about those specifics.[A][N]
If you want to kill me, try.[N]
You'll fail.[A] But maybe it'll[N]
make you feel better.[A][X]

##C26EthylOlsenBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss][CloseEyes]
[...]For the love of[...][A][N]
Why'd I pick the worst[N]
assassin on the continent?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOlsen]
I take offense to that.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
I'll demonstrate my skills[N]
firsthand, if you'd wish![A][N][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
[...]No matter. I hardly needed[N]
you anyway.[A] You were simply[N]
a failsafe.[A] And now you're[N]
target practice.[A][X]

##C26EthylSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Surveil? Here?[A][N]
[...]Almost gets me nostalgic.[A][N]
Best thing to come out of[N]
Jraeyan, honestly.[A][N]
Shame I'll have to put it[N]
down like this,[A] but maybe[N]
this is the excuse I need.[A][N]
Take it apart, study it,[N]
build it again better.[A][N]
[...]I like the sound of that.[A][X]

##C26EthylDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Power[...][N]
Too[...] much power[...][A][N]
How in the hell[...][N]
have you gotten[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
No[...] matter[...][A][N]
This will never[...] end[...][A][N]
He will[...] never[...][N]
let[...] it[...] end[...][A][X]

##C26EthylKillsBlair
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I[...] Everyone[...][N]
I'm[...] sorry[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
You could've stood alongside[N]
us.[A] But it's too late for[N]
what-ifs now.[A][N]
Farewell, Aercolyn.[A][X]

##C26EthylKillsZeke
[OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
I[...] know that[...][N]
I wasn't wrong[...][A][N][CloseEyes][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadCiraweiss]
Tell yourself that.[N]
But look at who's alive.[A][N]
And look at who shall die[N]
in the name of our world.[A][X]

##Ch26_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungEthyl]
Should I be concerned for you?[A][N]
Don't think your absences have[N]
gone unnoticed, Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Jraeyan's been under our control[N]
for[...] What, three years now?[A][N]
And has anything substantial[N]
come of it?[A] One iota that[N]
justifies their crimes?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not as of yet.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I know you put a lot on the line[N]
with them.[A] But I think it's[N]
better we cut our losses.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look at the bigger picture.[A][N]
We let them go free, they find[N]
themselves another stronghold,[A][N]
and they're back to doing what[N]
they did with Sinclair.[A][N]
I am[...] Dalst is keeping them[N]
in check.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is this truly simpler than just[N]
killing them and being done with it?[A][N]
It's harsh, but it would be over[N]
and done with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] want to believe that their[N]
knowledge can better Ulmaron.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Guess that's what separates us.[N]
You will never let this end.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[...]I understand where you're coming[N]
from.[A] You've put far too much into[N]
this place. Met some smart people.[A][N]
You don't want to lose that.[A][N]
So you keep digging yourself[N]
deeper.[A] [...]And I can't say[N]
I don't get it.[A][N]
I wouldn't want to admit I've wasted[N]
three years of my life either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd hardly say it was wasted.[A][N]
Just that[...] our goals are[N]
long-term.[A][N]
[...]I do truly need your assistance.[A][N]
You've one of the finest[N]
minds around.[A][N]
And you're the only other in[N]
Dalst who knows of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Damn it. Fine.[A][N]
[...]Wait, you still haven't[N]
told Elcorian of this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] hasn't come up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've never a thought you haven't[N]
immediately told him.[A][N]
[...]Are you trying to protect him[N]
from this? From you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] In fact, maybe[N]
it IS about time he knew.[A][N]
But enough of that. Let you[N]
and I return to what we know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Of course, old friend.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] know this hasn't all[N]
been a waste.[A][N]
All our understanding is to[N]
create a glorious future.[A][X]

##C26JonasJoin
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJonas]
Hold your fire.[A][N]
I am Jonas, of Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You[...] I think I recognize[N]
you.[A] [...]Lazarus attacking us[N]
at sea. You were there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That I was. Would've probably[N]
died then and there,[A][N]
had you not gotten him out of[N]
the picture so I could leave.[A][N]
I've[...] heard of your group's[N]
exploits since then.[A][N]
And you've left quite the[N]
bloody trail since.[A][N]
I know[...] you're the ones who[N]
killed Amara. And Valden.[A][N]
Not to mention the emperor.[A][N]
[...]But you also brought an end[N]
to the man oppressing our land.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Both of our countries have made[N]
many mistakes these past few months.[A][N]
And I can tell you've been trying[N]
to fix them.[A] That counts for[N]
more than you know.[A][N]
And I know that the world will[N]
not know peace until this ends.[A][N]
So, if you will have me, I will[N]
fight to end these needless wars.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] would appreciate that.[A][N][CloseEyes]
And I'm truly sorry for the[N]
role I've played in all of this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Again, you're trying. Just[N]
think towards tomorrow.[A][N]
We can leave the past where[N]
it is.[A] Guiding us, but not[N]
taking away from us.[A][X]
