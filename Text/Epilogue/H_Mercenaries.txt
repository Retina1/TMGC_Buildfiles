Once more unto this life,[N]
old friend.[A] Have you[N]
finally grown weary?[A][N][OpenRight]
I've been weary for ages.[A][N]
But I can't show it around[N]
you. [...]Wait. Crap.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm the one guy alive who[N]
can make you aspire.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]I like that feeling.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm sure you do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You two're resuming your[N]
mercenary ways, then?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yup. Guess you can call on[N]
what's left of our group.[A][N]
Between the debts and Manfred[N]
here, I'm in no rush to settle.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I've got to keep Wilhelm[N]
here alive.[A] It's not easy.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hey, I try.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Then do please try harder.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]For you, anything.[A][X]

You sure you're up for this life?[N]
It's a hell of a time.[A][N]
I speak from[...] lots of experience.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll be more than fine. Worst case,[N]
I'm the one on the pegasus.[A][N]
Running's easy.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]Don't worry.[N]
I'd make sure to grab you.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm truly glad we're at the point in our[N]
relationship where I'm not left for dead.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Perhaps I'd make you beg for it.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Ah.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You two look like you've got[N]
your plans figured out.[A][N]{OpenRight]
Less a plan, milady, and more just[...][N]
Winging it. As I always have.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You got me by winging it.[A][N]
How hard can the rest of[N]
your life truly be?[A][N][OpenRight]
Suppose there's only one[N]
way to find that out.[A][N]
[...]Godspeed, milady.[A][X]
