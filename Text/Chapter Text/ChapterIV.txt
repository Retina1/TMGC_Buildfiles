[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've come quite a way. I'd[N]
say we make camp for the night.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I must say, this[N]
is quite[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unexpected.[A][N]
I figured most of Holanis would[N]
resemble the Lowlands[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But this is quite the[N]
remarkable landscape.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Looking at my map, I can't[N]
fully say what country we're in.[A][N]
Guess this is fairly remote.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yet there's still signs of life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
From what I've heard, eastern[N]
Holanian settlers are a rare,[A][N]
yet resilient thing.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel your family would[N]
be right at home here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure they would be.[A][X]

##V4_Opening4
[OpenLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
What in the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Who'd[N]
strike us here?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadDean]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I recognize those colors.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're Holanians.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Why would-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can ponder that later. We[N]
need to fend them off first.[A][N]
I don't think we'll be safe[N]
until we've dealt with all of them.[A][N]
And if they're recklessly attacking[N]
us,[A] they might threaten those nearby[N]
settlers in the process.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. We need to[N]
be swift and decisive.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I appreciate the plannin',[N]
but I'd move quickly.[A][N]
The sun's goin' down, and if[N]
we don't fend 'em off fast,[N]
we'll be in for more than[N]
we could handle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone! Today, we fight[N]
for our survival![A][N]
Time is of the essence,[N]
but I know we can prevail![A][X]

##V4_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I still so[N]
shaken over this?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's like he says. It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
good to feel this way.[A][N]
I know I'm still human.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
Pardon me, Viridian. A messenger[N]
wishes to speak with us.[A][N]
She appears to bear the Elba[N]
Corian banner.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Elba Cor? What do they[N]
want with us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've no idea.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, if she was able[N]
to track us down[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
She's probably worth talking to.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadMessenger]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]Blue haired girl from Couria -[N]
seeking assistance in Holanis.[A][N]
Proposal to sortie at Fort[N]
Jraeyan -[A] negotiate with[N]
messenger and send her back to us.[A][N]
We'll accept any price.[N]
Thank you.[CloseQuote][A][N]
That is what she wrote.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I believe I remember her.[A][N][OpenLeft]
As do I. Thank you.[A][N]
Might we discuss this before[N]
sending you with an answer?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. I shall be outside.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Guess our advertising[N]
finally paid off.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's enthusiatic.[A][N]
Were you not concerned about once[N]
again working for nobility, though?[A][N]
The way she carried herself,[A][N]
and now suddenly having these[N]
sorts of connections[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
She's clearly not an ordinary[N]
client by any means.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
True[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Plus, Fort Jraeyan's supposed to be[N]
in an abandoned part of Holanis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Why WOULD she hire a mercenary group[N]
when she's made it far south alone?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps she expects resistance.[N]
Perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Those attacks as we left Couria.[N]
Might they have something to do with this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So if we agree to this, we're[N]
knee deep in some conspiracy.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Again.[A][N]
But if we do nothing, who[N]
knows what may happen?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How do you mean? If we don't go,[N]
then she doesn't visit an old fort.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon me.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
Excuse me! Messenger! By chance,[N]
do you have any more details?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They didn't tell me much,[A][N]
but I overheard mumblings of[N]
artificial dragons in Holanis.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
changes things.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's many factors at play here.[A][N]
If nothing else, I think we need[N]
to confirm what's going on.[A][N]
If it's far too dangerous, we'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
pull out.[A] And convince her to[N]
get out of this, too.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps this is beyond us.[A][N]
But it's also beyond the thousands[N]
of lives a crisis could endanger.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm behind you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. I'll confirm with the[N]
others, and then we're southbound.[A][X]
