##C16VillageText1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Heya! I'm tryin' to read this book,[N]
but the words are all confusing![A][N]
What's it mean to sleep with open eyes?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't get it.[A][N]
Plus, when I read this line here,[N]
I think I walked through this table[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You know what? Do you want this book?[N]
I think you'll like it.[A][X]

##C16VillageText2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
There's a battle outside?[N]
Huh. Well, then.[A][N]
Never thought living next to a[N]
library would endanger my life.[A][N]
I guess you deserve thanks. I nicked[N]
this here staff a few weeks back.[A][N]
It'll make anything good as new.[N]
Except flesh, I guess.[A][N]
That's funny, you know. Staves[N]
either fix people,[A][N]
or everything besides people.[A][X]

##C16VillageText3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
I've heard the prince is back.[N]
That's truly something.[A][N]
I mean, it was unfortunate to hear[N]
he had died, but, like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I don't know, I guess it didn't[N]
really hurt that much.[A][N]
Never knew him or the royals[N]
in general.[A][N]
All I can afford to think about[N]
is my own day-to-day survival.[A][N]
Speaking of, if you want to survive,[N]
you might find this helpful.[A][X]

##Ch16_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNeillstrom][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
What's the matter, Tarquin?[N]
You look[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] severe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Apologies. Those damned invaders[N]
gave my men the slip.[A][N]
Guess however they were able to warp in,[N]
they warped out just as easily.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's quite unfortunate. Do there appear[N]
to be other locations under attack?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm not quite sure, but I didn't see[N]
anything of value.[A][N]
I'll scout again, but if nothing's worth[N]
noting, I'm reporting to Dalst.[A][N]
You know how Lord Arbordia is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Thank you for your assistance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Who[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is behind this?[N]
He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He must know the answers.[A][X]

##Ch16_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We've lost our lead.[A][N]
We could blindly chase them,[N]
but that's quite the risk.[A][N]
Unfortunately, information on Holanis[N]
is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sparse.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I've got an idea.[A][N]
Do you know of the Elba Cor Archives?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The what?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's something most nobility's heard of.[A][N]
A library dedicated to chronicling the[N]
continent's history.[A][N]
We might be able to find information[N]
on Holanis there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's about as good[N]
an idea as any.[A][N]
I presume if you bring it up,[N]
it's in the capital somewhere?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Technically, it's just outside Couria,[N]
but it's close enough.[A][N]
Shall we depart then?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Lead the way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How could I not know of something as[N]
simple yet important as this?[A][N]
What else about my home am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
am I blind to?[A][X]

##Ch16_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
What's going on here?[N]
Why is it on fire?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This destruction isn't from[N]
any normal bandits[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Did Holanis have the same idea as us?[A][N]
Only, they'd wish to halt our progress[N]
by hiding the truth?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
In any case, it's not too late yet.[A][N]
If we can clear them out quick enough,[N]
I'm sure we'll find some surviving records.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Everyone, prepare[N]
to face Holanis again.[A][N]
We've got no time for doubt![A][X]

##Ch16_Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadZeke]
That's the last of them.[N]
Is everyone alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Would you two happen[N]
to be the saviors?[A][N]
What, pray tell, are you[N]
looking for?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Does there happen to be anything[N]
on Holanis?[A] Perhaps its geography,[N]
or historical landmarks?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Give me a moment.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
So we'll use this to map out[N]
a route?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's the plan. I don't know[N]
much of western Holanis.[A][N]
And the east half of the country[N]
was barren enough for hiding me,[A][N]
so I doubt there'd be much of[N]
worth.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Here you go. Took some searching,[N]
but luckily they're in good shape.[A][N]
This here's an atlas dating back to[N]
the old Holanian kingdom[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've got a modern journal recounting[N]
expeditions and new settlements[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Nothing much about the fall itself,[N]
but that's just how it is.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Thank you, sir. We'll just copy down[N]
some notes and be on our way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. Take what you need with you.[N]
Least I could do for you saving me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Even better. Thank you![A][N]
If there's nothing else,[N]
we may as well be off.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Certainly. Good day, sir.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_Best
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Wait! Before you go, I wanted[N]
to thank you. Really.[A][N]
You saved some priceless literature[N]
today. You deserve something nice.[A][N]
Take this. I insist.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's this[N]
sheet of paper here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What sheet? I didn't grab any loose paper.[N]
I'm sure it's just part of a book.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, thank you.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_Good
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Wait! Before you go, I wanted[N]
to thank you. Really.[A][N]
Though you didn't save every book,[N]
you did about as well as you could.[A][N]
Take this. I insist.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, thank you.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_Eh
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Wait! Before you go, I felt[N]
I should thank you again.[A][N]
Though we lost some vital records,[N]
you still saved a lot of literature.[A][N]
Take this for your trouble.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_Bad
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
Wait! Before you go, I felt[N]
you deserved some thanks.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] saddened, at what was lost.[N]
But at least you saved some books.[A][N]
You deserve at least a little something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_YouTried
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You tried back there.[N]
Take this for your trouble.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Those were nice books. They[N]
really and truly were.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll be going now.[N]
Thank you.[A][X]

##Ch16_Reward_HowDidYouDoThisBad
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight]
Fwoosh![A][N][OpenLeft]
Plink![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ow! Did[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] someone throw[N]
a coin at me?[A][N]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] May as well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArchivist]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good for nothing. Those brutes destroyed[N]
all my favorite cookbooks![A][N]
And you stood aside and WATCHED![N]
For shame, young lady! FOR SHAME![A][X]

##_Ch16SysText
Over time, books will emerge[N]
from the shelves,[A] and enemies[N]
will move to attack them.[A][N]
Books being destroyed will[N]
not cause a game over.[A][N]
You will get rewarded based[N]
on how many books survive,[A][N]
with the best rewards given for[N]
letting two or fewer books fall.[A][N]
If the turn limit expires,[N]
it's game over.[A][X]

##C16NicoleBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
What a strange job. Least[N]
they're payin' me well.[A][N]
And I get to cut through some[N]
goons like you. That's fun.[A][X]

##C16NicoleArtemisBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Well, well, well. What're[N]
you doin' on their side?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
It's clear to me. This is[N]
a meaningless fight.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Perhaps from your point of view.[N]
But me? This is my big break.[A][N]
I finish this job, and Holanis'll[N]
pay a king's ransom.[A][N]
It's a shame to have to kill you.[N]
Truly. I liked you.[A][N]
But, hey. At least it'll be easy.[A][X]

##C16NicoleDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNicole]
Damn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I underestimated[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
was for naught[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
