##C18_Secret_Seller
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJake]
Howdy, lassie![N]
I'm back![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you are. Is there[N]
another secret shop?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's right! My girlie's[N]
just the greatest.[A][N]
I could never run the gig[N]
she's able to.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, it's almost[N]
inconceivable.[A][N]
One woman, simultaneously[N]
running hundreds of shops.[A][N]
But you're not here to[N]
question her reality-bending.[A][N]
You're here for a patented[N]
shop hint![A][N]
For this one, you'll need to[N]
have some bright ideas.[A][N]
Perhaps take a breather if[N]
things get too tents-[A][N]
er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] tense.[A][N]
Perhaps reflect on a mage's[N]
lonely isle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's even worse[N]
than the last hint.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look, Anna likes a good mystery.[N]
Even at the cost of business.[A][N]
Anyhoot, see ya soon![A][X]

##C18_Alexis_Artemis_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArtemis][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis][OpenMidLeft]
And who would you be?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Alexis, ma'am! Pride of[N]
Elba Cor. I hope.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see. 'Twas just curious what[N]
someone so young was doing here.[A][N]
But you seem to serve with pride.[N]
I was a knight around your age, too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're from Holanis, right?[N]
Who[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do you even serve?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
While it's not too influential yet, there's[N]
some power concentrating in Gohranos.[A][N]
A result of generations of people who[N]
believe that there's potential.[A][N]
Potential for the rebirth of Holanis.[A][N]
Of course, given the country's size,[A][N]
and the number of existent settlements[N]
with no interest in becoming a state,[A][N]
it's an uphill battle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And what brought you against us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Orders from the Gohranian senate.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] blindly loyal.[N]
And I hope I'll find some explanation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, if you can't return, Elba Cor[N]
could always use some more knights![A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
I'll keep that in mind.[A][X]

##C18_Sam_Bechamel_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadBechamel]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's pretty, in a way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ye. A testament to life. If scum[N]
like us can cling ta this barren land,[A][N]
anything's possible. Makes ya think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

You're a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] kind man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

The past be a cruel thing.[A][N]
But, aye. That be what the[N]

##C18_Butch_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Evening, Butch. How's the family?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, for real. I'm genuinely[N]
curious about your family.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm not quite sure that helps.[A][N]
But, alright. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They exist.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Should've expected that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I never really settled down.[A][N]
I've been with a few[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] people,[N]
but nothing ever really lasted.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. What about siblings?[N]
Or your parents?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've got a brother. Runs some restaurant[N]
in the capital.[A] Something to do[N]
with a misplaced sword.[A][N]
As for my parents, they're somehow[N]
still kicking. Don't write them much.[A][N]
Maybe I should. What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's funny. I've got a cousin that[N]
runs a restaurant myself.[A][N]
Alas, I'm an only son. As for[N]
parents, they live in Couria.[A][N]
Managed to stop by and catch up[N]
before this Holanis thing started.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe once this is done, I'll give[N]
your brother's place a try.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh. Wouldn't mind trying some Elba Cor[N]
food myself.[A] Assuming your cousin[N]
has a friends and family discount.[A][X]

##C18_Avan_Toddsworth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAvan][OpenMidRight][LoadToddsworth]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heya, Avan. Wanna hear[N]
me rant for a bit?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not particularly. But I suppose[N]
I can humor you, Todd.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sworth. Anyway, can you believe it?[A][N]
Not one person in this army has[N]
thrown themselves at my feet.[A][N]
I'm a hero now! A big shot![N]
I restored the prince![A][N]
So why won't anyone give[N]
old Toddsworth the time of day?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just look up. It's dark.[N]
I'd say evening.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very funny.[A][N]
I'm just sayin', why am I sticking[N]
around if I'm not getting action?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have you actually talked to[N]
anyone in this army?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's their job. I'm a catch.[N]
They're supposed to chase me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look, I'm just saying.[N]
If you want [OpenQuote]some,[CloseQuote][A] you need to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, put in effort.[A][N]
Get to know people.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nope. Too hard. I'll just stare blankly at[N]
the first woman with an axe I see.[A][N]
The blank stare's my best move.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. He's about to[N]
lose an eye or two.[A][X]

##C18_Blair_Emile_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You seem deep in thought.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Ah, Blair. I was just thinking.[A][N]
As far as I remember, Elcorian once[N]
mentioned doing research in Holanis.[A][N]
I wonder if perhaps he'll turn up[N]
again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That'd be quite the coincidence.[A][N]
Though I'm sure there's a lot to[N]
learn from there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For a kingdom rumored to have been[N]
so influential,[A] to be wiped[N]
off the map and out of history[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unusual, to say the least.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, you'll get to see it firsthand.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
That's exciting, is it not?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll admit I'm quite curious.[A][N]
Of course, I hardly need the lure of[N]
knowledge to stand by your side.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll call it extra incentive.[A][N]
Thanks again for sticking this[N]
out for so long, Emile.[A][X]

##C18_Desmond_Flynn_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond][OpenMidRight][LoadFlynn]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Flynn! What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah! My bad. Lost in thought.[N]
I had just wanted to ask[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Would you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be interested in[N]
me teaching you some swordplay?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, what's this about?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] skilled. And we share[N]
a passion for technique.[A][N]
I thought maybe I could learn[N]
from teaching someone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Makes sense to me. In that case,[N]
I'd be delighted to learn.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Another tool in the belt[N]
would certainly be valuable.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, Desmond.[N]
We'll start after this battle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I look forward to learning.[A][X]

##C18_Hyperius_Leila_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Go away.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm surprised you're still here.[N]
Everyone is, frankly.[A][N]
There's no point in seething.[N]
If you wish to leave, do it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's stopping you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You were a great soldier.[N]
Truly.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Shut up, old man.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
So embittered and hateful[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What happened to her?[A][X]
