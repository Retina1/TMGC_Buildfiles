I've been here several years now.[N]
It's not always been easy.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But Holanis will rise once again.[N]
We're a resilient people.[A][N]
Gohranos won't suffer the same fate[N]
as the ghosts of Holanis past.[A][N]
And one day, we'll rise to the[N]
heights of its prior glory.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As for now, we're quite small.[N]
But that means nothing.[A][X]

Wha-[A][N]
Who's there?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just a girl?[N]
Coming in unannounced?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies. Surprised me there.[A][N]
To think even in the most[N]
remote of places[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
People just barge on in.[A][N]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] look like you're not from here.[A][N]
How funny. Neither am I.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can see that look. You're[N]
wondering who I am.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a man unshackled by[N]
his past. That's what.[A][N]
That's the beauty of this place.[A][N]
Nobody needs to know where you're[N]
from. Nobody cares.[A][N]
Great place for starting over.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. You seem[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
busy. I won't bother.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Scared her off. And before[N]
she realized. Good.[A][N]
With my luck, that bastard[N]
sent her to find me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I still wasn't wrong.[N]
I will never be, Girard.[A][X]

##I9Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now that we're here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
it's smaller than I thought.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps we shouldn't draw[N]
too much attention to ourselves.[A][N]
I'd hate to imagine something happening[N]
to this place because of us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You think Dalst would attack this[N]
place for helping us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't know. But I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't[N]
think it'd be beyond them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We can set camp nearby.[N]
I'll enter alone and shop.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think it'd be for the best.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait outside, please.[A][N]
I'll report back to you once[N]
I've finished up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. Just be careful.[A][X]

##I9HandleAsk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
Ah, greetings. I'm a blacksmith.[N]
Anything you'd like to reforge?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Any legendary weapons? I'm quite[N]
studied on those.[A][N]
If you've got anything you[N]
wanna hand over,[A] I'd love[N]
to give it a gander.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##I9ReforgeArkhinal
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Actually, I have this handle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] an axe handle.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N]
Gods[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is part of[N]
the Arkhinal![A][N]
I could[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] reforge a legendary[N]
weapon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's my dream![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is all I have, though.[N]
No big heavy blade part.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So I don't think you'll[N]
be able to do much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's the[N]
Arkhinal's secret.[A][N]
But to understand, you'll need[N]
to learn about the legend.[A][N]
The man who forged this, and[N]
all our land's finest weapons.[A][N]
He truly believed that the power[N]
of a weapon was meaningless,[A][N]
compared to the power of whoever[N]
held that weapon.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Any weapon could become a legend.[N]
And legends could come from anywhere.[A][N]
To reflect that belief, he crafted[N]
all the weapons in unusual ways.[A][N]
The Arkhinal, for example, is little[N]
more than a magically attuned handle.[A][N]
It amplifies the power of whatever[N]
axe head you attach to it.[A][N][MoveMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Like so. This common iron axe head[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
now holds the strength to fell armies.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No. Thank you. It's always been[N]
a dream to behold such power.[A][X]

##I9Refusal
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan4][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I'm good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you do have artifacts.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. That's a shame.[A][N]
But I get it. I'm a stranger.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good day, young lady.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't believe so.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alas. It's what it is.[A][N]
Well, then. If you've nothing[N]
else, you need not stay.[A][X]

##I9MerchantTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6]
Heya, lass. I've got a truly[N]
legendary treasure for you.[A][N]
It's only 19998 gold. That sounds[N]
like a lot, but it's truly nothing.[A][N]
It's truly beyond compare.[N]
It's truly beyond compare.[A][N]
It's truly beyond compare.[A][X]

##I9NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait. You smell like you[N]
can't afford it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn. So close.[A][X]

##I9TreasurePurchased
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. Here you go![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Huh. That worked.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sucker.[A][X]

##I9TreasureDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I'm good.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Cheapskate.[A][X]

##I9HandlePrompt

Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Irrecoverable Estoc,[CloseQuote] Gohranos's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You look a little bit like you've[N]
heard all of this before.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't care. Please. Eat here.[N]
We need your business.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know what it's like running[N]
a shop like this?[A][N]
In the middle of nowhere?[N]
Not very fun, young lady.[A][X]

Ah, hello there! Welcome to[N]
our little establishment.[A][N]
We're the [OpenQuote]Irrecoverable Estoc,[CloseQuote] Gohranos's[N]
finest bar and inn.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Come on in. We've got a seat[N]
right near another traveler.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadTonnamin][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Can't say I've seen you here before.[A][N]
Then again, haven't seen a lot[N]
of people before.[A] World's a[N]
big ol' place, after all.[A][N]
The name's Tonnamin.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You look like you could use[N]
a bit o' extra muscle.[A][N]
Am I wrong?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry. Comin' on a bit strong.[A][N]
Gotta take things leisurely.[N]
That's what my brother says.[A][N]
Well, one of them, anyway.[A][N]
Hard to remember who says what[N]
when there's eight of us total.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies for rambling.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's alright. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wouldn't[N]
mind the extra manpower.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Consider it done, then. Call it[N]
a good deed.[A] I can respect someone[N]
who makes time to talk to people.[A][N]
Take in the sights, explore the world.[N]
All that jazz.[A] Life's too great[N]
to rush through,[A] and I can tell[N]
that you get that.[A][N]
So, I'll help ya' keep livin' it.[A][X]
