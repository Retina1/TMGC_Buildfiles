[...]Hello, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Johan! How[...] How are[N]
you doing?[A] Do you[N]
need anything of me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing in particular.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! Do you wish[N]
to make conversation?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm alright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A][N]
[...]Well, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I am[...] so very tired.[A][N]
[...]Can anything truly go[N]
back to normal now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I admit, things are[...][N]
not great.[A][N][CloseEyes]
And[...] I haven't experienced[N]
the true worst of it.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But[...] I still don't want to[N]
give up hope.[A][N]
I've survived many things.[N]
You've survived many things.[A][N]
I'm[...] sure we'll stand up to[N]
whatever comes our way.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] don't want to[...][A][N]
Nobody deserves to[...][N]
suffer like we have[...][A][N]
I'm sorry[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] should be sorry.[N]
I could've[...] stopped this all.[A][N]
If only I[...] were stronger[...][N]
Faster[...][A] If only I were[...][N]
a true knight[...][A][X]

##C24_Sam_Charley_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
You've been learning so fast.[N]
I'm almost a little jealous.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sorry[...] Sorry![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Don't be.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Still hard to believe that this[N]
war's your first time using a bow.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]My father and brother are both[N]
archers.[A] I[...] had never been interested[N]
in the bow before.[A][N]
But I'd still watch them practice.[A][N]
And when I[...] decided to join[N]
the army[...][A] They had asked[N]
if I had any experience.[A][N]
I panicked and said bows.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Now that you mention it, I think[N]
I once shot against a Barford.[A][N]
Trounced him, in fact.[A][N]
Pretty sure his name was[...] Robert?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah! Bobert! That's him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Bobert? That's[...][N]
a name, alright.[A][N]
But do go on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He's always been really skilled.[N]
At everything.[A][N]
He's in line to inherit the house's name.[N]
[...]And then there's the rest of us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
On the bright side, no inheritance[N]
means nothing tying you down.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
You could always keep traveling[N]
alongside me.[A][N]
I enjoy the company.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] do too.[A][X]

##C24_Butch_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
You holdin' up, Cassius?[N]
It's been a long journey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Should ask you that, Butch.[N]
You're twice my age.[A][N]
I've got youthful spirit[N]
to carry me through.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You callin' me old?[A][N]
[...]I mean, guess I'm not[N]
gettin' any younger.[A][N]
But neither are you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The passage of time truly[N]
does undress us all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Right.[A][N]
[...]You know, I had wanted to[N]
step back onto the battlefield.[A][N]
Feel some kind of spark again.[A][N]
[...]Is it wrong to feel content[N]
now?[A] To be fine with hanging[N]
up my sword forever after this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd hardly think so.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's just that I've lived by[N]
the sword for so many years.[A][N]
Can I really just stop?[N]
Or will it call me again?[N]
Am I fated to die fighting?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hell if I know.[A][N]
I don't want to waste my life[N]
swingin' an axe, myself.[A][N]
But I'm in too deep with this[N]
whole duty thing.[A][N]
So I guess I would if[N]
I had to.[A][N]
But you seem more flexible than I.[N]
You have nothing tying you down.[A][N]
How you live and die is all[N]
you own choice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Guess so. Thanks, kid.[A][N]
You're sometimes good at[N]
givin' advice, I'll say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thanks. It's a hobby.[A][X]

I've noticed your grief,[N]
your highness.[A][N]
Your festering regret[N]
over those mercenaries.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I just wish to warn you that[N]
as the king of Elba Cor,[A][N]
you'll experience far worse[N]
heartache.[A] At least, if you[N]
take failures so personally.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[...] just who I am, Hyperius.[A][N]
Much as I wish I could, I can't[N]
change how I feel.[A][N]
I[...] still don't know if I'm[N]
good enough for Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've the heart of a king.[N]
[...]Almost too large a heart.[A][N]
[...]I cannot say for certain[N]
if that's good or bad.[A][N]
But if you grieve like this for[N]
people you never knew,[A][N]
how would you react to a true[N]
crisis within the kingdom?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Like it or not, you are[N]
the kingdom's future.[A][N]
[...]Don't forget, though.[A][N]
If you falter or find yourself[N]
afraid, I shall be there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I truly appreciate it.[A][X]

Greetings, young one.[N]
What can I help you with?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've mentioned correspondance[N]
with Opistia.[A] Could[...] you[N]
send this letter, potentially?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. If it's not too[N]
bold, might I ask its contents?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fair enough. I won't pry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Apologies, Archbishop.[N]
It's[...] private.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need to apologize.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm[...] afraid. That they'll[N]
accept me.[A][N]
Realize that they were wrong.[N]
That I'll have to forgive them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Is that wrong of me?[N]
After everything?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Only you can answer[N]
that for yourself, child.[A][N]
[...]Sometimes it hurts to heal.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thank you. Let me know[...][N]
if they respond.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

She had wanted something new.[N]
And I guess so had I.[A][N]

Never knew the guy, but for that[N]
I always kinda hated him.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Sorry to 'ear, lass.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So are you gonna drop[N]
this pretense any time soon?[A][N]
You clearly know something.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]

[...]Must be a big shocker.[A][N]
But[...] This is the happiest[N]
moment o' me life.[A][X]

I've been in correspondance with[N]

That's correct. Once he's here,[N]
I'll be able to fight to my fullest.[A][N]
As for whether you wish for me[N]
to saddle up during this fight[...][A][N]
Or if you'd rather hold off and[N]
let me do so afterwards[...][A][N]
Well, I trust your judgement.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright. Thank you. This'll[N]
be helpful to know.[A][N]
