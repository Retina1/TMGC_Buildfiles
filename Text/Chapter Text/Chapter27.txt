[...]Good for her, honestly.[A][N]
[...]Hm. I guess if there's three[N]

Would have to work with Rachael, but I[N]

I could probably put up with her.[A][X]

##Ch27_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungGirard][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungElcorian][OpenMidLeft]
Tell me, Elcorian. How are your[N]
studies progressing?[A][N]
I have my own thoughts, of course.[N]
But I'm curious to hear yours.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
To be honest, Lord Arbordia[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've told you, you can call[N]
me Girard.[A] I like to imagine[N]
that we are peers. Equals.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Girard. I[...] hardly feel like[N]
I've done enough.[A][N]
Every avenue I peer down[N]
is but a dead end.[A][N]
[...]Does[...] Does any of what I[N]
do even have meaning?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, Elcorian. That is the[N]
unfortunate lot of the scholar.[A][N]
Hundreds of hours chasing the[N]
unknown down every path,[A][N]
only to find even more nothing[N]
at the end of most.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But what makes it all worth it is[N]
that one groundbreaking discovery.[A][N]
Perhaps you're years out from finding[N]
it.[A] Perhaps you'll find it tomorrow.[A][N]
Either way, I do truly have faith[N]
in your abilities, Elcorian.[A][N]
Just know that what you're feeling is[N]
something entirely normal.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If[...] If you're certain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Maybe what you need is a bit[N]
more inspiration.[A][N]
There's a facility I know of[N]
that I haven't yet showed you.[A][N]
Ethyl's[...] run a few projects there.[N]
Perhaps you can learn something.[A][N]
Won't be a long trip. There's still[N]
much to learn in Arbordia.[A][N]
But a fresh environment might[N]
help you out of this funk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I appreciate it, sir.[N]
[...]Girard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course.[A][X]

Clarque! I[...] I remember you.[A][N]
Do you[...] Where is[...]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]The kid? There's[...][A][CloseEyes] no easy[N]
way for me to tell you this.[A][N]
[...]They fell. Most of the group did.[N]
It was[...] a horrific massacre.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[...] I always knew that[N]
this could happen[...][A][N]
But they were still[...] so young[...][N]
So much[...] they could've done[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I[...] saw it all. I could've[...][N]
changed everything.[A] [...]That's what[N]
I like to tell myself, anyway.[A][N]
[...]I would've died myself for trying.[N]
And even so. Maybe that[...][A] Maybe[N]
it wouldn't have been a bad thing.[A][N]
[...]Look at me. I spend years bringing[N]
nothing but problems into the world.[A][N]
And now I'm telling a mother that their[N]
child is dead.[A] [...]I'm[...] truly[N]
a worthless wretch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Viridian[...] always thought the[N]
world of you, Clarque.[A][N]
That's[...] something to be proud of.[A][N]
[...]If you think your life doesn't have[N]
any worth, then give it some.[A][N]
If you fight for their legacy,[N]
then I will too.[A][N][OpenEyes]
We[...] will mourn together.[N]
But we won't give in.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

This[...] isn't like[N]
you, Freddric.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Viridian fell alongside[N]
most of the others.[A][N]
I[...] I only survived because[N]
I was sent ahead to scout.[A][N]
[...]I[...] I should've[...][A][N]
It should've been[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No[...] Viridian[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
I[...] I always knew that[N]
this could happen[...][A][N]
But they were still[...] so young[...][N]
So much[...] they could've done[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] hardly know how or why[N]
I'm still going now.[A][N]
[...]It would be easy to throw[N]
myself at the enemy's blade.[A][N]
But[...] I still see Viridian[N]
calling my name.[A][N]
Telling me to keep going.[N]
Keep holding on hope.[A][N]
[...]For what?[A][N]
[...]I'm[...] I'm sorry.[A][N]
I can't possible imagine how[N]
much you must be hurting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It[...] It's alright.[A][N]
We will grieve together.[A][N]
I[...] I know how you two felt[N]

Are they with Aercolyn?[A][N]
[...]But then[...] Where would Viridian[...][N]

I'll[...] fall in with Aercolyn.[N]
My skills haven't failed me.[A][N]
I'll see if I can grab some[N]

Once things calm down, I'll[N]

##Ch27_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Girard retreated into the hall.[N]
But besides that, we've won.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's good. Still, we shouldn't[N]
risk taking too long to prepare.[A][N]
We don't know what he has planned.[N]
[...]Or where Elcorian is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Girard was quite on top of our assault.[A][N]
I can't tell if we've exhausted his options[N]
or if he still has another card to play.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd think he'd wish to keep us out of[N]
the Arbordian Hall entirely.[A][N]
For symbolic reasons, if nothing else.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Makes sense to me.[A] In that case,[N]
we'll rest a moment,[A] then press[N]
our offensive further.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alright.[A] [...]Despite what I said,[N]
I still[...] feel uneasy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get it. But this'll all be over soon.[N]
[...]We move when you're ready.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Alright. [...]Let us hope this[N]
will all be worth it.[A][X]

If you'd rather she not change[N]

Either way, she will get the ability[N]

Change Rose's class to Assassin?[N]
[No][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
We've almost arrived.[N]
[...]It's time, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't fear. We've come this far.[N]
We're sure to triumph.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[N]
[...]The plan's unchanged.[A][N]
We split our forces and converge[N]
inside of the city's walls.[A][N]
If we can take the governmental[N]
hall,[A] we should be able to[N]
corner Lord Arbordia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ideally. If things go rough,[N]
we may have to improvise.[A][N]
[...]But we will win. I'm certain.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Good luck, Zeke.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You as well, Blair.[A][X]

happens,[A] we will be several[N]
steps ahead of the invaders![A][N]
Bowmen, take to our ramparts![N]
Elites, come to our defense![A][N]
Come and avenge the great[N]

Forces of Aercolyn[...] I am truly[N]
honored to have lead you this far.[A][N]
It's[...] more than I ever could've[N]

I've sometimes wondered if my life[N]
truly means anything.[A][N]
[...]But if I get to lead you all to[N]
a brighter Dalst[...][A][N]

worth it.[A][ToggleSmile] [...]To victory![A][X]

My friends[...] We've come so[N]
far together.[A] I like to think[N]
there's no greater force than us.[A][N]
And that's why today, I'm counting[N]
on everyone to deliver us.[A][N]
Deliver us from the shadows that[N]

your skills.[A][N]
Have at me, youths of today![A][X]

##C27GirardBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
We do this for the future[N]

meaningless in the end.[A][N]
If you do not recognize this,[N]
you have no place among us.[A][N]
[...]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C27GirardBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
It does not bring me joy[N]
to fight one of Dalst.[A][N]
And yet, perhaps this is[N]
what your blood deserves.[A][N]

Alas. That is in ages past.[A][N]
All I can do now is finally[N]

The idol of our tenacity.[A][N]
And all the more unfortunate[N]
that you must be extinguished.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I have nothing to say to you.[A][N]
We shall free the continent[N]

Corruption? I - we're the only[N]

The only ones who know how to[N]
make the hard choices.[A][N]
The ones willing to do what[N]
must be done for our future.[A][N]
You have been given a great[N]

Don't try to sway me, Girard.[A][N]
You're but another obstacle in[N]

I would never dream of trying.[N]
You're a stubborn young man.[A][N]
Much unlike your father.[A][N]

If he was a man so eager to[N]

It is truly a shame to dispose[N]
of such a valuable asset.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
After what I've seen you do[N]

It serves Aercolyn and Blair.[A][N]

Besides, it is him who has[N]

Nothing has to change for[N]

But I know everything about[N]

They're taking a straightforward approach.[N]
How bold of them.[A] [...]Alert the southern[N]

Distracting our forces to mount a direct[N]

We will have to wait and see.[A][X]

##C27EastWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
Taking the side entrance into the city[...][N]
Not a terrible approach at all.[A][N]
[...]Move our armored divsion in.[A][N]
Hold the invaders up while we prepare[N]

That chokepoint will hopefully be[N]
their demise.[A][X]
##C27EastWarningAlt

A diversion while they sneak through[N]

Still, we've ample men to reinforce the[N]

The waterbound entrance. An obvious[N]
weakness for any invader to exploit.[A][N]
[...]And of course, one with an obvious[N]
solution.[A] Dispatch our flier division.[A][N]
