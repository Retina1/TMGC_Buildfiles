Our only move, really[...] is waiting[N]

Then we make our stand.[A][N]
We'll have watch posted constantly,[N]

I'd like to think so.[A][N]
[...]I guess from a certain point[N]
of view, it's not that simple.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]I could see how we're driven[N]
by a desire for revenge.[A][N]
But at the same time, we can't[N]
just leave Dalst be.[A][N]
Nor would it be right to bend[N]
our knee to them.[A][N]
Not after what they did.[A][N]
[...]At the same time, though[...][A][N]
I don't want to hurt the people[N]
of Dalst, if I can avoid it.[A][N]
But[...] with the instability[N]
that might come of this[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This all sounds so complicated.[A][N]
I guess that's what being a hero[N]
is.[A] Being able to make the right[N]
choice even through this confusion.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You could say that.[A][N]
[...]I do truly hope you don't[N]

Do you think I've changed[N]

How so? I'd say we've[N]
all changed in some way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, obviously we've grown[N]
stronger.[A] That's our way[N]
of the world.[A] Fight to grow[N]

But that doesn't mean you're a[N]

Perhaps one could argue that.[A][N]
But as he himself has stated, he[N]
couldn't let you fight this alone.[A][N]
It has ultimately been his choice to[N]

Weren't you just at some[N]

path long ago.[A][N]
Guess there'll probably still[N]
be things to do after this war.[A][N]
If the revolution's taught me[N]
anything,[A] it's that nobody's[N]
truly happy with change.[A][N]
Whatever we do, whoever we[N]
depose[...][A] Someone's gonna[N]
get up in arms about it.[A][N]
And maybe I could be the one[N]

Well, that's part of the mystery.[A][N]
Scholars can't agree what this bow[N]
actually functioned as.[A][N]
Some say it could shoot in close[N]
quarters, thanks to its small size.[A][N]
Others say that it was intended to[N]
shoot several times as fast,[A][N]
since its small size means less[N]
travel time for the arms.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Interesting[...] Is that there just[N]
a replica?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Technically, it's functional.[A][N]
But it's extremely impractical to use.[N]

[...]I'm quite sure I don't plan[N]

Ha! Don't worry. You're too[N]
kind to betray my trust.[A][N]

I can smell treachery where it is.[A][N]

Right[...] Of course.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate you getting Tarquin[N]

Lady Blair! Do you need me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm just stopping by to say hello.[A][N]
[...]I'm sorry for what Neillstrom did[N]
to your country.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hardly your doing, I'd say.[A][N]
I'm sure when you knew him, he[N]
always seemed a reasonable man.[A][N]
[...]Alas, he thought less than nothing[N]
of the Yg'stran nation.[A][N]
It was but a trophy of Dalst.[N]
That, and a treasury of loot.[A][N]
[...]But things had to change.[N]
Do you know of Lazarus?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] do. Well, did.[A][N]
We're the ones who brought[N]
an end to him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks for that![A][N]
But anyway, after his death,[N]
we found some correspondence.[A][N]
It appears he had been writing[N]
letters to someone in Dalst.[A][N]
It seems that he was[...] some[N]
manner of plant.[A] He were to[N]
infiltrate Yg'stra via our tournament,[A][N]
then I guess somehow stir up chaos[N]
and disarray?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] had no idea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Funny thing is, his loyalties[N]
still seemed quite tenuous.[A][N]
Judging by his final letter,[A][N]
he was planning on aiming his[N]
sights squarely at Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Was[...] Dalst trying to force this[N]
war from the beginning?[A][N]
What[...] could they get out of[N]
provoking Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your guess is as good as mine.[A][N]
In any case, that's a reason to[N]
bring this conflict to an end.[A][N]
No more intrigue. No more deception.[N]
No more wars.[A][N]
Just our nations, coexisting.[A][N]
Growing. Flourishing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I quite like the sound of that.[A][X]

You've nothin' to apologize for, lass.[N]
Not like you were the aggressor.[A][N]

Hm[...] How about the one time I wrestled[N]
down a bear entirely bare-handed?[A][N]
[...]Well, that'd be a lie. It wasn't just[N]

What would ever make you[N]

[...]A miserable upbringing where I was[N]

A life in the arena, where every coin[N]

This is quite the castle[N]

Reminds me of the story of[N]
how I lost my arm.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How so? [...]Don't tell me you[N]
lost it here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hardly.[A] 'Twas a journey in[N]
a distant land.[A] I and some[N]
friends were hired for a job.[A][N]
An assassination, in particular.[A][N]
I was to assassinate, and the[N]
others to infiltrate.[A][N]
Sadly, our target was[...] wiser[N]
than our client let on.[A][N]
Quite the swordsman too.[A][N]
He fell in the end, but he took[N]
my arm with him.[A] I[...] had[N]
considered giving in there.[A][N]
Hanging up my blade.[A][N]
But I yearned for adventures.[N]
For new stories to tell.[A][N]
And with practice, I got back[N]
to my former skill.[A][N]
Perhaps even more.[A][N]
Plus, people underestimate me.[A][N]
Always a bit of a joy to show[N]
them a real surprise.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did you say assassination?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I've taken on some odd jobs[N]

[...]Truly, I'm a wretched father for[N]
letting them grow up like that.[A][N]
I've[...] let many people down.[N]
Them. Viridian. My country.[A][N]
[...]Something inside of me is[N]
irreparable.[A] And it breaks[N]
everyone I meet.[A][N]
[...]But something else inside of[N]
me refuses to stop.[A][N]

Well, I won't sugarcoat it.[A][N]
An extremely dangerous battle.[N]
[...]I don't expect us all to survive.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Knowing that, I still have to[N]
drum up hope and morale in our men.[A][N]
It's[...] hard. Especially after[N]

A field that may very well[N]
claim their lives.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

what you face constantly.[A][N]

It's proof you're something[N]
special, milady.[A][N]
[...]I[...] ought to get back to[N]
this.[A] Who'd think I'd get[N]
caught up on simple words?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
I'm glad someone as considerate[N]

##I10VladmirTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Might I ask something, Archbishop?[N]
[...]Is it okay for you to be here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[...] You're concerned about Opistia's[N]
involvement in Dalstian affairs.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dalst and Opistia have long been allies.[N]
Wouldn't interceding cause[...] problems?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps it would. But I'd say there'd[N]
be larger problems letting this slide.[A][N]
Turning a blind eye to injustices is[N]
hardly becoming of His followers.[A][N]
And it is the duty of the fellow man[N]
to set a sinner upon the right track.[A][N]
[...]To look at it from a pragmatic lens,[N]
it will only be an issue if you fail.[A][N]
And I have witnessed your ability.[N]
I have faith in you. In us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Hardly what I imagined you saying.[N]
But I appreciate it nonetheless.[A][N]
[...]By the way, I don't remember if I[N]
ever thanked you for Yg'stra.[A][N]
So[...] thanks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If anything, you deserve commendation.[N]
But let's not get lost in praise.[A][N]
There's much to prepare. I shall[N]
write back to Opistia.[A][N]
They deserve to know what transpires.[A][N]
May He guide your preparations well.[A][X]

Not you, though. You're just[N]
