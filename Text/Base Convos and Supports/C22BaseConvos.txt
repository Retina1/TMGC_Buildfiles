How goeth the women, Todd?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not towards me, sadly.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have you tried talking?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course not! Again.[N]
Natural charm.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're talking to me right now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] different.[N]
You genuinely tolerate me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hope.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Maybe that's what you need.[A][N]
Don't think of people as quick[N]
fun. Think of them as people.[A][N]
As friends.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not even the world's longest text[N]
could contain the list of my romances.[A][N]
You think I can juggle thinking[N]
of all them as friends?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Maybe narrow it down to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] half a dozen.[N]
Six real friends. Real connections.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And then have a sevensome?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see your point.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Quality over quantity![A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Greetings, chronicler.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you not recognize me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why should I?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't play dumb. You're one[N]
of our projects.[A][N]
I believe you escaped years ago.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So what if I am?[N]
Think you can take me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I admit, I'm not quite sure[N]
if you can be contained.[A][N]
But worry not. I just wish[N]
to observe you from here on.[A][N]
See what you can do with a[N]
barely cobbled-together existence.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Kid. What're you doin'?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hi, Mister Jeff! I'm just[N]
reading up on the basics.[A][N]
A good hero keeps himself[N]
well-practiced.[A][N]
How about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just pacing. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How can[N]
you be so happy?[A][N]
This world sucks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I disagree. And even if it did,[N]
I'd like to make it better.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Making the world better[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What has it ever done for you?[A][N]
You're a kid with no parents.[N]
Sounds like the world's cruel.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've met so many[N]
amazing people lately.[A][N]
I've had the chance to put[N]
smiles on so many faces.[A][N]
To be a hero![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I like to see that as the[N]
world saying sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ever the optimist, I see.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've had an easy life.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I like this? I never[N]
earned this bitterness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you sad, mister?[N]
Can I help?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe you can.[A][X]

Heya, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Natasia. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been[N]
wondering something.[A][N]
Don't want to make you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
uncomfortable,[A] so if you[N]
want me to stop, tell me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What in the hell[N]
are you gonna ask?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know I like to know things.[N]
Certainty[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comforts me.[A][N]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I wish to know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Did it ever[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mean anything?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we had?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I guess it did.[A][N]
It helped me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] find myself.[N]
Realize what I am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad to hear that.[N]
Let us never speak of it again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's ancient history now.[A][N]
We didn't know what we wanted,[N]
and we hardly tried to learn.[A][N]
But, hey. We're here now, beatin'[N]
up some chumps.[A][N]
So I'd say everything's coming[N]
up Natasia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wouldn't have expected this[N]
introspection out of you.[A][N]
You're right, though. All's well[N]
that ends well.[A][N]
And your current friendship's[N]
worth far more than[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
whatever you'd call that[N]
fleeting infatuation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to hear you think[N]
so highly of me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you stop, I'll whack[N]
some sense into you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Well, then. Guess[N]
I'll have to keep on my toes.[A][X]

##C22_Stefan_Carbon_Base

Heya, Stefan. Any outlandish[N]
ideas today?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Outlandish? I mean,[N]
I've got ideas.[A][N]
But they're perfectly[N]
reasonable, friend![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Like the time you suggested[N]
I get a REALLY big bow,[A][N]
and shoot swords with it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've since realized that's[N]
not the best idea.[A][N]
Lances would fly better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's wrong with some[N]
creativity?[A][N]
We're in life-or-death[N]
situations on the daily.[A][N]
Who knows when ingenuity[N]
will save the day?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't get me wrong. I like[N]
these ideas.[A] But they're[N]
all very impractical.[A][N]
And that's coming from me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps so. But I'd rather have one hundred[N]
absurd ideas than none at all.[A][N]
One of them's gotta be good.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]When you put it like that,[N]
I guess it makes sense.[A][N]
Well, then. Hit me with[N]
some rapidfire.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Freezing the ground so we can[N]
slide along it faster.[A][N]
Taping together a sword, lance, and[N]
axe so we never face a bad matchup.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A spell that teleports chairs so[N]
Lady Blair can seize more easily![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Greetings, Athena![N]
And greetings, Perseus![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello, Josef. What's that[N]
you have?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've collected our rationed leftovers[N]
and sorted out what nobody wants to eat.[A][N]
I feel Percy here deserves a bit of[N]
a treat after all he's done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]He doesn't seem too pleased[N]
looking at it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wouldn't be either,[A][N]
if my meal was a loaf of somewhat[N]
stale bread and some cold stew.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's just the first course.[N]
Look at this, pal.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Some fresh bear. Who knew our[N]
hunters were so skilled?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you excited now, friend?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're getting[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a little close.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pal[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The food's there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm not your snack.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course I am.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Woah![A][N][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]
That was quite a big bite, fella![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you like it?[A][N]
Will you promise not to eat me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you never seen a wyvern[N]
eat before? It's a spectacle.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That it is.[A][N]
By the by, I also cooked you[N]
up a bit of game.[A][N]
No need to tear into it[N]
as dramatically as him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][X]

Still with us, I see.[N]
You're something special.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm just doing my duty, sir![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even so, I'd bet a majority of[N]
recruits would've left by now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Could hardly even blame them.[A][N]
But you're dedicated to our[N]
crown like few other.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say. I'll need a successor[N]
someday. I'm getting old.[A][N]
I think you might have what[N]
it takes to take after my role.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you sure? That'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
be incredible![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. You're still very young,[N]
but I've an understanding of you.[A][N]
In any case, such a transition would[N]
happen once we're in peacetime.[A][N]
For now, just continue what you're[N]
doing. You're a boon to us all.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course, sir. I'll never[N]
stop fighting for us all.[A][X]
