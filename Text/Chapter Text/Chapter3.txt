[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenFarRight][LoadEthyl][OpenRight][LoadGirard]
Elcorian. Lady Aercolyn. It's good[N]
to see you well.[A] I've heard news[N]
of Yg'stra's actions in Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Yg'stra took Aercolyn's barracks, and[N]
by the time we reclaimed them[...][A][N]
Almost every last one of our soldiers[N]
stationed within were gone.[A][N]
What do you suggest[N]
we do, Lord Arbordia?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]A strike after negotiations[N]
fell silent[...] This bodes ill.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I suggest you bite back as[N]
good as they bit you.[A][N]
If they're spitting on our peace,[N]
spit right back on their graves.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Perhaps Lady Ciraweiss's words[N]
are somewhat extreme.[A][N]
But her intent rings true.[N]
This cannot go unpunished.[A][N]
[...]I think first it may be wise[N]
to scope them out.[A][N]
I believe they've an outpost[N]
at the edge of the Lowlands.[A][N]
[...]You can lead a force to take[N]
that outpost.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Me?[A][N][OpenRight]
Consider this a test of loyalty.[A][N]
This is a matter that may very[N]
well impact the rest of Dalst.[A][N]
And it would be ideal for Lord[N]
Neillstrom to prepare a defense.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Surely with what experience you've[N]
accumulated, you can manage this.[A][N]
You handling this would make a very[N]
strong case for your legitimacy.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I[...] I guess that makes[N]
enough sense to me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It may be somewhat above what[N]
you've done thus far,[A] but I[N]
have faith that you will rise.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Well, if that's settled.[N]
You can be off now.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadArin]
[...]With all due respect, you can't[N]
quite be serious.[A] Aercolyn's forces[N]
are[...] Well, nonexistent, currently.[A][N]
Do you just expect to send us off?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]What's this?[Event][A][N][OpenLeft]
It sounds as if you don't plan to[N]
spare any Dalstian troops.[A][N]
Or any aid at all.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Well. That's not untrue.[A][N]
But surely, if you're as sincere[N]
towards our cause as you claim,[A][N]
you'll find some way to handle this.[A][N]
[...]Or perhaps the name Aercolyn still[N]
means nothing worth a damn.[A][N][OpenLeft]
So you'll send us to die[N]
for a laugh?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Arin.[A] It's[...] alright. We'll[...] make do[N]
with what we have.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenRight]
If I may. While Ciraweiss is perhaps[N]
somewhat ahead of herself,[A] I do see[N]
the value in this being your exodus.[OpenLeft][CloseEyes][OpenRight][A][N]
After all, you are currently the only[N]
one with anything at stake.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadElcorian]
Still[...] When I said she would[N]
rise, I hardly imagined alone.[A][N]
Marching with no backup now[N]
would be nothing but suicidal.[A][N][OpenRight]
That too, is true. [...]Dalst shall spare[N]
a handful of troops of Barford.[A][N]
Truly, we wish we could help more,[N]
but we cannot take any risks,[A][N]
and so this is all we can offer.[A][N]
In return, for taking on this task,[A][N]
I believe you may find yourself in[N]
a truly favorable position.[A][N]
[...]Do I make myself clear?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You[...] You do.[A][N][OpenRight]
Excellent. Now, then. I'd prepare[N]
yourself. Good day, Aercolyn.[A][N]
[...]And I do truly apologize for[N]
Ciraweiss's decorum.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][Event][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]That[...] could have gone worse.[A][N]
Are you truly alright with this?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's[...] not ideal. But I'm a bit[N]
too far to back down now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Remember, this mission is little[N]
more than reconnaissance.[A][N]
If things get too dangerous, there[N]
is no shame in living another day.[A][N][OpenLeft][LoadArin]
[...]I'll make sure she doesn't[N]
do anything too dangerous.[A][N]
[...]Apologies if I was out of line.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hardly. [...]I've no idea what's[N]
stirred Lady Ethyl so.[A][N]
But your concerns were completely[N]
reasonable.[A] [...]Now, then. I must[N]
be off. Best of luck.[A][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I'm sorry for getting us[N]
in over our heads again.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It is what it is. You hardly[N]
had too much choice.[A][N]
[...]And perhaps they weren't[N]
entirely incorrect.[A][N]
You've grown in battle quickly.[N]
Perhaps you can lead us to victory.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Let's hope you're right.[A][N]
But first, we ought to prepare.[A][X]

##Ch3_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We're finally here. It's[...][N]
a lot more intimidating, now.[A][N]
Leading this charge, that is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're aware the troops Dalst[N]
promised haven't arrived yet, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure they'll come.[A][N]
And even if not, I'm sure we'll[N]
be able to pull this off.[A][N]
[...]We have to be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ever the optimist. [...]In any case,[N]
we should prepare to strike.[A][N]
We won't go unnoticed much longer now.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds good with me.[A][X]

##Ch3_Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenLeft]
Have[...] Have we done it?[N]
Have we won?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]It appears we have.[A][N]
I believe it would be prudent to[N]
return to Arbordia,[A][N]
and report what's happened.[A][N]
With more support from Dalst, we could[N]
likely push deeper into Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadLazarus][Event]You shall report to nobody today.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][Event]
[...]Mere children took you down, Helga?[N]
How disappointing.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]A-Are you[...] their commmander?[A][N]
Why did Yg'stra attack Dalst?[A][N]
What happened to those in[N]
the barracks!?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You dare question me? Do you[N]
realize your position?[A][N]
You stand before history's greatest:[N]
Lazarus, of Yg'stra![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Blair, we have to run.[A][N]
We can't possibly stand[N]
against this man now.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]But[...] No, you're right.[N]
There will always be another chance.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]So, you DO value your lives.[A][N]
Let's make this sporting, then. It's not[...][N]
satisfying, after all, if there's no struggle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]Sir Lazarus! They're escaping![N]
Your orders?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Let them run. Only pursue on my orders.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]But, sir! The orders were to take as[N]
many alive as possible![A] Surely we can[N]
capture them now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Did you mishear me?[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]The only orders you heed are MY direct orders.[N]
And I say[...] we feed them false hope.[A][N]
Young lordling[...] Value whatever time[N]
you have left.[A] Know you're nothing[N]
but a stepping stone towards Elba Cor.[A][X]


##Ch3_Sam_Joins
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam]
Please, wait up![N]
You're Lady Blair, correct?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That's me![N]
[...]Who are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]Right. My name is Sam.[A][N]
I'm[...] recently recruited into[N]
the Dalstian army.[A][N]
They felt you'd need backup.[N]
[...]Chose me and some other guy.[A][N]
Where is he, anyway?[A][N]
You'd think a man in heavy armor[N]
wouldn't beat an agile young woman[...][A][N]
Anyway, I'm good with a bow.[N]
Relatively speaking.[A] I just picked[N]
it up, but I'm already skilled, I think.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Glad to have you here![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][...]One more thing.[A][N]
According to Dalstian intelligence,[N]
there's some ballistae here.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[...] They'll easily outrange us,[A][N]
and I'd imagine they have enough ammunition[N]
to never run out before we die[...][A][N]
We'll have to prioritize them.[N]
Thanks for the tip, Sam![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly! Just[...] don't leave[N]
me behind, please.[A][X]

##Ch3_Josef_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Ah! Would you happen to be Lady Blair?[N]
The name's Josef. Pleasure to meet you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I presume you're the other soldier[N]
Dalst sent? I've already met Sam.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, Sam. What a character.[N]
Young, but she's got spirit.[A][N]
Of course, I just had to rush ahead.[A][N]
After all, if there's anyone who can hold[N]
those Yg'strans off, it's me.[A][N]
Try as they may, they'll never breach[N]
my rock-solid armor![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see, I see[...][N]
But what if I did this?[A][MoveMidLeft][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Eeep![A][N]
[...]Milady, I ask you not joke like that.[N]
Magic is no laughing matter.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Apologies.[A][N]
[...]Though, that was pretty funny.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]If you consider doing that again[...][N]
I'll[...] uh[...][A][N]
[...]Please don't do that.[A][X]

##C3HelgaBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga]
You think you're tough?[A][N]
Well, I've never lost a[N]
battle before.[A][N]
That's not gonna change[N]
any time soon![A][X]

##C3HelgaDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga][ToggleSmile]
Heh[...] My first loss[...][N]
No matter[...][A][N]
General[...] Lazarus[...][N]
will be[...] seeing you[...][A][X]

##C3VillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
Hello there! Wanna play with me?[A][N]
[...]No? Aw, shucks![N]
Who'll I play with now?[A][N]
Ever since everyone's gone off to war,[N]
it's been lonely around here[...][A][N]
You know what I think?[N]
I think war is stupid![A][N]
[...]Sorry I said a bad word.[A][N]
Take this as an apology, and maybe[N]
come play with me later, please?[A][X]

##C3SamJosefTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Um[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aha! What is it, young lady?[N]
Are you quite alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Never mind![N]
Never[...] mind[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did I come on too strong?[N]
Scare her off?[A] [...]I'm sure she'll[N]
be back to talk. One day.[A][X]

##C3SamJosefRecruitment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Um[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aha! What is it, young lady?[N]
Are you quite alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Never mind![N]
Never[...] mind[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did I come on too strong?[N]
Scare her off?[A] [...]I'm sure she'll[N]
be back to talk. One day.[A][N]
In any case, I guess that means[N]
the others are here.[A][N]
Time to get to work.[A][X]

##C3Hint
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHelga]
Remember the plan! Once the[N]
Dalstians open the door,[A][N]
that's when we send in[N]
the reinforcements![A][X]
