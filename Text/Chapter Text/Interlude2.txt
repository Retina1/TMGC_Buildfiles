##I2_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Well, here we are. Kionius,[N]
the capital of Mevion.[A][N]
Thankfully, Peggy was right-[N]
we don't really stick out anymore.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What do we do, now that we're here?[N]
We can't stay here forever.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]That's where we run into problems.[A][N]
We're foreigners, so I'm not even clear[N]
on governmental procedure here,[A][N]
and assuming we get an audience with the[N]
parliament,[A] there's no guarantee we'd even[N]
get any assistance.[A] At the same time...[N]
what other choice do we have?[A][N]
But enough of that. Yg'stra's seemingly given[N]
up on chasing us, so we've room to breathe.[A][N]
I think after everything we've been through,[N]
a short break is in order.[A][N]
Plus, our supplies are likely in need[N]
of restocking.[A][N]
Now's a better time than ever to just[N]
take a moment and take in the scenery.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course... That all makes sense.[N]
No time like the present, then.[A][N]
Prepare to advance![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...This isn't a real battle, Blair.[N]
But I'll humor you.[A][X]

##I2MerchantTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Oh, hello there. Are... are you[N]
here to buy something?[A][N]
That's... quite unexpected.[N]
Most just pass me by.[A][N]
Well, I've got this peculiar scroll[N]
burning a hole in my pocket.[A][N]
Not literally, of course.[N]
...I hope.[A] Scrolls do weird[N]
things, y'know.[A][N]
This one seems to hasten those[N]
with few burdens.[A][N]
As for price... How's 1683[N]
sound?[A] It's weird... but it[N]
FEELS lucky to me.[A][X]

##I2NoMoneyHa
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Damn... Guess you don't have enough.[N]
Well, I'll stick around a while.[A][N]
...Really thought 1683 would[N]
be luckier.[A][X]

##I2SkillBuy
Purchase a peculiar scroll?[N]
[Yes][X]

##I2SkillPurchased
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. Here you go.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, young lady![A][N]
Speaking of burning holes, if that[N]
scroll sets itself on fire,[A][N]
I don't think that's intended[N]
behavior. Just so you know.[A][X]

##I2SkillDenied
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5][OpenMidLeft]
...No thank you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Understandable. I'll be here[N]
if you change your mind.[A][N]
...Really thought 1683 would[N]
be luckier.[A][X]

##I2CitTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Captain Cid's really somethin', you know.[N]
Sure, he's one of them piratey types,[A][N]
and normally I'd trust them as far[N]
as I can throw them.[A] But Cid...[N]
Well, as I said. Really somethin'.[A][N]
His heart's large as his muscles,[N]
and, well, that's saying something.[A][N]
Of course, those muscles aren't just[N]
for show.[A] There's a reason he's a[N]
feared legend of the high seas.[A][N]
...You fought alongside him?[N]
Must've been quite spectacular![A][N]
I'm almost jealous.[N]
...Almost.[A][X]


##I2Cit2Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6]
Why, hello there, young lady![N]
Care to talk to an old man?[A][N]
You look like you'd hardly remember[N]
the days of the revolution![A][N]
Let me tell you, that was something else.[A][N]
I was already a bit too old to fight,[N]
but my son jumped at the chance.[A][N]
He, like most of us, wanted a better Mevion,[N]
and he was a fiery one![A] Willing to fight[N]
tooth and nail for all of us.[A][N]
Oh, he's still alive. Don't worry.[N]
Moved to a small settlement near the sea.[A][N]
I think it's about time I write[N]
to him again, see how he's doing.[A][X]

##I2HyperiusTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Ah, Lady Blair. Admirably done.[N]
Both here and at Loile.[A][N]
To be frank, I once had my doubts[N]
about the king trusting an outsider,[A][N]
but it appears my judgement was[N]
both in haste and error.[A][N]
Forgive me.[A] As for what I'm[N]
doing now...[A][N]
It's... a highly personal matter.[A][N]
Quite possibly nothing will come of it.[N]
But it's something that has to be done.[A][N]
And, well... If I am right...[A][N]
Suffice to say it'll be a glorious[N]
day for all in the kingdom.[A][N]
Oh, but forgive my ramblings.[N]
I ought to prepare for what's ahead.[A][X]

##I2AlexisTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis]
Lady Blair, sir- I mean, ma'am![N]
You are truly a boon to Elba Cor![A][N]
May providence watch over you forever.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Remind me. Who are you, again?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, of course! Apologies![N]
I am Alexis, Elba Cor's young pride![A][N]
As for what I'm doing now...[A][N]
Well, General Hyperius chose me for[N]
a special assignment.[A] Something about[N]
the future of the kingdom.[A][N]
Though I'm but a rookie, I'm sure[N]
I'll live up to his expectations![A][N]
I'm sure you'll make our king proud,[N]
too![A] Know what? You can borrow this.[N]
It's a training weight.[A] Straight from[N]
Elba Cor boot camp.[A] I'm sure it'll[N]
make you stronger than ever![A][X]

##I2CharleyTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Greetings. I am Charley, a humble traveler.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
An archer of some sort,[N]
I presume?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, so you noticed. You could say that.[A][N]
I've shot competitions all throughout the land.[N]
Some would call me a champion... marksman.[A][N]
But to me, the bow is a passion,[N]
not a vehicle for glory.[A][N]
To see the world, see others like me...[N]
Others who share that passion...[A][N]
It's what it truly means to live.[N]
The honors are but an accessory.[A][N]
...Perhaps we'll meet again,[N]
some day. I'd like that.[A][X]

##I2ManfredWilhelmTalk
[OpenFarRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm]
...Fold. Manfred,[N]
you damned genius.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What can I say? I'm just[N]
good at this, Wilhelm.[A][N]
Sadly, I'm not the one squandering[N]
all my keep on the cards.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Yeah, yeah. Deal another hand.[A][N]
...Oh, hey. Didn't notice you there.[N]
You're... Blair, right?[A][N]
The one the king summoned?[N]
Name's Wilhelm, if you didn't know.[A][N]
And that strapping man across the[N]
barrel-slash-makeshift table is Manfred.[A][N]
I've... known him a long time. Call.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Found him facedown drunk in a[N]
ditch in Opistia. ...Raise.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Intersting maneuver...[N]
As I said, long time.[A][N]
Anyway, he was just telling me about[N]
some job he was looking into.[A][N]
Something about a mercenary group.[A][N]
Which, hey. If I can make money[N]
and run from debtors, that's nice.[A][N]
Guess it feels kinda bad leaving Elba Cor[N]
right as a war begins.[A] Alas.[N]
I'm sure they'll be fine without me.[N]
It's what a man has to do. Raise.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]As for me, I've just been looking[N]
for a fresh start.[A] Scholarly work is[N]
fine, I suppose, but I want something new.[A][N]
Plus, it's an excuse to get out of that[N]
scorching hellscape. ...Full house.[A][N]
[OpenRight]God damn it! How do you[N]
keep doing this?![A][N]
Anyway, good seeing you made it out[N]
of that battle alive.[A] ...And[N]
thanks for the help.[A][X]

##I2ConfirmLeave
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Ye all finished here, lassie?[A][X]

##I2NotYet
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
Not quite yet, captain.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Arr! Then get to it![N]
Ye can rest on the seas![A][X]

##I2ReleaseMe
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
I believe so.[A][X]
