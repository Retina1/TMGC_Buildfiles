Brother! It's good to see you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Have they been treating[N]
you alright without me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course they have![N]
No need to worry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Right. Sorry.[A][N]
[...]I found you a little something[N]
when Callum and I were off.[A][N]
Fancy staff, right? Not sure if[N]
you can use it yet,[A] but it[N]
wouldn't hurt to keep around.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate it.[A][N]
If only I found some[N]
shiny axe for you[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Your safety is reward enough.[A][N]
Now, stand back, and watch[N]
your brother at work![A][X]

Ha! Those chumps were nothing![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Agreed. You're impressive.[N]
[...]Not as much as I.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You know what? I'll take that.[N]
Think the others are holdin' up?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd imagine. But once we join the fray[...][N]
Well, it's over for the rebels.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Have I mentioned that this is[N]
SO much better than Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Only four dozen times today.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well. It's true.[A][N]
Maybe it's the money talking.[A][N]
Actually, it's definitely the money.[A][N]
But, hey. That's good a reason as any.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Right. Anyway, let's not delay.[A][N]
Gotta make sure Eliza's okay.[N]
Plus, I got her a nice staff.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[...] do that. I'll just go[N]
and decimate their forces.[A][X]

##V2DirkCallumJoinLTC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDirk][OpenMidRight][LoadCallum]
[...]They're already done?[A][N]
How in the hell? I thought[N]
the two of us were fast[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's impressive, for sure.[N]
My sister's really something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]In any case, no time to[N]
dawdle. We already look bad.[A][X]

[...]Nobody's home. But there's[N]
a note on the table.[A][N]
[OpenQuote]If any heroes see this, please,[N]
take this relic and save our town![CloseQuote][A][N]
[...]There's nothing here but[N]
some sparkling dust.[A][N]
Still, it's probably worth taking.[A][X]

##V2Village2Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman3]
How'd you manage to get in here?[N]
I thought I glued the door shut.[A][N]
[...]Well, there goes my defense.[A][N]
Hey! You'd better keep me safe![A][N]
I've even got a stick that'll help[N]
out with that task![A][X]

##V2Village3Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid1]
You're a mercenary, right?[N]
That's so cool![A][N]
I wanna be a mercenary when[N]
I grow up.[A] Either that, or[N]
maybe an emperor.[A][N]
But for that, I'd need to[N]
be all big and strong.[A][N]
Since you're helping us,[N]
you can have this![A][N]
My daddy bought a bunch of[N]
these a while back.[A][N]
They'll be sure to help[N]
you grow.[A][X]

##V2Village4Text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOlsen][ToggleSmile]
Top of the mornin'! You're fighting[N]
the rebels? That's swell of you.[A][N]
I know what'd be even more swell,[N]
though. If you had one of these.[A][N]
You know what? Here you go. One[N]
fresh greatbow.[A] I can always steal[N]
another.[A] Or kill for another.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile][...]Wait. I probably[N]
shouldn't be saying that.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Whoops.[A][X]

##V2Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenRight][LoadFreddric][OpenFarRight][LoadChartreuse][OpenMidLeft]
We're finished. But[...][N]
What was that?[A][N][OpenRight]
That man leading our foe. He was[...][N]
unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
Already covered in wounds that would've[N]
killed each of us five times over[...][A][N]
And yet, there he stood. And the power[N]
he held was[...] immense.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I could[...] feel it[...][A][N]
Resonating from the other[N]
side of the town.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]We ought to ask if our[N]
client knows anything.[A][N]
If everyone's ready, we can[N]
depart once again.[A][X]

##V2Ending2
[OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
You've done well. As promised,[N]
here's your reward.[A][N]
The 70000 I laid out up front,[N]
plus an extra 30000.[A][N]
That makes it an even 100000.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Thank you for your patronage.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you wish, come stay at[N]
the capital city for a bit.[A][N]
I shall arrange for lodging.[A][N]
Besides, it's possible my[...] colleagues[N]
will wish to speak with you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
More jobs?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Potentially. Of course, you don't[N]
have to commit right now.[A][N]
But I insist. You deserve at least[N]
a few nights in Arbordia's finest.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well, then.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
If I may, sir[...] Their leader was[...][N]
unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
Is there[...] anything you know?[N]
About that?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]No.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N]
Well, then. Viridian.[N]
Shall we head off?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Indeed. We're Arbordia bound, now.[A][X]

##V2Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
You're[...] wizened, Argent.[N]
Do you think this is a good idea?[A][N]
The offer from Dalst, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd hardly call myself wise after[N]
everything that I've been through.[A][N]
Am I truly the best to judge who's[N]
just to fight for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's in the past, though.[N]
We're in the now.[A][N]
This offer just seems[...][N]
too good to be true.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps it is. But you're our leader.[N]
It's your choice to make.[A][N]
Defer to us as much as you'd wish,[N]
but let me tell you something.[A][N]
You're the one who ultimately decides[N]
what we make of this.[A][N]
What we make of all of our battles.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Worst case, if things go south,[N]
we'll fight to the bitter end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, I hardly doubt it'll be[N]
anything that dramatic.[A][N]
But I appreciate the sentiment.[A][N]
[...]Let's do this thing.[A][X]

##V2Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[...]So you must be Viridian.[N]
I am Elcorian.[A][N]
[...]I take it from this that[N]
you're interested in my offer?[A][N][OpenLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N]
What might the nature of this[N]
job be, exactly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Simply put, we're experiencing some[...][N]
civil unrest.[A] Our army is unfortunately[N]
occupied dealing with Yg'stra.[A][N]
Thus, rather than wait and[N]
risk the lives of our citizenry[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're hiring mercenaries.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Good to see[N]
you catch on quick.[A][N]
There appears to be some kind of[N]
man leading this rebellion,[A][N]
and I'd imagine felling him would[N]
be enough to quell it for now.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I see. And[...] if I may ask[...][A][N][Event]
That sword you're concealing at your hip.[N]
Are you[...] proficient in combat?[A][N]
If so[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why do I not fight myself?[A][N]
[...]Perhaps once I was skilled.[N]
But now[...][A] I'm a man of science.[N]
I can[...] hardly fight.[A][N]
And I'd rather not risk my[N]
ideas be lost forever.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Suppose that contradicts your whole[N]
[OpenQuote]for the people[CloseQuote] ideology.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Hardly. I was just curious.[A][N]
To the common man, raising your[N]
blade in their defense is,[A][N]
for all intents and purposes,[A][N]
the same as raising your pen[N]
to sign a merc contract.[A][N]
Perhaps there's an element of cowardice.[A][N]
But at the end of the day, someone's[N]
fighting for the people's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Are you in, then?[A][N]
If so, here's your down payment.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well.[A][N]
[...]Keep it, for now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, we ought to prove ourselves[N]
before being trusted with that sum.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. I shall await results.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[...]What a bizarre man.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hardly different from the nobles[N]
we've fought for in the past.[A][N]
Though, that's the thing.[A][N]
He doesn't strike me as noble.[N]
Just who is he, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
In any case, I believe our target[N]
is further north.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Then, we march.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadArgent]
I shall take Manfred, Wilhelm,[N]
Dirk, and Callum.[A] That might[N]
prove extreme,[A] but caution[N]
never hurt anyone.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred]
Fine by me. You're fun to fight[N]
under. Ain't that right, Wilhelm?[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadWilhelm]
Ayup.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alright, then. Good luck.[A][N]
We'll meet again, assuming[N]
all goes well on our front.[A][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[...]Alright, everyone. You ready?[A][N]
The others are clearing the perimeter,[N]
and may join once that's done.[A][N]
But for now, it's the seven of us.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadRose]
Eight![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Eight. Right. Be careful, Rose.[N]
You're[...] a fragile child.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hmph. I'll show you![A][N][OpenLeft]
It appears they've not noticed[N]
us yet.[A] We should take a moment to[N]
survey and prepare while we have time.[A][N]
It doesn't seem like they're moving[N]
to wreck houses,[A] though we still[N]
ought to check on the citizenry.[A][N]
[...]I also see some ballistae. Those[N]
are[...] not ideal for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry, I won't let you get[N]
pincushioned. Much.[A][N]
In any case, you're right.[A][N]
We wanna do this job well.[A][N]
And for that, we need to prepare[N]
for battle well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well, Viridian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
I'll be helpful, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Sure.[A][X]
