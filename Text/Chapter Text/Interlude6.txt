Lady Blair! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm alright, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! A quick question,[N]
if you'll be so kind.[A][N]
I've been meaning to get[N]
in some sparring.[A][N]
Specifically, some practice[N]
against other swordsmen.[A][N]
I'm wondering if there's anyone[N]
in particular you wish me spar.[A][N]
I'd imagine I'll grow differently[N]
based on my opponent, after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd trust your judgement,[N]
but if you insist,[A][N]
I can pick for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

you feel would suit me best.[A][X]

Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadJeff][OpenMidLeft]
Well met-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, kid. I don't do sparring.[N]
But I suppose I can show you something.[A][N]
See this, here? It's a lockpick.[A][N]
In 20 minutes, it'll be a[N]
golden key for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A key to success![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, just a key to some[N]
sucker's prized riches.[A][X]

##I6EmileConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Ah, Blair. Good to see you.[N]
I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]
I felt since we had time, I should[N]
make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]
devoted the basics of Opistinian magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
but I find it relaxing.[A][N]
I'll do whatever you think best.[A][X]
##I6EmileConvoAnima

I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]

##I6EmileConvoDark
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]

It's always good to push oneself.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]

You know, when you're not constantly[N]
being attacked by bandits,[A][N]
the Lowlands are surprisingly nice.[A][N]
There's a beauty within the ashes.[N]
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad to be away from Mevion.[N]

a rather remarkable view here.[A][N]
The moonlight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How it reflects off[N]
the ashen dusts[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's nice.[A][N][CloseEyes]

Well, yes it is! Your blonde friend[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Natasia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] She taught me a thing or two.[A][N]
Turns out swinging an axe is some[N]
good stress relief![A][N]
Plus, we need the firewood anyway.[N]
It's pretty swell all around.[A][N]
Maybe I'll teach her the basics[N]
of staffing sometime.[A][N]
I told her I wouldn't teach her[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I could learn to teach.[A][N]
Probably.[A] Anyway, keep well,[N]
