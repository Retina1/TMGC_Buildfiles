You're familiar with fightin' in[N]
the dark, right, lassie?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yup! Fought off some[N]
Mevionese.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Good, good. Won't haf'ta start[N]
at the beginnin'.[A] The big difference[N]
with the Loile bandits is their traps.[A][N]
You might've seen torches before,[N]
and them Loiles have torches too.[A][N]
But think about this-[A] they live in[N]
this ashen darkness all the time.[A][N]
What purpose might a torch serve them?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I get it. If we light[N]
a torch,[A] that tells them they've[N]
got bad company.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ye pick up quickly![A][N]
Be careful if you light any torches,[N]
as that may signal our foes.[A][N]
Course, if you can handle it, you may[N]
want to fight some more baddies![A][N]
Worst case, I'll be out there wit' ya,[N]
so victory is basically assured.[A][X]

##C8_Blair_Emile_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Lady Blair! A moment, if you will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No need for formalities, Emile.[N]
Especially since you're older than me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. Anyway, it's been a while[N]
since our last session.[A] Have the[N]
techniques I taught you served you well?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Quite, I'd say. Especially since I've[N]
been in a few more fights than I'd hoped.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's just the way it is, I guess.[A][N]
At least spellcasting is an art valued[N]
both in peace and conflict.[A][N]
The skills you learn on the battlefield[N]
serve you elsewhere too, I'd hope.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Anyway, how's your research been?[A][N]
Besides those recent readings, hadn't[N]
you been studying staves?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yup! There's still so many things we don't[N]
quite know about them,[A] and it's simply[N]
marvelous to dissect what makes them work.[A][N]
I had been working with Elcorian on a[N]
prototype that we called [OpenQuote]Arbitrate.[CloseQuote][A][N]
Imagine a Silence staff, but it can silence[N]
a whole room in an instant.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Last I was there, we were still far[N]
from something that truly worked,[A][N]
but that's the inventor's process.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry if I started rambling there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why would that be an issue? You're just[N]
talking about your passion.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ha. I guess you're right.[N]
Always good to talk to you, Blair.[A][X]

##C8_Stefan_Desmond_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
How've you been holding up, Stefan?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've been quite fine, Sir Desmond![N]
Thanks for checking in.[A][N]
What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
About as well as you could expect,[N]
given everything going on.[A][N]
Almost feels strange, not being[N]
in command like I usually am.[A][N]
Reminds me of my youth, I guess.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you still thinking about what happened?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know I shouldn't think like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But if we were there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If I was there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No use in [OpenQuote]what-ifs[CloseQuote] now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As I believe you've said before[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's up to us to make things right.[A][N]
Wherever everyone is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right, Stefan.[N]
There's always hope.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There sure is, sir![A][X]

##C8_Butch_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's up, Butch?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's your name, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Impressive. Anyway, you're a[N]
royal knight, correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd say more royal errand boy, but[N]
knight works too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Interesting. I'd have thought you[N]
lot would never work with us Mevs.[A][N]
After all, you see us as the culprits[N]
for your prince's death.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As they say, it's ancient history.[A][N]
Besides, I highly doubt you specifically[N]
would be responsible.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Otherwise,[N]
why bring this up?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That's quite the reasonable[N]
response. I'm impressed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose I should ask the same[N]
of you.[A] You're technically fighting[N]
for the king, now.[A] Does that[N]
betray your principles?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]My principles are of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
little value, lately.[A][N]
Living in Mevion sets you up to[N]
live a certain way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. Good meetin' ya, Butch.[A][X]

##C8_Blair_Natasia_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
How're you holdin' up here, Blair?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm quite fine. How about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never better! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Besides it[N]
being a little warm here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd say a little is underselling it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but you're the one wearing[N]
thick mage robes.[A] You must be[N]
absolutely sweltered.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They're lighter than they look.[A][N]
And if the situation demands it,[A][N]
I could just cast an ice spell[N]
at myself.[A] That'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] probably[N]
not end in complete disaster?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whatever you think is best.[A][N]
I'd prefer you not become an[N]
ice cube, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, relax. I was just kidding.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. Don't scare[N]
me like that, Blair.[A][X]

##C8_Kenneth_Natasia_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth][OpenMidLeft]
Say, Kenneth. Is this Loile place[N]
somewhere you're well studied on?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]? Not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] particularly, at least.[N]
Obviously, I know OF it. Who doesn't?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, of course![N]
Who doesn't know![A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Clearly, you know nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, you got me.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Hardly any shame. There's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
probably things you know I don't.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Probably?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do you want to rephrase that?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh. I think my meaning's clear.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, you smug dastard.[N]
Wanna prove your knowledge?[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Here.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oof! Wha- Did you just throw your axe at me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If everything comes easy to you, then give[N]
it a good swing. Take out that log.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very funny.[A][N][CloseEyes]
You're lucky that didn't hit me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Would it really have been that[N]
terrible a loss?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good talking to you.[A][N]
Why were you asking about[N]
Loile, anyways?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I've forgotten.[N]
Thanks for that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][X]
