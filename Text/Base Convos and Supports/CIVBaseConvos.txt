Ah, Rift! Just who I wished to see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What troubles you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly a trouble. I've been[N]
struck by inspiration.[A][N]
But to fully realize it, I[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Go on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you recall that play[N]

man who struck down his father.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where do I come in?[N]

to achieve.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I meant money, Estelle.[A][N]
