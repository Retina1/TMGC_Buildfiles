You know... I've got it pretty good.[A][N]
Border guarding's hardly a job when[N]
the bandits do the guarding for you.[A][N]
...Hey, it's a living. At least I'm[N]
not a bandit myself.[A] Anything[N]
beats guarding the eastern border.[A][N]
I've heard about Yg'stra.[A][N]
If they come for Mevion, they gotta[N]
get through the east first.[A][N]
Not my problem.[A] And, well, if it[N]
becomes my problem...[A][N]
Well...[N]
Well.[A][X]

##Ch6_MidHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Man... Life's just not going well.[N]
First the bandits... Now this...[A][N]
Oh, a traveler?[A][N]
Care to hear my tale of sorrow?[A][N]
I had finally gotten skilled with the blade,[N]
as to defend myself from these bandits.[A][N]
I felt it would be prudent to pick up[N]
a magical sword, as to keep myself safer.[A][N]
But ever since then... I've felt like my[N]
skills have plateaued.[A] Like this magical[N]
sword isn't making me a better swordsman.[A][N]
Take that to heart, I guess.[A][X]

##Ch6_SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman1]
Are you here to save us from[N]
Amundsen's bandits?[A][N]
Really? Thank you so much![A][N]
Here's a little bit of free advice, then.[N]
His bandits are extremely stupid.[A][N]
That might just sound like an insult,[N]
but it's absolutely true![A][N]
He'll tell some brigands to loot, and then[N]
they'll get distracted by anything![A][N]
Even by some pegasus flying nearby.[A][N]
So, if you wanna serve the people,[N]
start by exploiting the dumb.[A][X]

##Ch6_NorthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid2]
Wow! Are you a real soldier? How cool![N]
Hey, wanna see this cool thing I found?[A][N]
Look! This powder's all white and shiny![N]
You'll never believe where I found it.[A][N]
Me and my friends were playing in the[N]
street, and we found a dark alley...[A][N]
And someone just left this lying around![A][N]
...You seem nice! I'll share some[N]
of it with you. Have a great day![A][X]

##Ch6_SouthVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
You're lookin' mighty scrawny.[A][N]
How're you supposed to not fall over[N]
holding your weapons like that?[A][N]
Well, don't worry. I've got the thing[N]
for that right... here![A][N]
This ring'll bulk you up a bit.[A][N]
Maybe now a stiff breeze won't[N]
topple ya.[A] Oh, be careful, though.[N]
The extra bulk may make you hard to carry.[A][N]
True soldiers are self sufficient, though.[N]
You'll be fine.[A][X]

The mountains or the swamps.[N]
Where would you rather die?[A][N]
Either way, you're gonna[N]
die in pain![A][X]

##C6AmundsenPeggyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
My... You're certainly[N]
something... fetching.[A][N]
A fine hostage,[N]
if nothing else.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
And you still seem to have[N]
two too many eyeballs.[A][N]
Come closer, and I'll fix[N]
that, you pinkly bastard![A][X]

##C6AmundsenButchBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
I recognize those colors...[N]
You're from Mevion![A][N]
Thought we had some unspoken[N]
agreement here![A][N]
We shoo off bordergoers,[N]
you look the other way![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Those days are behind me.[A][N]
You're a dangerous criminal,[N]
AND you're in our way.[A][N]
At least with any luck,[N]
you'll meet a swift end.[A][X]

##C6AmundsenDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
Well... then...[N]
Damn shame... for me...[A][N]
But what other...[N]
choice... was there...?[A][X]

##C6Warning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAmundsen]
This is our last chance![N]
Those Dalstians...[A][N]
They're hurtin' our deal with[N]
the border guards![A][N]
Bandits, raid the villages[N]
while you still can.[A][N]
Meanwhile, some cavalry should[N]
be coming to our aid soon-[A][N]
then there'll truly be no escape.[A][X]

...And if they try coming close to me,[N]
they'll be in for a surprise![A][N]
Hear that, boys? On my leave,[N]
jump out of the ruins![A][X]
