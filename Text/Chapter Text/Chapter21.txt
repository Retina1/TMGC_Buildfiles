Free prisoners[N]

Fort Jraeyan: Interior[X]

Some time later...[X]

##_Ch21SysText
Opening a cell will cause green[N]
units to appear,[A] who'll advance[N]
towards the nearest carpet to escape.[A][N]
They'll spawn the turn after their[N]
cell is opened, not immediately.[A][N]
Green units will be forcibly spawned[N]
in danger if you take too long.[A][N]
There will be warning one turn[N]
before each group is spawned,[A][N]
in the form of the cell's door[N]
being marked with the cursor.[A][N]
You will be rewarded for green unit[N]
survival,[A] with the best reward[N]
if every green unit survives/escapes.[A][N]
Generic green units on their own don't[N]
game over on death,[A] but if[N]
6 or more die, it's game over.[A][N]
Named green units don't cause[N]
a game over on death.[A][N]
To complete the map, open all 6 cells,[A][N]
then escape with your entire army[N]
at any carpets.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I still can't believe it.[A][N]
All those we thought lost[N]
months ago[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a startling coincidence.[N]
In fact, it's more than one.[A][N]
Whoever our current enemy is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They're behind what befell you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd have to agree. Even so, they[N]
were almost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] too weak.[A][N]
They seemed like they were panicking[N]
and trying to tie up loose ends.[A][N]
Why would a group this powerful[N]
act out like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can ponder that later. For now,[N]
I think you should check in.[A][N]
You're their liege.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] will you do?[A][N]
You're not their liege, but[N]
you saved them all the same.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. I don't need thanks.[A][N]
And in any case, I've still got[N]
thoughts to sort through.[A][N]
I'll see if[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If the mercenaries'[N]
belongings have any more clues.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N]

Ah, Zeke! Any ideas?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not at this moment.[A][N]

I feel uneasy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, the way I see it,[N]
we have free reign here.[A][N]
Now that the prisoners are freed,[N]
we can go back inside,[A] and take[N]
all the time we need searching.[A][N]
We'll find something, I'm sure.[A][N]
Whether that's some [OpenQuote]true enemy[CloseQuote] or[N]
proof that this is finally over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That sounds good to me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We should prepared for anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

It's all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quite organized.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Does that paper seem to[N]
hint at any kind of system?[A][N][OpenRight]
Now that you mention it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
There's some letters.[A][N]
See if there's any cabinets or[N]

[OpenQuote]Surveil.[CloseQuote][A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Lots of technical details,[N]
but I can grasp the basics.[A][N]
Seems like something with creating[N]
large artificial eyeballs.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This document's about [OpenQuote]Myrmidon.[CloseQuote][A][N]
Seems like something to do with[N]
magic-bound swordsmen.[A][N]
According to these notes, the project[N]
was scrapped.[A] Seems a subject[N]
went mad and escaped.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There's also a crystal in[N]

that looks like this,[A][N]
it might be valuable evidence.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll get the others.[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe this one.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleInvert]
Today I am on the cusp of excellence.[N]

This is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
my place of study.[A][N]
I've been here for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] 17 years?[A][N]
18 years? Details, really.[A][N]
We've had many a project.[N]
You've probably heard of a few.[A][N]
But there's this great one in[N]
particular.[A] Valkyrie, we called it.[A][N]
You know the Myrmidons, right?[N]
We wanted to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] iterate.[A][N]
Perhaps we were ahead of our time.[A][N]
I've seen that nowadays, they can't[N]
even keep a normal Myrmidon contained.[A][N]
Well, [OpenQuote]normal.[CloseQuote][A][N]
In any case[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Where was I?[A][N]
Something about breaking the[N]
limits of humanity?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I'll just say.[A][N]
Far as I know, this place has had one[N]
purple-haired female named Arin Lirel.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll let you simmer on that.[N]
Big revelation, and all that.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still can't believe the boss.[N]
Why's he ending this whole operation?[A][N]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] had a good thing going.[N]
All the secrets we could want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you finished moping?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose so. Better to destroy and[N]
uncover again,[A] than to let the[N]
secrets of the world slip free.[A][N]
Speaking of destroy, I suppose it's[N]
time to clean up our subjects.[A][N]
Just gotta get-[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight]
Sir! Enemies have entered the fort![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can't be.[A][N]
The boss had all those mercs[N]
killed![A] And he's already[N]
left for Dalst again![A][N]
What in the hell is he doing?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What shall I do?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know! This isn't my wheelhouse![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll lend a hand. You're clearly hopeless.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you insist. Sortie everyone we have.[N]
Get executioners towards the cells.[A][N]
Do everything in your power to kill[N]
those who approach.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I expect[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ample compensation.[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure, sure. Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft][LoadPtolemy]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you hear something?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's probably[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry for dragging you into this.[A][N]
Spending your last days in a cell[N]
all for showing kindness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] talk like that.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hopeful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'd even bid the headsman[N]
a good day, I'm sure.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] To die here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Never[N]
again seeing Aercolyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's dark in here. But I think[N]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] cells?[A][N]
No clue who they'd be keeping[N]
prisoner here,[A] but their[N]
enemy is our ally.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I ag[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]ree[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's dim[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But I can see into[N]
that cell there.[A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that outfit is unmistakable.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't follow.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone! Prepare to move out![N]
Leave no cell unopened![A][N]
Today, we liberate our proud[N]
soldiers of Aercolyn![A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter how many times I[N]
come up here, it's amazing.[A][N]
The whole world's down there.[A][N]
But now's hardly the time for that.[A][N]
I came up here for a clear space[N]
to think.[A] Something must be[N]
done about Sinclair.[A][N]
I know not what posessed that fool,[N]
but his shortsightedness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's going to bring an end to[N]
us all.[A] He's too dangerous to[N]
be left in his current position.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I figured I'd find you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Tarquin. You're a lucky man.[N]
You don't have to handle this.[A][N]
Though, humor me. What would you[N]
do with Aercolyn's lord?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He threatens the law of this land.[N]
I'd strip him of everything.[A][N]
And then, send him on his way.[N]
It's harsh, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Extreme measures for the good of all.[N]
I understand your viewpoint.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe that's what we do, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What of his daughter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]She's got a life ahead to[N]
prove her worth to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've got an idea. Once I'm[N]
back in Arbordia,[A] I'll draft[N]
up a sentencing.[A][N]
This world's a changing and chaotic[N]
place. We must stand firm.[A][N]
Stand for what'll keep us thriving[N]
tomorrow.[A][X]
