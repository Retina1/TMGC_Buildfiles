[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello, Lady Blair.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Evening, Sam. I must say, you've[N]
matured a lot, recently.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You might not think it, but I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
All of us, really[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We can tell you're growing more[N]
confident in yourself.[A][N]
It's slow, for sure, but it's[N]
growth nonetheless.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've hardly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. Eventually, I'm sure[N]
you'll realize your potential.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]M-maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I have grown.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Greetings, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello, Sir Hyperius![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for the sir. You're leading me.[N]
But, I feel like I say this a lot.[A][N]
I am but a humble public servant.[N]
A title is of little concern to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But you've done[N]
enough to earn that title.[A][N]
You deserve the honor that[N]
comes with it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. On an unrelated note,[N]
what do you think of His Highness?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Prince Zeke? He's a reliable ally.[N]
I'm glad to have him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A respectable opinion.[A][N]
I can tell he's pleased to have[N]
a companion of his age.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is it? You[N]
trailed off a bit.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nothing of import.[N]
I'm just reflecting.[A][N]
Keep yourself well, young lady.[A][X]

##I6JosefConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Evening, milady! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm well. What about you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've been quite great! It's always[N]
a pleasure to ward off scum.[A][N]
Their riches shall serve a grander[N]
purpose, of keeping us supplied.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't it a little ironic[N]
to steal from bandits?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose you're not wrong.[A][N]
But gold does nothing for a corpse,[N]
and everything for a living man.[A][N]
And unfortunately, it's somewhat[N]
impractical to return this gold.[A][N]
No real way to find its [OpenQuote]rightful[N]
owner[CloseQuote] anymore.[A] So the next best[N]
thing is us using it,[A][N]
as to invest in our army and[N]
keep more people protected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair enough. You seem to[N]
have this all figured out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hate wasting anything. Time,[N]
resources, lives[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm driven to get the most out[N]
of everything I can.[A][X]
##I6JosefSpecialConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Evening, milady! I have[N]
something to ask of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What is it, Josef?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've just been thinking about[N]
that kid[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hilbert.[A][N]
He's a sweet young man, and[N]
I think he looks up to me.[A][N]
I want to keep him safe,[N]
but I'm not sure what more to do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He's an anima mage[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
So he'd struggle against elder magic.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Opistinian magic's good against[N]
that, right?[A] I think I have[N]
an idea.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That it is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sure you[N]
could ask someone to-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Teach me light magic! You're[N]
truly something, milady.[A][N]
I'm sure he'd be glad to[N]
hear of this.[A][N]
I'll go find someone. On behalf[N]
of both me and Hilbert, I thank you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was going to say a light[N]
mage could fight alongside you.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though, an armored knight using[N]
magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That could be interesting.[A][X]

Again, I must thank you, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am just fulfilling His vision.[N]
No need to thank me, young lady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So, Opistus guided you to us?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thank you, Opistus.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The road ahead is a harsh one,[N]
and He wishes to guide us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I must say, though. How'd[N]
you catch up with us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course. One of Opistinia's[N]
wyvern guards deliverred me unto you.[A][N]
I would've taken Wendell, but he's[N]
been under the weather as of late.[A][N]
Once he's feeling better, perhaps[N]
he can be of assistance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wendell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My beloved wyvern, Wendell.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I didn't think of you as[N]
the type to have a wyvern.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I guess it's not[N]
too surprising.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Understandable. I've been well.[N]
Stopping here was a great move.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, I'm sure we'll[N]
talk again soon enough,[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm curious. How does it[N]
feel, returning to Holanis?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must admit, it's not quite[N]
what I expected I'd be doing.[A][N]
Though do remember that we're[N]
in western Holanis,[A] and I[N]
lived more in the east.[A][N]
So it's bound to feel different.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. True.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'll be interesting seeing[N]
more of the country, at least.[A][N]
Though it stings a bit not getting[N]
a chance to see my home longer.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You don't have to feel bad. It's[N]
my choice to be here,[A] and I know[N]
I'd be unsatisfied staying behind.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I still wonder.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think your concern over[N]
this is proof enough.[A][N]
That you'd be a worthy prince.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I won't pry. If you wish, we[N]
can have someone escort you away.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nah. I probably should[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Not their memories. Which[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that's[N]
odd, right?[A] Knowing magic without[N]
having the years of training?[A][N]
It's instinctual, I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How bizarre. What can[N]
you do as yourself?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A great many things, none of which[N]
I have interest in.[A][N]

What an honor. I've been well.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't say the same of my glasses.[A][N]
Blasted things keep sooting up.[N]

That's unfortunate. And I'd imagine[N]

Unless you want me to be worthless[N]

Just my sketchbook. There's a lot[N]

That makes sense. And I guess the ashen[N]

Ha. I guess you're right. Though,[N]
I've got some colored implements.[A][N]
So I wouldn't mind some splashes[N]

Fair enough. If you change your[N]

I've nothing else going on.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Might've already hunted us enough[N]

Nothing iumportant, Blair. It's just[N]

I know so little about.[A][N]
A nation in shambles it may be[N]

The closest thing to an army Holanis[N]
should have is in Gohranos,[A] and it's[N]
hardly enough to support an invasion.[A][N]
Many of those at the archives were[N]
mercenary in nature.[A] Technically, you[N]
could argue all Gohranians are mercenary,[A][N]
but in this case, most of those at the[N]
archives were not familiar to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What does that mean? Is someone[N]
funding these mercenaries?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If only I knew. Gohranos should hardly[N]
have the coin for this kind of manpower.[A][N]
Perhaps there's another faction behind[N]
the scenes, setting this all up.[A][N]
But I've seen nothing of that in[N]
Gohranos.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can probably just continue[N]
our route as planned.[A][N]
The landmarks that're recorded[N]
in the Archives.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd agree. Of the three, I've only ever been to[N]
the Aqueduct, and only in passing.[A][N]
Can't say anything for sure of[N]
what actually happens there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, Artemis.[N]
This helped a lot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Any time. I'd rather not fight for[N]
a Holanis borne of the shadows.[A][X]

##I6ToddsworthConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadToddsworth][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, milady. Perfect timing![N]
I had the grandest of ideas![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it, Toddsworth?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To bolster army morale, I thought[N]
perhaps I could regale us with a song.[A][N]
A perfect ballad came to me in a vision![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What kind of vision?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You see, I found some absolutely[N]
delectable berries,[A] and when I[N]
ate them,[A] the gods themselves came[N]
unto me.[A] They called me their most[N]
turpid vessel,[A] and spoke to me a[N]
song beyond mortal ken.[A][N]
And then, I woke up and found a stream[N]
of blood coming from my ears.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're fine now.[A][N]
Anyway, shall I?[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Lady Blair! How fare you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm alright, Stefan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! A quick question,[N]
if you'll be so kind.[A][N]
I've been meaning to get[N]
in some sparring.[A][N]
Specifically, some practice[N]
against other swordsmen.[A][N]
I'm wondering if there's anyone[N]
in particular you wish me spar.[A][N]
I'd imagine I'll grow differently[N]
based on my opponent, after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd trust your judgement,[N]
but if you insist,[A][N]
I can pick for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, milady. Pick whoever[N]
you feel would suit me best.[A][X]
##I6StefanArinConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Arin?[N]
She's exceptionally skilled.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]
To you as well. You're quite[N]

##I6StefanButchConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Butch?[N]
He'd make a formidable opponent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadButch][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ayup. I see omeone wants the ol'[N]

Let's see if you can impress.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, sir! I'll show[N]
you a fight![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Then have at it![A][X]
##I6StefanJeffConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Jeff?[A][N]
I'm sure you could learn something[N]
from his evasive style.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadJeff][OpenMidLeft]
Well met-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, kid. I don't do sparring.[N]
But I suppose I can show you something.[A][N]
See this, here? It's a lockpick.[A][N]
In 20 minutes, it'll be a[N]
golden key for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A key to success![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, just a key to some[N]
sucker's prized riches.[A][X]
##I6StefanFlynnConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Flynn?[N]
I think he'd enjoy it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadFlynn][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

He's an absolute powerhouse.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You wish for a challenge?[N]
This takes me back to my youth[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Know that I won't go easy[N]
on you, young one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate that, sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

##I6StefanLeilaConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How about Leila?[A][N]
She's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unconventional, for sure.[N]
But I'm sure you can learn from her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. Thank you, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadLeila][OpenMidLeft]
Well met![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's get this over with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't be shy! I've seen[N]
your skill, milady![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's great.[A][X]
##I6StefanSoloConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't think there's[N]
anyone left to spar with.[A][N]
Arin's in no shape to fight,[N]
and everyone else is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Ah. My apologies. I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] tie[N]
a sword to a training dummy.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, nothing for it, I guess.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Hyah! Hah![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's this unfamiliar feeling?[N]
Is this some blessing?[A][N][CloseEyes]
Whatever it is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I feel empowered.[N]

##I6EmileConvo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Ah, Blair. Good to see you.[N]
I'd wanted to ask an opinion.[A][N]
I felt since we had time, I should[N]
make use of it by studying.[A][N]
The question is, what exactly[N]
do I put my time towards?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What're your options, Emile?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I could further[N]
my mastery of anima magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I could ask some of our army's more[N]
devoted the basics of Opistinian magic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's not my forte, but I could try to[N]
understand elder magics[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Or, I could craft some staves. Won't[N]
really make me better at using them,[A][N]
but I find it relaxing.[A][N]
I'll do whatever you think best.[A][X]
##I6EmileConvoAnima
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd stick with what you're[N]
best at, Emile.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Anima magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
On that note[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I think I have a strong tome somewhere.[N]
That'll be good for practice.[A][N]
Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]
##I6EmileConvoLight
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Light magic sounds like[N]
it could be helpful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Light magic? Sounds good to me.[N]
It'll cover anima's weakness nicely.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for checking in, Blair.[A][X]
##I6EmileConvoDark
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know it's not your favorite,[N]
but dark magic may help us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dark magic? Understandable.[N]
It's always good to push oneself.[A][N]
I'll ask around for a practice tome.[N]

##I6EmileConvoStaves

You know, when you're not constantly[N]
being attacked by bandits,[A][N]
the Lowlands are surprisingly nice.[A][N]
There's a beauty within the ashes.[N]
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad to be away from Mevion.[N]
It's nice, of course.[A][N]

Not a problem at all, Avan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

If you're interested.[A][N]

How hard could it be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Can't do one damned thing without[N]
getting soot in every orifice.[A][N]

Nobody would fault you if you[N]

Feel free to take respite from[N]
the ash.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nah. It's fine. Besides, it's[N]
a rather remarkable view here.[A][N]
The moonlight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] How it reflects off[N]
the ashen dusts[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's nice.[A][N][CloseEyes]

Well, yes it is! Your blonde friend[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Natasia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] She taught me a thing or two.[A][N]
Turns out swinging an axe is some[N]
good stress relief![A][N]
Plus, we need the firewood anyway.[N]
It's pretty swell all around.[A][N]
Maybe I'll teach her the basics[N]
of staffing sometime.[A][N]
I told her I wouldn't teach her[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I could learn to teach.[A][N]
Probably.[A] Anyway, keep well,[N]

I think we all needed a break.[A][N]

there's a certain[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] quaintness.[A][N]
I'm not sure how much longer we[N]

That sounds fine to me.[N]
From here, we're near the Aqueduct.[A][N]

he can surely hold it together against[N]

And I can say the same of Lord Neillstrom.[A][N]
