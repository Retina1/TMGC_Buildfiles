[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadRachael][OpenRight][LoadCassius][OpenFarRight]
Alright, we're nearly there.[N]
Just past here, and...[A][N]
Ah. Well then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you see?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We've got a problem. The castle's[N]
under attack.[A] Seems the bandits[N]
are making a move.[A][N][OpenRight]
...Wait. I think I hear something.[N]
...Cavalry.[A] Bandits don't have[N]
horses, now do they?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Wait... Let me check.[A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
...This isn't good.[A][N][OpenRight]
Is it Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
It appears to be.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
I think I can also make out[N]
some knights and the king.[A][N]
They're holding the castle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's both Yg'stra and bandits,[N]
they can't hold out forever.[A][N]
We have to help them![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. I say one of the three[N]
of us make for the king.[A][N]
Talk to him, let us know our status,[N]
and make a move from there.[A][N][OpenRight]
Whatever the plan is, we'd better[N]
move.[A] I doubt whoever's here is[N]
the last Yg'stra'll send.[A][N]
...Also, is it just me, or have[N]
rations been... disappearing?[A][N]
I know, I know, not the time.[N]
But have a look sometime, aight?[A][X]

##Ch7_Emile_Spawn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile]
Well... What's this?[N]
A battle? Unfortunate.[A][N]
Maybe that's a sign it's time[N]
to return to Dalst.[A][N]
I should be able to get some[N]
results out of this research.[A][N]
...If nothing else, Blair may[N]
find them interesting.[A][X]

##Ch7_Emile_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
Emile? Is that you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Blair?! What are you doing here,[N]
all the way in Elba Cor?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's... a funny story. I'll explain later.[N]
What about you?[A] Last I saw you, you'd[N]
mentioned some kind of field research.[A][N]
Would this be it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, yes. I had been traveling near Elba Cor[N]
to study their ancient Reblow staves.[A][N]
But then I might've gotten ever-so[N]
slightly sidetracked.[A] You'd understand.[N]
There was this... strong presence.[A][N]
A flux in the energies within our[N]
anima magic.[A] So, I had ended up[N]
making a deal with some locals.[A][N]
Slept on the floor for a few nights[N]
for easy access to it.[A][N]
I was about to go out and gather some[N]
more readings, when I saw... this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Interesting... You'll have to tell me[N]
all about it after the battle.[A][N]
Keep yourself safe, alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you not expect me to fight[N]
with you?[A] I may be your tutor,[N]
but I also consider you a dear friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sure about this? I wouldn't[N]
want anything happening to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've known me for years, now.[N]
I'll keep myself safe.[A][N]
Besides, whatever journey you're on will surely[N]
make for some great research inspiration.[A][X]

##Ch7_NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
If I'm not mistaken, that young girl[N]
defending the bridge is named Alexis.[A][N]
It's always great to see our youth[N]
eager to stand up for their nation.[A][N]
In fact, I hear her vigor is so great[N]
that she can... How do I put this?[A][N]
She can exploit advantages over her foes'[N]
weapons way more than any other recruit.[A][N]
It's almost as if she moves twice[N]
as fast when taking down lance users.[A][N]
I can't imagine how formidable she'd be[N]
if she had more than just an axe.[A][N]
...We're in good hands, that's for sure.[A][X]

##Ch7_Mid1House
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Don't tell anyone, but I think I saw[N]
some Yg'strans hiding across the river.[A][N]
They'll probably spring up once they[N]
notice you've found the king.[A][N]
After all, they'll want a two-for-one[N]
special on enemy commanders.[A][N]
Pretty sure it was a creepy looking[N]
guy with a ridiculous mustache,[A][N]
as well as some archers with[N]
exceptionally long bows.[A][N]
Again, you didn't hear this from me.[A][X]

##Ch7_Mid2House
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
What an interesting young man that was.[A][N]
...Should I be concerned about what he[N]
was saying?[A] Something about a flux?[N]
...I'm sure it's nothing.[A][N]
Besides, if a roaring battle and bandits[N]
won't scare me out of this house,[A][N]
nothing ever will.[A][X]

##Ch7_SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman4][CloseEyes]
...Quiet. I think I hear something.[A][N]
...The sounds of hooves to the south[N]
and to the east.[A][N]
...Wings beating from the mountains.[N]
...Brigands chortling to the west.[A][N]
...And even louder hooves further east.[A][N][OpenEyes]
What, you CAN'T hear those sounds?[N]
Shame. At least I feel special now.[A][X]

##BrandlBlairTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl][OpenMidLeft]
Excuse me! Would you happen[N]
to be His Majesty?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose I would be. You must[N]
be Blair, are you not?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to see you well.[N]
We've much to discuss.[A][N]
But first... We must bring[N]
this battle to a close.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How so?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, then. I'll make you proud![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...That energy and optimism...[N]
Almost reminds me of him.[A][N]
I believe... I've made the right choice.[A][X]

##BrandlRachaelTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRachael][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl][OpenMidLeft]
Your Majesty![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Back already, Rachael?[N]
Tell me, how did it go?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We've located Blair, and she's[N]
willing to talk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent news. Now, before that,[N]
we must bring an end to this battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What are your orders, then?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Understood. I shall see[N]
your will done.[A][X]

##BrandlCassiusTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl]
Hey! King![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm surprised you're still in one piece,[N]
Cassius. Tell me, how did it go?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]The young lady's been found.[N]
She's with us now.[A][N]
Course, this ain't the time to[N]
sip tea and discuss politics.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We must bring an end[N]
to this skirmish.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the plan for that?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well. I won't[N]
disappoint ya'.[A][X]

##Ch7_Zaine_Spawn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Well, they've converged.[N]
That's not ideal.[A][N]
...No matter. We can fell[N]
them all at once.[A][N]
Archers, cover me. We'll[N]
wait for them to approach.[A][X]

##C7ZaineBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Don't think you've won[N]
just yet.[A] After all,[N]
you need to get through me.[A][X]

##C7ZaineEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
An anima user?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Judging by that, I suppose[N]
you'd not want academic parley.[A][N]
Unfortunate. Elder magics are[N]
a breed I'm unfamiliar with.[A][N]
Still, I'm sure I'll prevail.[N]
Maybe learn a thing or two.[A][X]

##C7ZaineKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Aha! An enemy dark mage.[N]
Time to prove my dominance![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I can tell from your eyes.[A][N]
You lack knowledge.[N]
You lack power.[A][N]
I'll show you how a real[N]
elder scholar fights.[A][X]

##C7ZaineDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Well... then...[N]
Glory to... Yg'stra...[A][X]

##C7BrandlDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl]
So... this is it...[N]
I'm sorry, everyone...[A][N]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]...But now... I can see...[N]
him again...[A][X]

##C7HyperiusDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Urgh...! Your majesty,[N]
my sincerest apologies.[A][N]
I must retreat... so I can[N]
live to serve another day.[A][X]

##C7AlexisDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis]
Oof! That was... quite painful.[N]
Sorry, everyone.[A][N]
I can't die like this.[A][X]

##C7WilhelmDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadWilhelm]
Ooh... That's gonna be sore[N]
as hell tomorrow.[A][N]
Welp, I'm packing up.[N]
Sorry, guys.[A][X]

##C7WilhelmAlexisTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis][OpenMidLeft]
So, you're the new recruit.[N]
What a day to join, I guess.[A][N]
The name's Wilhelm.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Sir! I am Alexis, honored[N]
to serve Elba Cor![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Geez, no need to blow my eardrums out.[N]
...Wonder how long that vigor'll last.[A][N]
I was like that once...[N]
But things just fade.[A][N]
So it goes, I guess.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Were you saying something, sir?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's nothing.[A] ...They're coming,[N]
and fast. Eyes up.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]We'll show them a thing or two![A][N][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]...And there she goes.[A][N]
Maybe once this whole thing is over,[N]
I'll hit the gambling halls again.[A][N]
That's what I need right now.[A][X]
