[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][ToggleSmile]
That's the last settlement.[A][N]
They're all on board with us.[N]
Good work, everyone![A][X]
##Tale2Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Impressively done, Your Highness.[A][N]
[...]I suppose the end of that title[N]
might at last be nigh.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps. My discussions have[...][N]
borne much fruit, one may say.[A][N]
There's fear, of course. Fear of[N]
an unknown structure,[A] and of[N]
responsibility's burdens.[A][N]
But there's also a hope for a[N]
brighter future.[A][N]
[...]From what I've gathered, there[N]
wasn't much hope for many years.[A][N]
The years that you all thought[N]
that I was dead.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The king's despair was[...][N]
Well, it was what you'd think.[A][N]
And that bled into how he led.[N]
[...]Or, some may say, how he didn't.[A][N]
The weakness of the crown's part of[N]
how banditry got so bad here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I never knew you felt that way.[A][N]
But that's what today[...] What all[N]
I've done is for.[A][N]
It's for giving power to the people[N]
of the land.[A] For laying groundwork[N]
to a equitable future.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Let us hope it will all be[N]
worth it, Zeke.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It will. I swear, Hyperius.[A][N]
[...]We ought to return to Father.[N]
We've done well today.[A][X]

##Tale2Opening1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBrandl][OpenLeft][LoadZeke]
[...]I believe we're about[N]
to depart, Father.[A][N]
Keep yourself well.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course, my son. I only hope[N]
they will listen to you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
We're bringing the people of Elba Cor[N]
the hope to rule for themselves.[A][N]
While it may be a new idea for[N]
them,[A] I believe that they will[N]
embrace it gladly in time.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
I believe our route passes by a[N]
half-dozen or so settlements.[A][N]
Hardly much in the grand scheme,[A][N]
but the prince wishes to ensure[N]
this is the people's desire.[A][N][OpenLeft]
There'd be a certain irony in the[N]
crown declaring a freer government.[A][N]
Besides, I've[...] little to truly show[N]
for this land.[A] I owe it to this[N]
country to show some goodwill.[A][N][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadCassius]
We're prepared, Zeke. Royal knights[N]
and[...] not royal knights alike.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Be safe, Zeke.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course, Father. We shall[N]
return with great news, I hope.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[...]If this is where the Courian lineage[N]
ends, I can rest content.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Make me proud, son.[A][X]
##Tale2Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLeila][OpenLeft][LoadJeff][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Still can't believe how[N]
soft you've gotten, Jeff.[A][N]
Where's the hate? The spite?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Wherever I can't find it.[A][N]
Have you ever tried simply[N]
being happy?[A] I mean, it's[N]
not THAT simple.[A][N]
But seeing the good in the[N]
world goes a damn long way.[A][N]
[...]Why are you here anyway?[N]
Thought you hated Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadRachael]
I believe she still thinks[N]
she has business with me.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Don't think you can make[N]
me spill any of this.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Right.[A][N][OpenRight]
Trust me. Ignoring her is[N]
easier in the long run.[A][N]
[...]How's your new training[N]
been going?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Staves? Surprisingly well.[A][N]
Wouldn't think a rat like[N]
me'd make good use of them,[A][N]
but they're coming naturally.[A][N][OpenRight]
Good to hear.[A] [...]You're on healing[N]
duty today.[A] Couldn't get any of[N]
our sages to come along.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
[...]Real trial by fire here.[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCassius]
You'll keep us alive, bud.[A][N]
I'm sure of it.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadArtemis]
Indeed. I have faith.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
For the love of[...] They roped[N]
you into this, too?[A][N][OpenRight]
I wouldn't say roped. I felt I[N]
owed it to the prince,[A] after[N]
all he did for Holanis.[A][N]
And for all he plans to do after[N]
his eventual abdication.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Gettin' on his good side early?[N]
Clever girl.[A][N][OpenRight]
Make of it what you wish.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadZeke]
Everyone! We're nearing our[N]
destination. Be on your guard.[A][X]
##Tale2Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenLeft][LoadZeke]
Banditry. Of course.[N]
Couldn't be anything else.[A][N]
[...]They do seem a bit more well[N]
off than the usual bandit, though.[A][N]
[...]I wonder if they're scavenged[N]
off of Dalst's remnants[...][A][N]
In any case, this'll be a chance[N]
to let our actions speak for us.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course, Your Highness.[A][N]
Everybody! Fan out and bring[N]
an end to these ruffians![A][N]
Don't let them harm a hair[N]
on the citizenry's head![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
If I may, it appears that some[N]
of our targets are in[...][A][N]
Well, hard to reach locations.[A][N]
I shall assist you best as I[N]
can. Leila[...] might, too.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Excellent. [...]As one, knights![N]
We've fought much worse![A][N]
Today, we show the people of our[N]
land a might to be proud of![A][X]

this country if we can't do this?[A][N]
The other settlements won't want to[N]

[...]Not that I can blame them.[A][N]

meant to fade after all.[A][X]

##Tale2Village1Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
[...]Yup, you're the prince.[A][N]
A good once-over's tellin'[N]
me you're genuine.[A][N]
Pleasure to have you.[A][N]
I believe our meetin' hall[N]
is right over[...] there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, good sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Huh. Never thought a prince'd[N]
thank a man like me.[A][N]
[...]Nice.[A][X]
##Tale2Village1Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Who're you supposed to be?[A][N]
We got word that the prince was[N]
supposed to come see us.[A][N]
And your hair's not lookin'[N]
pink in the slightest.[A][N]
I can't say for sure if you're[N]
really with him, is all.[A][X]

##Tale2Village2Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6]
The prince arrives! What a joyous[N]
day for our humble settlement![A][N]
Please, do follow me.[A][N]
We'll keep business brief as[N]
possible,[A] but we're simply[N]
delighted to have your company![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] glad.[A][X]
##Tale2Village2Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan6]
Is the prince sending a mere[N]
knight out to see us?[A][N]
Rubbish! Rubbish, I say![A][N]
Get me the man himself,[N]
and I'll listen.[A][N]
Until then, I have to ask[N]
you to leave us alone.[A][X]

##Tale2Village3Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
That's the fanciest armor[N]
I've ever seen, young man.[A][N]
Wait[...] Are you Prince Zeke?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That I am. I believe your village[N]
recieved my correspondence.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That we did. Come, come. I hear[N]
you've much to discuss today.[A][N]
Make yourself at home.[A][X]
##Tale2Village3Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
Hm[...] Are you really Zeke?[N]
I can't be too sure[...][A][N]
What if it's all some bandit[N]
trick?[A] Maybe if you had[N]
some regal armor,[A][N]
I'd believe you.[A][X]

##Tale2Village4Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier3]
Prince Zeke! I've heard you were[N]
coming today![A] Right this way.[N]
You're our guest of honor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I hardly need any of that stature,[N]
but I appreciate the gesture.[A][N]
Today, we shall discuss our various[N]
futures and designs for Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That's lovely. I'm not who[N]
you need to convince, though.[A][N]
[...]As I said. Right this way.[A][X]
##Tale2Village4Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier3]
I've been told to keep outsiders[N]
out. Makes sense, really.[A][N]
Unless you're the crown, I won't[N]
bend for anyone.[A][N]
[...]Please leave.[A][X]

##Tale2Village5Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
Hmph. You sent the big man himself.[A][N]
Not bad at all, Prince Zeke.[A][N]
Perhaps we can come to an agreement[N]
on your proposal after all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It would be my pleasure.[N]
Now, let us negotiate.[A][X]
##Tale2Village5Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan3]
Hmph. I know your game.[A][N]
Send a delegate to meet us so you[N]
don't feel bad screwin' us.[A][N]
Well, I won't fall for it.[A][N]
If you want our support, I'll only[N]
accept the legitimate article.[A][N]
Bring the prince to the table,[N]
and we'll negotiate.[A][X]

##Tale2Village6Zeke
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadKid2]
My parents told me not to talk[N]
to strangers[...][A] Well, unless[N]
they're royalty.[A][N]
Then they're fine with it.[A][N]
[...]Wait[...] Are you Mister Prince[N]
Zeke? Woah! That's so cool![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That[...] would be me.[A][N]
Might I speak with your[N]
leader, please?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing! Right this way![A][X]
##Tale2Village6Other
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadKid2]
My parents told me not to talk[N]
to strangers[...][A] Well, unless[N]
they're royalty.[A][N]
Then they're fine with it.[A][N]
[...]You don't look very royal,[N]
so I should probably go.[A][X]

##Tale2InfinitesComing
[OpenMidRight][LoadRachael]
Your Highness! I see numerous[N]
bandits to the east![A][N]
We must complete our task and[N]
secure the citizenry with haste![A][X]

##Tale2WrongVisitor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
Did those villagers turn us away?[A][N]
[...]Guess they might only listen if[N]
their prince shows up.[A][N]
[...]They're sure not making this easy,[A][N]
but I'll gladly put in the work to show[N]
them that my mission is just and true.[A][X]
