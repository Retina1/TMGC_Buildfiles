home to, Mister Dean.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This might be wrong of me to say,[N]
but you two are family to me too.[A][N]
We've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been through hell together.[N]
And that's nothing of the ones lost.[A][N]
But on my life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You two will[N]
survive. You must.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right back at you, Dean.[N]
You're not dying on us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll make it out of here, and then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, you can introduce us to your kids![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I like the sound of that.[N]
But first, the battle awaits.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That I am. Today, I shall reach[N]
for the heavens,[A] and channel[N]
their wrath.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Does that actually mean anything?[N]
Just say you'll fight real good.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How naive. Just because we're in[N]
a hellish conflict[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That means not that I can neglect[N]
honing my linguistic flair.[A][N]
If the oral tradition dies, so[N]
too does what makes us human.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] let 'er do it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Shall we proceed to the battlefield,[N]
instead of critiquing my tongue?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yes. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Never phrase it[N]
like that again.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I promise nothing, comrade.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you two are done, then.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We move, now![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftRose
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ready to fry, boss.[N]
Let me at 'em![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Fry, you say. You're a scary kid.[A][N]
A funny kid, no doubt. But a[N]
very scary kid.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't patronize me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Wouldn't dream of it.[N]
You're impressive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Make sure to keep 'er safe, Rift.[N]
Couldn't stand if she fell now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all too well the fate[N]
of the others.[A] And none[N]
of us shall meet that fate.[A][N]
Not while I'm still around.[A][N][OpenRight]
They won't even get close to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alrighty. I trust ya two.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftDirk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]At the very least, I am.[A][N]
If he must grieve, so be it.[N]
I shall fight his share.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be fine.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you insist.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry, kid. I know there's[N]
nothin' I could've done.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I still feel I let[N]
ya down.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hardly your fault.[A][N][OpenRight]
We shall punish those at fault.[N]
They will pay for what they've taken.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That they shall.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards, lads.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ready and willing.[N]
As is Rift, I'm sure.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You wanna make this[N]
a challenge, Callum?[A][N]
See who bags more foes?[A][N][OpenRight]
That's every battle for me.[N]
Competition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just remember what we're[N]
'ere for. Duty. Not glory.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
There's a glory in duty.[A][N]
But I see your meaning.[N]
I'll restrain myself.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Like hell I will.[N]
I live for glory.[A][N]
Not to say I won't help[N]
you if needed.[A][N]
But I won't hold myself[N]
back in any way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair 'nough.[A][N]
It'd be rude to try and[N]
mute part o' ya.[A][N]
Just be careful.[A][N][OpenRight]
No need. I'll be victorious.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. If I'm not ready[N]
to fight,[A] then what in the[N]
hell is the point of my life?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hadn't you fought alongside us[N]
to find a new point?[A][N]
Seems like not much has changed.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Hey. Protecting people's far more[N]
purposeful than arena stuff.[A][N]
Saving lives instead of turning[N]
them into a cheap thrill.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even if I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] couldn't[N]
save anyone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't blame yerself, lad.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wilhelm wouldn't stand[N]
for me moping around.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's why I'll fight[N]
for their names.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah. Me too.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ready, then? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Eh. We'll see.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's all?[N]
We'll see?[A][N]
We've been through hell[N]
and back, Wilhelm.[A][N]
Now's the time to be[N]
decisive.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I were truly decisive,[N]
I'd decisively doubt our odds.[A][N]
Not to downplay us, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Things're bad.[A] To put it[N]
very lightly.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Have at least some faith.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I get the apprehension, lad.[N]
But that'll just ensure our end.[A][N]
Strike wit' at least a bit o'[N]
confidence.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not like I'm not[N]
used to deathmarches.[A][N][OpenRight]
Good thing this won't be one.[A][N]
It's a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] livingmarch.[N]
I guess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Focus on fightin', lad.[N]
Being funny ain't your thing.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRiftArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I am ready to give my[N]
life for our cause.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No you're not. Not gonna let[N]
you just die like that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you're not. Well, then.[A][N]
Guess I'll just have to keep[N]
up with you.[A] Can't slow you[N]
down when you're like this.[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't say this to many people,[N]
but you're damned strong.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll have no issue[N]
staying alive.[A] As long as[N]
you will it, that is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The lad's right. Don't ever[N]
stop fightin', Argent.[A][N]
We'd be nowhere fast without[N]
your skill and mind.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. As long as I[N]
live, I'll never yield.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then let's get on with it.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course, boss. Ready[N]
to shred and tear.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleRose
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
I was born ready.[A][N]
Fifteen years ago, I was[N]
made for this moment.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Two decades in the making[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I shall show this barren[N]
land what I can do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hold up. I'm older than[N]
the both of you combined?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn.[A][N][OpenRight]
Don't worry, old man.[N]
You're still great.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Indeed. You've many years of[N]
experience beyond us.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Please, show us what you're[N]
capable of tonight.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can do that.[A][N]
Try to keep up, youngsters![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleDirk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
I am. I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] shall soar.[A][N]
Sweep across this barren land,[N]
setting the night ablaze[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I shall deliver oblivion unto[N]
the forces of darkness.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Guess I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ready too.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to hear.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] never thought it'd[N]
come down to this.[A][N]
Poor kid[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've known 'em[N]
so long.[A][N]
For this to 'appen[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'll make 'em proud.[A][N][OpenRight]
We all shall, boss.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We must.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're of one mind, then.[N]
I suppose nothin' left to it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards, you two![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadCallum][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Damn straight.[A][N][OpenRight]
Passionate, I see.[A][N]
Channel that passion, comrade.[N]
Let it be your strength![A][N][OpenFarRight]
I don't need that. The strength[N]
I've got now is fine.[A][N]
My own power'll never betray me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's the one good thing my[N]
commander ever taught me.[A][N]
The power behind power.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Believe what you wish, lad.[N]
Just make sure you live.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry. I'll be fine.[N]
Again, I've got power.[A][N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] all I need.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even if you deny it,[N]
your passion will shine.[A][N]
As will ours, boss.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let us fly.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As I ever shall be.[A][N]
Life doesn't give us the luxury[N]
of a rehearsal,[A] but I trust[N]
that we'll make it through this.[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed. All we can do is[N]
believe in our instincts.[A][N]
Not what I'm normally apt[N]
to do, but, hey.[A][N]
This has been a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] new[N]
experience, in many ways.[A][N]
Some good. Many bad.[N]
What's one more change?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You adapt well, bud.[A][N]
I'll see that you both[N]
make it outta this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And we'll see to your survival[N]
too, leader.[A] Today, we'll[N]
triumph after so long.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ready whenever you are.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing. Let's do this![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
That I am. It's time for my[N]
grand ascendancy.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's a little dramatic.[A][N]
But I suppose after what we've[N]
been through, it's warranted.[A][N]
We've all broken a bit.[A][N][OpenRight]
Exactly.[A] And today, we[N]
shall reclaim ourselves.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Doubt it'll be anythin' that[N]
deep.[A] But if it gets you[N]
through today[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Fine by me.[A][N][OpenRight]
We're devoid of purpose.[A][N]
And thus, I must ascribe unto[N]
us a newer purpose.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whatever you say.[A][N]
Just tell me who and[N]
when to spear, boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing, lad.[N]
Well, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Charge![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanEstelleArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
I am ready to atone for[N]
my life's many errors.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Be it through falling[N]
in protecting you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
'Twould rather you live on[N]
to fight alongside us.[A][N]
Atoning in death is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a trite thing.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Trite?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Make your own choices, but know[N]
that living is the greatest one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The girl's right. You're a boon[N]
to us long as you're alive.[A][N]
I don't think yer errors are[N]
worth dyin' for.[A][N]
And even if you do, it's better[N]
to live an' correct them.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. I'll fight for[N]
their legacy until I die.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to 'ear.[A][N]
All ready, then?[N]

It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I must be.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm ready as I can be, boss![A][N]
Point me at 'em and I'll[N]
shoot 'em down![A][N]
I'll take revenge for the[N]
three of us![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Remember. Today is not just[N]
about revenge.[A][N]
It is about duty.[A][N][OpenRight]
I know, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But revenge[N]
slots in so nicely.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] know how it'll feel.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It won't erase the pain.[N]
But it'll dull it.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah. That.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just don't forget your purpose.[N]
And make sure to survive this.[A][N]
I couldn't stand to see the two[N]
of ya fall now.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll be fine. I'm unstoppable![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for the concern, though.[A][X]

Yes, mister! I'm amped up[N]

Wanna make a challenge of[N]
this, kid?[A] See who can[N]
bag more goons?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can I, boss?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

throw yourself at them.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rats. Well, Callum.[N]
Sorry.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Don't sweat it, kid.[N]
I'll just stab for two.[A][N][OpenRight]
Thanks![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

And good luck.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanRoseManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadRose][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure am. Hey, kid.[N]
I've a question.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anything you can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
give me?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Weird time to ask.[N]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think about it.[A][N]
But I've seen ya go.[N]
You'll be fine here.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll be finer, though.[N]
Just how it is.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. Figured that any[N]
advantage may be worth it.[A][N]
But if you'll be stubborn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The child's right. I trust[N]
yer ability, lad.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. Shall we[N]
put it to the test?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

I'm rarin' to go, too![A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'll show them all[N]
the wrath of Rose![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wouldn't wanna have to[N]
face that, myself.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Neither would I, lad.[A][N]
Jus' be careful, please.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] couldn't bear to[N]

Not after all we've sene.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'd rather not a dead child on[N]

Yes! Yes! Let me at 'em![N]
I'll scorch 'em good![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't get ahead of yourself,[N]
child.[A] Can you handle[N]
all of them singlehandedly?[A][N]
I'd rather not another tragedy[N]
that I could've averted.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If only I were there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's done is done.[N]

But for you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

If I'm ever not ready,[N]
just kill me then and there.[A][N]
Put me out of my misery.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps don't speak so freely[N]
of throwing your life away.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Was a harmless joke.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[A][N]
For real, though. I'll never[N]

And I have no plans to yet.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Suppose so. What's really[N]
to prepare, anyway?[A][N]
Not like we know what we're[N]
facing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very true.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you prepared to[N]
possibly fall?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I am.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
So many others have.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It'd be unbecoming to not[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Understandable.[A][N]
Whatever the case, I will[N]

I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] am glad.[A][N]

Don't be. We all chose this life.[N]

And this is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, a hell[N]

It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I am prepared to do what[N]
must be done.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I pity the young man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Loss hasn't escaped us one bit.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] want to crush all I see.[N]
Take back something.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But there's nothin' to take back now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][N]
Weeping will get us[N]
nowhere.[A] The only[N]
way forward is action.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. We fight, you two.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanCallumManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadCallum][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course I am.[A][N]
It'll be good to stretch my[N]
legs on a chaotic battlefield.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not unlike the one our[N]
comrades perished on?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Shush.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] stronger. I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] survive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd better. You've a lot of[N]
legacy to live up to.[A][N]
I've known the kid a long time.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still tragic what 'appened.[A][N]
I won't let 'em have died[N]
for nothin'.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Trust me. I don't plan on dying[N]
for nothing either.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't plan on dying period.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then let us march.[N]
Prove your words, Callum.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ha! Gladly![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanCallumWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ayup. Even if I weren't,[N]
I'd just be poundin' sand.[A][N]
No chance this whole thing'd end[N]
just because I don't want to fight.[A][N][OpenRight]
Plus, I want to fight.[N]
So it'd be unfair.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thankfully for all of us, the[N]
world caters to neither of you.[A][N]
At least not intentionally.[A][N][OpenRight]
Was about to say. It looks like[N]
we're in for a battle no matter what.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Alright, then. Do your thing.[N]
Kill every last one of them.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll strike down those before me.[N]
You two can have my scraps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, lad. Just don't die on us.[N]
We're family now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]One heck of a family.[A][N]
But family none the less.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ayup.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanCallumArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ready to run them through.[A][N]
They'll all taste the might[N]
of my steel.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I am prepared to take down[N]
as many as I can before I fall.[A][N][OpenRight]
Do you speak as if you intend to[N]
perish?[A] Disgraceful.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I would rather not, but if I must,[N]
I will gladly fall for your sakes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd rather that not happen.[A][N]
We're all survivin' this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I swear to you both.[A][N][OpenRight]
Already planned on surviving before[N]
you said anything.[A] But I'll gladly[N]
take the extra assurance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I understand. Still, if it[N]
comes to it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Do not mourn for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't promise that.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanManfredWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Does it count if I'm ready[N]
for this to all be long over?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Show some manner of tact, friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's alright. We're all wishin'[N]
for this to end.[A][N]
Alas. Until we've made good o'[N]
the others, it'll never be over.[A][N][OpenRight]
Glad we're on the same page.[N]
Don't get me wrong, though.[A][N]
My wanting for this to be over[N]
won't hold me back.[A][N]
I'll fight good as I ever have.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As shall I. I will see my[N]
duty to Viridian through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to hear, lads. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You ready[N]
to throw yourselves at them?[A][N][OpenRight]
Throw's a strong verb.[A][N]
But I'll see if I can't[N]
come out ahead.[A][X]

##Ch24_DeanManfredArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
Only one way to truly find out.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Metaphorical trial by fire.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Alas.[A][N]
Being brought to the brink is the one[N]
true way to know if you'll survive it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you can't, you're already dead.[A][N][OpenRight]
A harsh reality I'm sure you've[N]
seen many a time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've come this far.[N]
That's not nothing.[A][N]
I'm sure you'll live.[A][N]
We'll all live.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We have to live.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Indeed. We'll live up to[N]
what the others lived for.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Shall we, boss?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We shall, Manfred.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Advance![A][N]
Show the enemy what we stand for![A][X]

##Ch24_DeanWilhelmArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDean][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenMidLeft]
It's time. Are you ready?[A][N][OpenRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have long been.[A][N]
To fight and to fall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If you could keep your falling[N]
to a minimum for this battle,[A][N]
that'd be real great.[A][N]
Not that I don't trust the[N]
boss and I to prevail.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I'd rather not take[N]
that chance.[A][N]
Especially with[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] recent events.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will see you both through[N]
this day safely.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'll all live on for them.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us hope you speak true.[A][N]
There is much for me to[N]
atone for still.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm less an atoner and more[N]
a generalist liver.[A][N]
But I've got a lot to do still.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then let's go. We'll make[N]
it through this.[A][N]
We'll all see another day.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftEstelle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm ready to find out, friend.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Funny how this job you've[N]
dragged me into has gone.[A][N]
I have borne witness to joy[N]
and sorrow alike.[A][N]
I have changed. It has been[N]
a truly unforgettable journey.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though many friends are[N]
now gone,[A] I am glad[N]
this has happened.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sad. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm happy I met you two.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's enough of a reason[N]
to live, I guess.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Plus, now I kinda have to[N]
uphold the others' legacy.[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly. Once we're done here,[A][N]
we shall etch the name of[N]
Viridian into history.[A][N]
All shall go unforgotten.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As do I. But first, we must[N]
carve ourselves a path.[A][N]
Let's go, you two![A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftRose
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadRose][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Finally. My time to shine.[N]
I'll blow them away![A][N][OpenRight]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I'm sure[N]
I can be helpful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're invaluable, kid.[N]
Healing's a godsend.[A][N]
And we'll see about blowing[N]
them all away.[A] You'll have[N]
to keep up with my skill.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Is that a challenge, boss?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm not backing down![A][N]
I'll fry twice as many[N]
as you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good. Let that flame carry you[N]
through![A] This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] will be one[N]
hell of a battle.[A][N]
But we'll succeed.[N]
I just know it, kid.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftDirk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Is it even a question, boss?[A][N]
I'm all the muscle we'll ever[N]
need, right here.[A][N]
Watch me go, sister.[N]
I'll take 'em all out.[A][N][OpenRight]
Just be careful, brother.[N]
Wouldn't want to lose you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll be fine. Trust me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to see you're eager.[A][N]
Now, then. Let's put that energy[N]
to work.[A] We've one hell of a[N]
fight coming up.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It'll all be worth it.[A][N]
I can feel it.[A][N][OpenRight]
We're behind you, mister.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I trust you with my life.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not hers.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Let's see if my[N]
performance today can change that.[A][N]
Onwards, you two![A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadCallum][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Why act as if it'll be a surprise?[A][N]
I'm made of all it takes to[N]
shred through our foes.[A][N][OpenRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] know you're strong.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] everyone else was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] they all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not to disrespect them.[N]
But I'll surpass them.[A][N]
It's disheartening that the[N]
others all died.[A][N]
But I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] won't make their[N]
mistakes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I wouldn't call their actions[N]
mistakes.[A] But I appreciate[N]
your sentiment.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Whatever you call it, I'll live.[N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] too strong to die.[A][N]
And if I'm livin', I'll make[N]
sure you two are too.[A][N]
You've done me well.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't act like I can't keep[N]
us afloat, either.[A][N]
We'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] survive.[A][N]
I'm sure of it.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we have a choice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose we could've always[N]
turned our back on everything.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that wouldn't be a satisfying[N]
ending for any of us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Absolutely not![A][N]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to help them.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not strictly speaking. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
We're in too deep, anyway.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For the record, I was never[N]
planning on running.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I doubted you were. I never once[N]
considered that choice either.[A][N]
We've a legacy to live up to.[N]
Something demanding conviction.[A][N]
Something that I hope to do proud.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'll make them all proud.[N]
I'm sure of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad to hear it, kid.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Time to go.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yup. I've seen them too.[A][N][OpenRight]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have I.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. Real small world.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Almost enough to make me[N]
think hard about things.[A][N]
But not today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Today's hardly a thinking day.[N]
It's a day of reckoning.[A][N]
Dishing out vengeance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Cheers to that, Rift.[A][N]
What about you, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't think vengeance[N]
is quite my thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I'll gladly keep you[N]
two alive and fighting for it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That'll do. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well.[N]
Let's get on with it.[A][N]
This is for all of you![A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRiftArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not made of much.[N]
But I'll still try to help.[A][N][OpenRight]
Remember, young one. No man can[N]
do everything on their own.[A][N]
Through understanding each of our[N]
strengths and weaknesses,[A][N]
we can become more than the[N]
sum of our parts.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nah. I'm confident I could[N]
take dozens of these fools.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Guess a bit of support wouldn't[N]
hurt, though.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Support? I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do that.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't go dying, please.[N]
We need you alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Only because you refuse[N]
to take command.[A][N]
But, fine. I don't plan on it.[N]
Just you watch me.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've always been ready to[N]
carve a path of destruction![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a bit dramatic.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's the truth, though.[A][N]
Destruction's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] always followed me.[N]
I like the idea of controlling it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Harnessing the forces that uproot[N]
your life[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] Truly a lofty[N]
idea, Rose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? That's not what[N]
I said, though.[A][N]
You don't need to make things[N]
more complicated than they are.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I disagree, but I also digress.[A][N]
For now, we just need destruction.[N]
And we'll rain it down.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaEstelleDirk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEliza][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ready as I'll ever be.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You, sister?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Same here, brother.[A][N]
I don't think we'll ever[N]
be truly ready[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But together, we'll be[N]
ready enough.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Simply excellent.[A][N]
Well, then. If the both of[N]
you feel prepared,[A][N]
there's no point in holding[N]
off any longer.[A][N]
Let the show begin![A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! I'll put on a show, alright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That we will, brother![A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaEstelleCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEliza][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N]
Think you're up to it?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm up for anything, boss.[A][N]
That's my specialty, really.[N]
Taking on any role.[A][N]
Especially after[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] recent events.[N]
Nothing will ever slow me down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can't do much alone.[N]
But I can assist you two.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fine by me. Just try to[N]
keep up with me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry. I'll slow[N]
down if I must.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
An uncommon courtesy of[N]
you, truly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][N][OpenRight]
Don't mention it.[A][N]
Should probably get better at[N]
this team player thing anyway.[A][N]
Now, you two. Charge![A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaEstelleManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
We dazzle, my friend.[A][N]
We're the showstoppers.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Showstoppers?[A][N][OpenRight]
We've shown that we're truly capable[N]
of anything lately.[A] We channel that[N]
into our fighting today.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That sounds like a drawn-out[N]
way of saying [OpenQuote]we've got this.[CloseQuote][A][N]
But, hey. Hope's a strong thing.[N]
I'll take it if you have it.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's not just hope. It's certainty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're sure we'll make it?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That makes me feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] better.[A][N]
I think.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's good enough for the kid[N]
is good enough for me.[A][N]
Now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We march![A][X]

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Excellent. Shall we, then?[A][N]
'Twill be an endless day.[N]
Might as well start it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ready to help.[N]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be okay.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Damn. You two are better[N]
prepared for this than I.[A][N]
Impressive.[A][N][OpenRight]
No need to undersell yourself. Your skill[N]
is far beyond your understanding.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We're well beyond flattery.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But thanks.[A][N]
Stay behind me, kid.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay. I'll keep you alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenRight]
I sure hope so. These bones[N]
better still be worth something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are. You've done so[N]
much for us, miss.[A][N][OpenRight]
Hardly. And call me Argent.[N]
I don't deserve your titles.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No, really. You have done[N]
a spectacular job, Argent.[A][N]
As have you, Eliza.[A][N]
You are both laudable examples.[N]
Ones which I aspire to.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you sure?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenFarRight]
Kindness is much a rarity.[N]
Especially now.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alas, kindness will not win[N]
us this battle.[A][N]
Only skill and perserverance shall.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, then. Let's begin.[N]

Alright, sister.[A][N]

No matter what.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be fine, brother.[N]
Made it this far.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Plus, I'm here. And I think[N]
you two are pretty alright.[A][N]
Won't let anyone stab you[N]
without passing by me.[A][N]
And I'll fry anyone who[N]

I appreciate it, Rose.[A][N]
You're a friend to both Eliza[N]

some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Will I really be able[N]
to raise hell?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll raise it for you.[N]
Big fires and all that.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can raise enough hell[N]
for the three of us.[A][N]
But I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That was a figure[N]
of speech, anyway.[A][N]
We'll do our time, do our[N]

Maybe slay some goons.[A][N]
Doesn't need to be any[N]
sort of planned revelry.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, no hell?[A][N][OpenRight]
Raise whatever the hell you want.[N]
As long as I'm not in the crossfire.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
Destruction. How's that sound?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of the enemy, right?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yeah. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Might be some[N]
collateral damage.[A][N]
We can always fix that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Let's not fry our clients[N]
if possible.[A] Whatever[N]
legacy the boss had[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I don't want it disintegrating.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Coward.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Call me what you wish, child.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you're done, it's time[N]
for us to get to work.[A][N]
Let's see what you're made of.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaRoseWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenRight][LoadEliza][OpenFarRight][LoadRose][OpenMidLeft]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alrighty. Can we[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
go assist them?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Someone wants to get on[N]
with the job.[A][N]
Respectable.[A][N]
And unexpected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I wouldn't mind getting[N]
a move on, myself.[A][N]
The faster we're outta here,[N]
the faster I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, forget this.[A][N]
Drown out all that has[N]
happened lately.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't judge me, kid.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Hardly. Just observing.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah. Right. Let's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go.[A][N]
I can drown later.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Here we are.[A][N][OpenRight]
You ready for this, Eliza?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know.[A][N]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can we even do?[A][N][OpenRight]
You'd be surprised what[N]
I've got up my sleeve.[A][N]
Excellently deadly tricks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What now?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nothing you need know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've already brought you two[N]
this far.[A] I won't be able[N]
to rest well if I let you die.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And I can't imagine deadly[N]
tricks to end well.[A][N]
Coming from a child.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rude.[A][N]
But, fine. I'll fight[N]
how you wish.[A][N]
You have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been kind to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And me. I'll keep you going[N]
as long as I can.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you. If it comes to it,[N]
keep yourselves alive first.[A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Perhaps we all shall[N]
survive this day.[A][X]

some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You and I will raise hell.[N]
Sister'll keep herself safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll keep you both raiaing[N]
hell as long as I can.[A][N]
Is that okay, brother?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't do anything risky.[N]
Please.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But if you insist.[A][N][OpenRight]
Even if you told the kid[N]
to run, she wouldn't.[A][N]
Funny that I almost know[N]
that fact better than you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't patronize me.[A][N][OpenRight]
But it's so very fun, kid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can we go, you two?[A][N]
We need to go help the lady![A][N][OpenRight]
Ah. Sure. Go wild.[N]
That's my plan, at least.[A][N]
Feel free to copy it.[A][X]

##Ch24_ElizaDirkManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Isn't it obvious? We have to[N]
help them! It's our duty![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As mercenaries?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As people, brother![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was just a trick question.[N]
We've a job, and they paid.[A][N]
Eyes up, both of you.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No time for doubts now.[N]
Stay close to me, sister.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I can handle myself.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thanks, brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If we're done here, then let[N]
us proceed onwards.[A][N][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Leading them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It still feels[N]
wrong. But I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm all they have.)[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadWilhelm][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEliza][OpenMidLeft]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
So, what now? We charge?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
That's dangerous, brother.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We must.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Never expected you to say that, Eliza.[N]
Guess something's rubbed off on you.[A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We can't afford to[N]
be afraid, now.[A][N][OpenRight]
She's right. It's do-or-die. And, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Many good people have died.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Well, let's make them mean something.[A][N]
Absurd as it is, we're in this[N]
together, until the end.[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we'll die.[N]
I'm not gonna let that happen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Brother. I'll keep you safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]For everything.[A][N][OpenRight]
We'll keep you safe![N]
You've done so much[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
We have to return the favor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You youths being alive is reward[N]
enough for me.[A][N]
I only wish everyone else[N]
could still be here.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You have to take the[N]
small victories.[A][N][OpenRight]
We'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] make them proud.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're ready to march[N]
on your leave, ma'am.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It still feels wrong to lead.[N]

We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] help them.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What else would we do?[A][N][OpenRight]
Help's a vague term.[A][N]
Your help's usin' that staff.[N]
Mine's slicin' some goons.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sounds like a good plan.[N]
Altruism's good to keep alive.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure it is.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go, please.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. No point in further[N]
delaying.[A] I trust you two[N]

from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Good to see your eyes[N]
haven't gone completely.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You ready, kid?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't think I am.[N]
But I'll stand by you.[A][N][OpenRight]
More stones than half the[N]

They'd lie. Say they're ready[N]
and then become a trembling mess.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] like your honesty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm definitely ready.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Stop lying.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn. You got me.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whatever the case, we've[N]
not much choice now.[A][N]
Keep us alive, kid.[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or, as much hell as a little[N]

I may be beyond my prime.[A][N]
But I can still brawl with[N]
the best of them.[A][N]
That's the power of experience.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I may not be able[N]
to raise[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hell[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I can help you raise it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
By keeping you alive.[A][N][OpenRight]
That'll do for me. In fact,[N]
almost more fun that way.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad fun's a priority[N]

What can I say> It's just[N]

Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed, friend. But today,[N]
that shall all change.[A][N]
You and I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] And the kid[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Will[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I really be helpful?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. You've been an asset[N]

Keeping us alive is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
a challenge, I'll admit.[A][N]

W-what[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] would I know?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We should help them.[N]
But that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] obvious.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose it is.[A][N]
Well, we've fought without[N]
strategy many times.[A][N]
Improvisation suits us[N]
well enough, I guess.[A][N][OpenRight]

are you going to do your duty?[A][N]

And we'll prove that today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That we will, boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For those who've fallen,[N]
we'll never yield.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn straight.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Let's tear through.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftRoseCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadCallum][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I know what I'm made of.[N]
Raw power.[A] What about[N]
you, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! That's what I am, too![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Guess we'll just have to[N]
see about that, kid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't forget about me.[A][N]
Frankly, it's a miracle we[N]
mesh as well as we do.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Guess we kinda have to[N]
when we're all that's left.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to be a downer, boss.[N]
Just let us do our thing.[A][N][OpenRight]
We can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think later.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Indeed. Well, then.[N]
Make for the lady![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftRoseManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As I often do. Obscene violence[N]
involving my sword.[A][N][OpenRight]
I choose obscene book-related[N]
violence, boss![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose that's my choice, too.[A][N]
We very well may never again know[N]
peace. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I guess we embrace it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I've never known it anyway.[N]
Doesn't bother me.[A][N][OpenRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] laugh in the name of peace.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ha! Ha! Ha![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If that's how you two[N]
are going to be.[A][N]
Well. No time to dawdle.[N]
Let's take 'em all down![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftRoseWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll ravage every last[N]
one of those fools,[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the least they deserve.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'll back ya' up on that.[N]
They deserve a good ravaging.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Glad to see that landed.[A][N]
Well, then. You're both eager.[N]
No point holding off.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! Let us at 'em![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah! Do it, boss![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is a bit unnerving.[N]
But, yup.[A][N]
Time to charge![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftRoseArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
Oh, I'll show them all.[A][N]
If they even think of underestimating[N]
me, I'll blast them to next week![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Glad to see your enthusiasm.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just be careful.[A][N]
I don't want more of you[N]
weighing on my soul.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not to worry, Argent. We'll both[N]
be more than fine.[A][N]
The kid and I are like minded.[N]
And I've survived worse.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you have.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Tell me more, boss![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh. Later. For now, we've[N]
got a fight to win![A][N]
Now, then. Charge![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftDirkCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
Pure strength, baby. I mean,[N]
just look at us.[A][N]
Right, Dirk?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][N][OpenRight]
No need to be down in[N]
the dumps, kid.[A][N]
This'll be your chance to[N]
enact your justice.[A][N]
It'll be all of ours.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That it shall.[A][N]
The world's been quite unfair[N]
to us.[A] It's time to strike[N]
back against this world.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's all? Well, it'll do.[N]
Now, boss. Shall we?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Charge![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftDirkManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadRift][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No mercy. No forgiveness.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Harsh. But understandable.[N]
I can get behind that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Our enemy deserves nothing less.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Indeed. Still. We'd better not[N]
lose ourselves in vengeance.[A][N]
We've still much to live for,[N]
after all.[A][N]
Despite what the two of you[N]
might try to insist.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This group was that.[N]
Something to live for.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps I'll find a new[N]
cause.[A] Perhaps not.[A][N]
But only by living can I know.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well said. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards, you two.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftDirkWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDirk][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We've all lost[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so much, lately.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A good leader would try and come[N]
up with some motivational schlock.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Unfortunately[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We're[N]
all we've got.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's truly dire, friend.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But still, we must fight.[A][N]
Make something of this.[A][N]
Give reason to all that has[N]
happened.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What're we doing, then?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][N][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftDirkArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm hardly much. But I like[N]
to think my will is steel.[A][N]
After all we've seen, I won't[N]
abandon either one of you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't know what[N]
I am, anymore.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But I'll do what I can.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's enough for me, pal.[A][N]
It's been a great experience.[N]
Fighting along everyone.[A][N]
And even in these dire times,[N]
this purpose is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comforting.[A][N]
Knowing that I'm fighting not[N]
just to survive, but to live.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're a strange one.[N]
But I understand you.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll keep you going, no matter what.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Gladly. We'll take back[N]
all that's ours.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftCallumManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadCallum][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You thinkin' what I am, Rift?[A][N][OpenRight]
Rush them all down?[N]
No mercy?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A killer offense would do[N]
us quite well.[A][N]
Getting backed into a corner[N]
would be fatal at this point.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Backing up's hardly in my[N]
vocabulary.[A][N][OpenRight]
Surrender's never been a choice[N]
in my line of work.[A][N]
We were born to do this.[N]
Born to fight.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Born to kill.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And born to live.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You two better survive this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We shall. Life's been fun.[N]
No plans to end it, yet.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftCallumWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCallum][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
You ready for this, Callum?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd better believe it.[N]
You and I can shred them all.[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sad, that the others died.[N]
But we were always the strongest.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where do I fall here?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ouch. But, hey. I'll take[N]
being in the back.[A][N]
That'll keep me alive.[A][N][OpenRight]
Don't worry. We'll try to leave[N]
some for you, boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't bet on it, though.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Well, then. Show me[N]
what you've got.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftCallumArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
Time to see what we're made of.[A][N][OpenRight]
Good news. Nothing but power here.[N]
I'll take 'em all on.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That type of thinking will[N]
land you in a grave.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll take them on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Instead of arguing over who gets[N]
to die a hero first,[A][N]
I'd rather we[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, live.[A][N][OpenRight]
She's the morbid one.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] seen many fall.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're strong.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sure you'll live.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now I don't feel so confident.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway. No dying before me.[N]
That sound reasonable?[A][N][OpenRight]
Again. I don't plan on it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good. We move. Now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. I'll follow you[N]
anywhere.[A] Even into a[N]
grave, if need be.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftManfredWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed, friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now's not the time.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Then when, Rift? We may very[N]
well all perish today.[A][N]
I shall joke while I can.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That said, I also understand[N]
wanting to get moving.[A][N][OpenRight]
As do I. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If we survive this,[N]
we're getting a good round.[A][N]
Drinking to those who've fallen.[A][N]
How's that sound, gentlemen?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Great, if you're paying.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] normally don't.[N]
But it sounds nice now.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's a deal, then. And don't[N]
worry, Wilhelm.[A][N]
Your payment's just survival.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ha! Well, pal. Hopefully I won't[N]
need an IOU for that.[A][X]

##Ch24_RiftManfredArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadRift][OpenFarRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Carefully.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very funny. We're beyond[N]
care at this point.[A][N]
We'll tear through everything[N]
that stands in our way.[A][N]
That's all I've ever known, and that[N]
is all we'll know from now on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hesitate to agree, but[N]
I also can't disagree.[A][N]
We're well into a life we cannot[N]
turn our backs from.[A][N]
But I'll lead us through it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I shall proudly follow.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Didn't mean to start a[N]
whole philosophical thing.[A][N]
But I'll stand by you, boss.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad to hear.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go, then![A][X]

##Ch24_RiftWilhelmArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRift][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Are you ready, gentlemen?[A][N]
Any lingering regrets?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah. But they're small[N]
potatoes compared to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, everything that has[N]
happened.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The debtors coming for my[N]
kneecaps seem so distant.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll take that as a no.[N]
I've long had many.[A][N]
But regrets of the one are[N]
nothing,[A] compared to those[N]
of the many who've fallen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Look. Don't go souring[N]
the mood, please.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Bit late for that. But a sour[N]
mood has never dulled my blade.[A][N]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] shred them all.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good to hear. Argent.[N]
You and I make for the lady.[A][N]
We're in this until we die.[A][N][OpenRight]
Very well. It has truly[N]
been a pleasure.[A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleRoseDirk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadDirk][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ma'am, yes, ma'am![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We're quite the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unusual bunch,[N]
I must admit.[A][N]
But that makes us the underdogs.[N]
The ones with nothing to lose.[A][N]
The ones who'll win the day,[N]
because that it how it goes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you saying we'll win because[N]
we're the underdogs?[A][N]
Not true. We'll win because[N]
you have me![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rose. You are not an enduring[N]
trope of the dramatic tradition.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Today'll solidify me as one.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we go?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ah. Of course. We can discuss tropes[N]
later, child.[A] For now, we fight[N]
for all we hold dear![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleRoseCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, boss. Sounds fun.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
'Tis hardly a joyful occasion,[N]
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I suppose we[N]
can get joy some from it.[A][N][OpenRight]
What's not to love about revenge?[A][N]
Tearing those who've wronged you[N]
limb from limb.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Catharsis.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair enough.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Can't really tear. So I guess[N]
I'll just fry 'em all.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! Have at them, kid.[N]
I'll watch over ya'.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As shall I. Now, then.[N]
Let us ride![A][X]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Need you say more?[A][N][OpenRight]
Yeah, mister? Need you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You have a plan?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
But of course! It's one so[N]
brilliant I need not spell it out![A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It is?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course! Follow my lead![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd rather not bank it all[N]
on something from you.[A][N]
Not without explanation, at least.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. We'll follow your plan.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rats. I was excited.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Look[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Stay behind me,[N]
the two of you.[A][N]
That's the least I can[N]
do for us now.[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] penance, in a sense.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Fine. Just don't expect to[N]
take them all on your own.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Certainly. Back me up out there.[N]
Now then. Onwards![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleRoseWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent! Well, what're we[N]
waiting for?[A][N]
We've got some revenge to serve![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The kid likes revenge that much?[N]
You're scary.[A][N][OpenRight]
I mustn't lie, it sounds pretty[N]
nice right around now.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Not saying it doesn't.[A][N]
Just sits weird with the kid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay. And?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anyway. I assume you're both[N]
prepared to fight, then.[A][N]
No more holding off.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course! Together, we ride![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleRoseArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadRose][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ready as these bones'll ever be.[N]
What about you, kid?[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ready. We'll crush[N]
those bastards.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Spoken like a true heroine[N]
in the making, Rose![A][N]
When we make it through to[N]
the day's end,[A] we'll be[N]
immortalized in history![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]History can forget me.[N]
But I appreciate the enthusiasm.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Maybe history shouldn't[N]
focus on me either.[A][N]
No reason for that. Of course.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I could hardly have all the[N]
glory for myself.[A][N]
But enough talk of glory.[N]
Now's our time to fight.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEstelle][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We'll paint the Lowlands red.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]A marriage of crimson and ash.[N]
Sounds quite remarkable.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Weird kid. But that does[N]
sound like a sight to behold.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What beauty is there here?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hey, she started it. And if[N]
she sees it,[A] and if it keeps[N]
her going, I won't judge.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's just who I am. I create[N]
from sorrow.[A] Make something[N]
beautiful of it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think that's our hint[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Give them hell.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Succinct, I see. Well, I suppose[N]
more detail would be redundant.[A][N]
We shall indeed give them hell.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, then. Glad we've settled that.[A][N]
Hell is no less than what they[N]
all deserve.[A][N]
Vengeance'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be nice.[A][N]
And then we'll do our duty[N]
to those who're fallen.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Agreed.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]

from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
Excellent, Wilhelm. It's time[N]
to make an entrance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Then let's do it.[A][N][OpenRight]
Patience. What's our plan, boss?[A][N]
We must make the most of this chance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hadn't much of a plan.[N]
Just was gonna wing it.[A][N]
Unless you've got anything better.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah. Well, then.[N]
Improvisation.[A][N]
I'm fine with that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do my thing.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
See? All'll work out.[N]
You're both excellent.[A][N]
We'll all survive this.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That we will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards, then.[A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleDirkArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDirk][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle]
The time has come for our[N]
grand entrance.[A][N]
Are you ready, comrades?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][N][OpenRight]
I'm as ready as I believe[N]
I could ever be.[A][N]
I know you're not much of[N]
one for fighting, Estelle.[A][N]
I'm impressed how well you've[N]
risen to this role.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It is the least I could do.[N]
I've performed many a role.[A][N]
I just see this as one more[N]
in my great lineage.[A][N]
The three of us are but[N]
wandering specks of dust.[A][N]
Only by standing as one[N]
can we survive,[A][N]
and only through leadership[N]
can we all stand together.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well said.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No more preamble, then.[N]
Let the curtain rise![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleCallumManfred
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We dazzle them, my friend.[A][N][OpenRight]
Dazzle? Who, exactly? And how?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Use our skills to take down[N]
the baddies.[A] While impressing[N]
the noblewoman.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. I think I'll just[N]
fight like normal.[A][N]
No showboating.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As shall I. But, Estelle.[N]
Do as you wish.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. You two shall[N]
languish while I flourish.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We'll survive.[A][N][OpenRight]
That we will.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
And I'll thrive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good luck out there, you two.[A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleCallumWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCallum][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. Time to strike, then.[N]
The catharsis of a blade.[A][N][OpenRight]
A daring clash in the darkest[N]
of moonless nights[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
A scene truly beyond compare.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
No need to wax poetic. It's what[N]
it is. Mercenary work.[A][N]
Kill or be killed.[A][N]
We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] still alive, and if we're[N]
not careful, that'll change.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yeah. That's obvious.[A][N]
Look, no need to be[N]
a downer, Wilhelm.[A][N]
We've enough of that.[A][N][OpenRight]
Let us have some manner[N]
of joy with this.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Apologies. I suppose[N]
it is something.[A][N]
Even if it's just a lie[N]
to give yourself purpose.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's just get this started[N]
before I ruin the mood more.[A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleCallumArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I like the sound of that.[A][N]
Living and breathing enforcers[N]
of hell's will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Whatever gets you through[N]
this, young one.[A][N]
Just remember why we're here.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's alright. We'll have to[N]
tear them to shreds anyway,[A][N]
if we wish to help that[N]
noblewoman.[A][N]
May as well relish in it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose. Still, don't[N]
let your guard down a second.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll be fine. I swear.[N]
This isn't my time to die.[A][N][OpenRight]
Nor mine. It's their[N]
time to die.[A][N]
The enemies, that is.[N]
Now, then. Ride on, warriors![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleManfredWilhelm
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEstelle][OpenRight][LoadManfred][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed, friend. Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you two have concluded[N]
your little comedy,[A][N]
I believe it is time for[N]
us to make our entrance.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ha! Of course.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Rare for you to be the[N]
focused one.[A] But I[N]
can appreciate it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's our final act. The time[N]
to pull out all the stops.[A][N]
Bravely walk into the light[N]
and seize our destiny.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll seize something, alright.[N]
Destiny, revenge[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Frankly, it's all the same.[A][N][OpenRight]
Whatever it is, we're behind[N]
you all the way, bud.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Let our power[N]
shine through the dark![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, then.[N]
Let's do this![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleManfredArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadArgent][OpenFarRight][LoadEstelle][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We blow them all away, friend.[N]
None of us need take thr frontlines.[A][N][OpenRight]
Our superior range would be worth[N]
utilizing.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even so, I must[N]
go on ahead.[A][N]
Keep the two of you behind me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Frankly, staying in the backlines[N]
sounds like a grand waste.[A][N]
Two of us can endure, and the[N]
third can hit-and-run.[A][N]
Now's not the time to take[N]
things slowly and hide.[A][N]
Now's the time to unleash[N]
everything we've got.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're right. We'll make[N]
one hell of a show.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! That's what I like to hear.[N]
Now, then. Onwards, you two![A][X]

##Ch24_EstelleWilhelmArgent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadEstelle][OpenFarRight][LoadWilhelm]
Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
What's the delay, then?[N]
It's time to make an entrance.[A][N]
Show the world why we are[N]
something truly special.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Special's pushing it for me.[N]
But I guess you're something else.[A][N]
I'm sure no other actor's been[N]
through something like this.[A][N]
It'll make[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] interesting[N]
inspiration.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course. All of life's[N]
trials and tribulations[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
They guide my performances.[A][N]
This is hell, but I can make[N]
something beautiful of it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Great. Before you get lost[N]
in thoughts,[A] let's make sure[N]
we can actually do our job.[A][N][OpenRight]
Of course. Let us dance[N]
through this battle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Won't be graceful, but I'll[N]
see what I can do.[A][X]

##Ch24_RoseDirkCallum
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenRight][LoadCallum][OpenFarRight][LoadDirk][OpenRight]
Here we go. Time to raise[N]
some hell, fellas.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Gladly.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure thing, boss. I'm quite[N]
the hell enjoyer.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Weird kid. But I like[N]
your attitude.[A][N]
Could use someone like you[N]
as a friend after all this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're a middle-aged man[N]
saying that to a kid.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think you're the weird one.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Middle-aged?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, boss! Channel that rage[N]
into your sword![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can we begin?[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah. Right. Go on, and kill[N]
every last one of them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Unless they're with that[N]
noblewoman.[A] Don't kill[N]
them. Please.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
You and I'll fry them.[N]
Dirk'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] do something.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] give them what[N]
they all deserve.[A][N][OpenRight]
Yeah. That.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Should be an effective[N]
enough plan for us.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] truly remorseful that[N]
it has come to this.[A][N]
But I'll do all I can to[N]
keep us three alive.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks, mister.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. Let's go.[A][N][OpenRight]
Keeping things brief.[N]
I like that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Whew. Someone's enthusiastic.[N]
Well, then.[A] Better keep a[N]
close eye on ya'.[A][N]
Wouldn't want you to die.[N]
The others would haunt me.[A][N][OpenRight]
Don't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worry. I'll be fine.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks, though.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate that all[N]
has come to this.[A][N]
Youths like you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] suffering[N]
through all of this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whatever time I've got left[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Send you in. See what[N]
happens. You'll be fine.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Send me in instead.[N]
I could use the practice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That was rhetorical.[A][N]
We'll do what we've been[N]
doing. Stick together.[A][N]
Stay in the shadows.[N]
Stay alive.[A][N]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the least we[N]
could give the others.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine by me.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I do prefer the[N]

A fifteen year old prefers me[N]
to not be dead.[A] Truly, this[N]
is the culmination of my life.[A][N]

Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Still not one for[N]
your comedic bits, boss.[A][N]
Sorry to say.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I thought it was funny.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No need to flatter me, kid.[N]
But that's beyond the point.[A][N]
Joke or not, we've got some[N]
manner of duty to perform.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Funny that it's us three.[N]
The least dutybound I know.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's a chance to let my[N]
sword do its thing.[A][N]
That's enough for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been nice to me.[N]
I'll keep helping you.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Guess that leaves me, then.[A][N]
I'll just say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm here[N]

But I sure can raise something.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Ha! At least someone's[N]
enthusiastic about this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Those bastards took lots[N]
from us.[A][N]
So we'll just have to beat[N]

Sure, retribution might[N]
be a waste of our time.[A][N]
But it'll feel so good.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's save it for helping[N]
our client.[A][N]
I can't say I don't appreciate[N]

How are you holding up, child?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]

Hold, you two. I believe that's them.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's go.[A][N][OpenRight]
You heard the kid. No comedy[N]
routine for us today.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]All the same, then.[A][N]
There's no cutting this tension[N]
anyway.[A][N][OpenRight]
Perhaps later we can revel.[A][N]
But for now, we must do what[N]
we swore.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] get this done.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup. Onwards, gentlemen.[N]
Don't show them any mercy![A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How else? We seek[N]
vengeance.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Succinct. I agree. But it's[N]
up to you, Manfred.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Vengeance[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That sounds good[N]
right about now.[A][N]
We've been through hell.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
Indeed we have.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And now, it's time we turn[N]
the tables.[A] Show them our[N]
own brand of hell.[A][N][OpenRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's move, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright. On my mark.[N]
We stand as one.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
And I'll stand with you[N]
until my bitter end.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]On with it, then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I agree. Time's wasting as long[N]
as we're standing here.[A][N]
I've learned something from[N]
my many long years:[A][N]
You've gotta act.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] was my plan. Deliberation's[N]
never been me, either.[A][N]
Lived a life at the whim of[N]
the cards and the kingdom.[A][N]
Leading[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Deciding[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's all new.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're doing as well as[N]
we could hope.[A][N]
Better than either of us.[A][N][OpenRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight]
I've seen that look many times.[N]
Despondence. Indignation.[A][N]
Well, friend. Today, you'll[N]
get what you want.[A][N]
One way or another.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We all shall.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ayup. Anyway, it's time.[N]
On my mark.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup, no mistaking it. Those're the faces[N]
from my final day in Elba Cor.[A][N]
Perhaps ravaged by time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly, friend. What a cruel[N]
mistress time is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is it, isn't it?[A][N]
Our last chance to make things right.[N]
To make good of the fallen.[A][N][OpenRight]
You say that as if we seek vengeance.[N]
What is there to avenge?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now's not the time to question why[N]
we fight.[A] It's funny, really.[A][N]
Normally, I'd be all over finding[N]
some way to justify myself.[A][N]
But now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I understand.[A][N]
What it means to be a part of[N]
something bigger.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or maybe the ash has finally[N]
gotten to my brain.[A][N][OpenRight]
As always, you baffle us.[N]
But I see your meaning.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't, but I guess we're in[N]
too deep now, anyway.[A][N]
Well. It's been fun.[N]
Time to raise some hell.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I believe we're finally[N]
upon the lady's army.[A][N]
How do we proceed?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's simple. We proceed in[N]
our assigned duty.[A][N]
To not would be to disgrace[N]
all the others fell for.[A][N][OpenRight]
Grace isn't my strong suit.[A][N]
But they're against the ones[N]
that took out the others.[A][N]
So it's an easy choice for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I figured as much.[A][N]
As acting leader, I just wanted[N]
to ensure we were of the same mind.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're doing good. Now, then.[N]
What're our orders?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. March out, and[N]
stay wary, friends.[A][N]
Don't stop fighting until[N]
the bitter end![A][N][OpenFarRight]
It would be an honor.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Hell, yeah! Let's do this![A][X]

Well, who hasn't been ravaged, lately?[A][N][OpenRight]
You know who's gonna end up[N]
ravaged real soon?[A] Everyone[N]
who's standin' in our way.[A][N]
I've had enough of the world[N]
punching me around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] agree. Even if this is[N]
what I deserve[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm going to fight.[A][N]
It's what I've done all these[N]
long years,[A] and, damn it.[A][N]
I won't stop until I'm dead.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Keep that energy up, you two.[N]
We've got a long road ahead.[A][N]
Now, then.[A][CloseEyes] (This one's for[N]
you, old friend.)[A][N][OpenEyes]
Move out![A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Glad to see you two still[N]
got that routine going.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Any last regrets?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Far too many to count.[N]
But surely not as many as you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose so. I fight to ease[N]
my regrets.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that just[N]
creates new ones.[A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's time. Wilhelm.[N]
It's been an honor.[A][N]
You too, Argent.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We're not dying today.[N]
No need to speak like that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Onwards. For them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Indeed. We fight[N]
for the fallen.[A][X]
