##Ch21_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There we are. Fort Jraeyan.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Smaller than I expected.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think it'd be more guarded[N]
than this.[A] But it's eerily silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd call that a blessing.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
This ground looks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] burnt.[A][N]
Freshly so.[A] And I think I see[N]
some arrows sticking into that tree.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Was there a battle here?[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
Quite recently, I'd imagine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenMidRight]
Where[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are you going?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are those tents over there?[A][X]

##Ch21_Opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
Why are there abandoned tents?[N]
Whose is this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Take a look here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A ledger?[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Expenses for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Viridian[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Mercenaries[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
If you look at everything we've[N]
seen[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It all makes sense.[A][N]
Whoever's in that fortress[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] slew the mercenaries.[A][N][OpenLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unbelievable.[N]
They were[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] our trump card.[A][N]
We came here knowing full[N]
well we'd need the backuo[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And now they're gone.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Damn it![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do we do now?[N]
We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] woefully unprepared.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Why'd I think this was a good idea?[N]
That I'd be able to help?[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Calm yourself. We[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] got this far.[N]
That has to count for something.[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
Even so, as I asked, what[N]
are we supposed to do?[A][N]
Throw our lives away on some[N]
manner of suicidal charge?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know, it's strange that whoever[N]
did this left this tent up.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's even still got a bit of equipment[N]
in it.[A] Not like a quiver of arrows'll[N]
do us much good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Aren't these the same arrows we[N]
found outside?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What of it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] they died fighting.[A][N]
And this battle was quite recent.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think I know what to do.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see what[N]
you're trying to say.[A][N]
The mercenaries took down as many of[N]
their adversaries as they could[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
So now, we strike while they're[N]
reeling from their wounds.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It might be a long shot.[N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's all we've got.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I think we'd better prepare.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] right. We'll find[N]
a way through this.[A][N]
Apologies for dragging you down.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm not cut[N]
out for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Stop selling yourself short.[N]
You got us this far.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We'd better move. We've got[N]
to press every advantage we can.[A][X]

##Ch21_Flashback
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArbordia]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No matter how many times I[N]
come up here, it's amazing.[A][N]
The whole world's down there.[A][N]
But now's hardly the time for that.[A][N]
I came up here for a clear space[N]
to think.[A] Something must be[N]
done about Sinclair.[A][N]
I know not what posessed that fool,[N]
but his shortsightedness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's going to bring an end to[N]
us all.[A] He's too dangerous to[N]
be left in his current position.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadNeillstrom]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I figured I'd find you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Tarqiun. You're a lucky man.[N]
You don't have to handle this.[A][N]
Though, humor me. What would you[N]
do with Aercolyn's lord?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He threatens the law of this land.[N]
I'd strip him of everything.[A][N]
And then, send him on his way.[N]
It's harsh, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Extreme measures for the good of all.[N]
I understand your viewpoint.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe that's what we do, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What of his daughter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]She's got a life ahead to[N]
prove her worth to Dalst.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've got an idea. Once I'm[N]
back in Arbordia,[A] I'll draft[N]
up a sentencing.[A][N]
This world's a changing and chaotic[N]
place. We must stand firm.[A][N]
Stand for what'll keep us thriving[N]
tomorrow.[A][X]
