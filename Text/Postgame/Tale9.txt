##LazarusExplanation
Welcome to the Yg'stran Tourney![N]
You play as Lazarus, as he tries[N]
to fight his way to the top.[A][N]
Each round, you and your foe will[N]
be stationed in the two lower rooms.[N]
Feel free to check your foe's stats.[A][N]
Move onto one of the six metal tiles[N]
near the door to begin the round.[N]
Each round is a one-on-one fight.[A][N]
Win, and you move on. Lose, and it's[N]
game over for you! Make sure you're[N]
well-prepared for anything ahead.[A][N]
Each round after the first, you'll[N]
get a chance to pick some statistical[N]
boons for your Lazarus.[A][N]
Each one will boost a primary stat,[N]
and have a chance of boosting some[N]
secondary stats. Pick wisely![A][N]
You can also choose to get a random[N]
new weapon or pair of weapons, if[N]
what you have isn't cutting it.[A][N]
Your Elixir's one-of-a-kind, though.[N]
Make sure to save it for important[N]
fights, and don't throw it away.[A][N]
Don't worry: you get a free heal[N]
at the end of each round.[A][N]
Don't expect to win this on your[N]
first attempt, and don't despair[N]
at a loss.[A][N]
If you wish to show your might,[N]
step forward and prove your[N]
determination to win![A][X]
