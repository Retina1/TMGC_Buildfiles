[OpenFarLeft][LoadDirk][OpenLeft][LoadEliza][OpenMidRight][LoadDean][OpenLeft]
Mister Dean! We've got a[N]
little something for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it, kids? You don't[N]
need to give ol' Dean a thing.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's hardly true. You're[N]
a lovably gruff guy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What's that have to do[N]
with givin' me stuff?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What DOES that mean,[N]
brother?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You're like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a father[N]
to the two of us.[A][N]
You deserve something[N]
for that.[A][N][OpenLeft]
He's right! Ever since[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Mother died[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes]
We've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been alone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
But Viridian's made us feel[N]
less alone![A] And you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're[N]
such a kind man to us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] humbled. Truly.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I miss my family dearly.[N]
But I know I do this for them.[A][N]
And you two[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You've always[N]
reminded me of my kids.[A][N]
You're good-hearted youngsters.[N]
And Opistus knows we need those.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]But that's enough sentimentality.[N]
What'd you get me, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It's this little picture frame[N]
that you can carry around.[A][N]
You can keep whatever you'd[N]
like in it.[A][N]
Close to your heart, or something[N]
mildly corny like that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's perfect.[A][N]
I've got[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a real nice portrait[N]
of the most beautiful woman I know.[A][N]
It can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] always be safe.[N]
By my side.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thank you for everything,[N]
Mister Dean.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCallum][OpenMidRight][LoadRift]
Hpw's it feel, Callum?[N]
Fightin' Yg'stra, I mean?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What kind of question is that?[N]
It feels like another Tuesday.[A][N]
Except instead of just yelling at[N]
my superiors, I get to stab them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Come again?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was born to fight, clearly.[N]
Just not the Yg'stran way.[A][N]
It's a damn shame, really.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm still hung up on that stabbing[N]
your superiors part.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry. I won't stab you.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You're funny to have around.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll take that, I guess.[A][N]
In any case, I can understand[N]
what you mean. Somewhat.[A][N]
Being constrained by your upbringing.[A][N]
I was born in the slums of Mevion.[N]
Turns out hunger breeds a good fighter.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I lost track of how many years I[N]
spent in that arena.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, you're a Myrmidon, right?[N]
That's easy money, then.[A][N]
Unlimited power from your[N]
blood, and all that.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah. Right. Of course.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You fight like one.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm afraid to ask.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Some master swordsman long ago[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
thought I held the potential.[A][N]
I was ecstatic to learn that I[N]
finally meant something.[A][N]
He taught me all he knew, all before[N]
realizing he was dead wrong.[A][N]
And before he knew it,[N]
he was wrong AND dead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] had to do it. My reputation[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Everything I lived for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It would've all been destroyed if[N]
the truth only he knew emerged.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] am remorseful, but I[N]
don't think I regret my choices.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn. You got to live out[N]
my waking dreams.[A][N]
I gotta start taking notes.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In any case, it's in the past.[A][N]
And this group's a fresh start.[N]
Where I can carve a new path.[A][N]
Find my own way forward.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Cheers to that. I'll show my former[N]
colleagues what I really think.[A][X]
