[...]I think our best move[...][A][N]
Our only move, really[...] is waiting[N]
for them to come to us.[A][N][OpenRight]
Then we make our stand.[A][N]
We'll have watch posted constantly,[N]
so we'll be ready when they're here.[A][N]
And after that[...]?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Once we weather the assault,[N]
we march on Arbordia.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I shall have Elba Cor's finest[N]
guard your flank as you march.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate it. [...]Do your best to[N]
keep them out of combat.[A][N]
If[...] If this all fails, I don't[N]
want Elba Cor dragged into this.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]We shall not fail.[N]
I'm sure of it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]I shall remain here awaiting[N]
your safe return.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I thank you.[N]
[...]Well, then. I'll be off.[A][N]
We don't know how much time we have[N]
and I'm not going to waste it.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
[...]Thank you, Father.[A][N]
And[...] I'm sorry for all of this.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I keep dragging people into conflicts[N]
way beyond what even I can handle-[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It's alright. [...]You're hardly dragging[N]
anyone along.[A] They wish to fight[N]
for you. A just young man like you.[A][N]
They fight knowing the risk they carry.[N]
That they might not return home.[A][N]
And still, they fight.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Why[...] am I the one that[N]
they fight for?[A][N]
Surely, there's someone better[N]
than me[...][A] More brave[...][N]
More just[...][A] Someone who[N]
deserves it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I've[...] too, felt that.[A][N]
[...]I wish I could say[N]
more besides[...][A][N]
It gets easier.[A][N]
It never gets easy.[N]
But it gets easier.[A][N][OpenRight]

Say, little guy. I had an idea.[A][N]
Once we kick out Lord Arbordia,[N]
I might make YOU its lord.[A][N]
Wouldn't mean a thing, really.[N]
Dalst's going to change forever,[A][N]
and I don't know what the political[N]
landscape will look like.[A][N]
But I think a funny little automaton[N]
at the top would be nifty.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Yeah. I trust you with massive[N]

You've been a big help, Tonnamin.[N]
Funny to think you just[...] joined us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How do you mean, lass?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Most of our army has ambitions[N]
and dreams related to this fight.[A][N]
Or, at the very least, they're[N]
fighting for a friend here.[A][N]
Not you, though. You're just[N]
along for the ride.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Huh. Guess so. Doesn't[N]
bother me one bit.[A][N]
As I've said, I like takin'[N]
things at my own pace.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That doesn't really have much[N]
to do with joining us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So it don't.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's good to have you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. It's good to be had.[A][X]

Hello, Miss Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hello, Ian. Do you think[N]
you could stay behind here?[A][N]
Relax back in the castle until[N]
we're done with this war?[A][N]
It'd truly be a big help.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No can do, Miss! I've got[N]
big things to do![A][N]
Now, I'm gonna go see if[N]
Mister Zeke can train me![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]

Greetings, lass. I see you now[N]
hold a staff of the ages.[A][N]
A forgotten treasure of who[N]
you truly are.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] suppose?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fear not. I'm sure entwined in[N]
you are embers of resentment.[A][N]
Still, you have the power to use[N]
the turpid gift to serve light.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll take it that you're[N]
doing fine, Horatio.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
On the blade of [Tact],[N]
I've never been better![A][N]
I find myself on the edge[N]

[...]Hello, young lass. Might I spin[N]
you a tale?[A] One recounting my[N]
legacy of sorrow?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter, Horatio?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The witch in our ranks[...][N]
Simone Georgios.[A][N]
She has shackled my power by forcing[N]
me to cast aside my dear [Tact].[A][N]
Now, it sits alone in a Holanian[N]
lake. A drowned king of the realm.[A][N]
A king whose last wish is to be[N]
reunited with the bearer of his will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Do[...] you want a new sword?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
BLASHPHEMY! [Tact] is one![N]

The vessel shall persist.[A][N]
Now, fell one.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight] Let that which[N]
is in you bear your salvation.[A][N]
Empty your mind, and picture fire.[A][N]
Picture how it flickers and billows,[A][N]
how the smoke it belches forth curls[N]
and curls again into the night sky.[A][N]
Watch the smoke as it rises higher,[N]
higher,[A] until it's indistinguishable from[N]
the clouds that obscure the stars.[A][N]
[...]Burst through those clouds.[A][N]
Witness the infinite that lies beyond.[A][N]
Take that infinite into your soul.[A][N]
Transcend unto this infinity.[N]
Reach out for what you desire.[A][N]
[...]It shall all be yours.[A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][ToggleInvert]
H-Horatio[...] What[...] is that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Don't you see, lass?[A][N][Event][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
That's the sacred sword of [Tact].[N]
Brought back unto me.[A][N]
[...]What's that, [Tact]? You wish[N]
to fight together once again?[A][N]
Of course! I shall assent to your[N]
every desire![A] We are bound as[N]
one, man and blade![A][N]
Heed my call, and I shall heed yours![A][N]
No need to worry for me, milady![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've no idea what just happened,[N]
but I'm glad your sword's back.[A][N]
Try not to lose it again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We are inseparable now.[N]
None shall sunder us![A][N][X]

Ah, milady! I see you're well.[A][N]
Say, do you need some extra[N]
clothes?[A] I've got an old[N]
robe I've long outgrown.[A][N]
Shame to have to give it away.[N]
It's a real nice silk.[A][N]
But it's taking up space, and[N]

Praise be![A][N]
Is there anything you need?[N]

Well, some guy tried giving[N]
me this gemstone.[A][N]
Said it was a symbol of love.[N]
I didn't feel the same way.[A][N]
[...]He refused to take it back,[N]
so it's just been rotting here.[A][N]
I'm sure it's worth something![A][N]

Things have been running[N]

Then again, I guess you could[N]

The world kept turning when you[N]
