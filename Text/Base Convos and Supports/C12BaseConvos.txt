Ah, Emile. How goes your research?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well enough, I suppose.[A][N]
Nothing spectacularly game-changing[N]
or anything, but it's what it is.[A][N]
Sometimes, us academics have to make[N]
do with what we already know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, of course.[A][N]
I must say, though. This would be a great [N]
chance to dig into holy magics.[A][N]
For both of us, I mean.[A][N]
Obviously, as an elder scholar,[N]
light's a bit of a weakness of mine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] A fortuitous idea. Knowledge that serves[N]
us both in battle and for its own sake.[A][N]
On that note, I found some pages scattered[N]
about in that fort earlier.[A][N]
Presumably, someone was reading up,[N]
then attempted to discard their tome.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They did quite poorly. Only took a few[N]
hours to reconstruct the page order.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's your point, here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The tome contains a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unique power.[A][N]
Something unlike most other tomes[N]
I've seen.[A] And while most tomes contain[N]
the ancient script necessary to cast them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This contains legible text in[N]
the modern tongue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] remarkable![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Here, take it.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Catch.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[OpenQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Light, warm and heavy as pure gold[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][CloseQuote][N]
I've never seen anything like this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's yours now.[N]
I can't use it, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can't, either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whoops. Well, I'm sure you'll[N]
find it a happy owner soon enough.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay, then.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft]
If I may ask, when did this[N]
tradition of a trial start?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Great question, milady.[A][N]
I'm sure you know of the Tower's[N]
origins, correct?[A][N]
Originally built to honor Opistus.[A][N]
Well, it's said that a tribe of[N]
barbarians raided the tower.[A][N]
Brave and valiant warriors rose to[N]
its defense,[A] but most, if not all,[N]
perished within.[A][N]
However, a miracle is then said to[N]
have occured,[A] as the fallen defenders[N]
rose with a renewed vigor,[A][N]
and proceeded to slay their foes.[A][N]
Of course, few records survived[N]
from that era,[A] so that all[N]
might've been a folktale.[A][N]
In any case, the trial was eventually[N]
established to honor those souls,[A][N]
and to breed generations of proud[N]
warriors ready to defend their land.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see. That's quite the story.[A][N]
I'm honored to partake in such[N]
a rich event![A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's nothing. Remember, Dalst's who[N]
truly brought the tower to the heavens.[A][N]
Even with your territory's current[N]
status,[N] there's a kinship between[N]
Opistia and Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then let us hope we can bring[N]
out each other's strengths![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellently said, milady.[A][X]
