##C3_Kenneth_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
There you are, Kenneth! Just the[N]
man I was looking for.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Are you going to point[N]
and laugh at me again?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Why would I do that?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Need you ask?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Look, I wanted to apologize.[N]
Maybe I have been a jerk.[A][N]
How about a fresh start?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That... would be quite nice.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Alright, then![A][N]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...[N]
...Alright.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...So... How about those Yg'strans?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...We're indeed... fighting them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...This dynamic doesn't work[N]
for me.[A] I'm sorry, Kenneth, but it doesn't[N]
feel right if I don't tease you a bit.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Understandable. Honestly,[N]
it can be enjoyable. In a cosmic sense.[A][N]
Plus, at the end of the day, I'm ninety[N]
percent sure you still care about me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Only ninety? I feel offended![N]
I'd thought I'd be at least a ninety-two.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Heh. I'm sure you'll earn those[N]
points eventually.[A][X]

##C3_Captured
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStefan][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
What troubles you, Stefan?[N]
You appear low in spirits.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]...Oh! Sir Desmond! It's... nothing.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You can't hide your sorrows from[N]
your commander that easily.[A][N]
...I know how you must feel[N]
about what happened.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It just... doesn't make sense![A][N]
Everyone I knew... My training partners...[N]
My friends... Gone without a trace![A][N]
We don't have a clue where they are-[N]
or if they're even alive![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I have faith that they're alive.[A][N]
After all, if an enemy had the power to[N]
seemingly warp an army away,[A][N]
why would they warp corpses?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]That makes some sense...[N]
But why would they be taken?[A][N]
This... This can't be good.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Calm yourself. It falls onto us to[N]
find and save them.[A][N]
The time is now for you to steel yourself.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]You're... you're right, Sir Desmond.[N]
Thank you.[A] I know we'll save them.[N]
After all, we have you on our side![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You flatter me, Stefan. But you're[N]
more skilled than you think.[A][N]
...I think you could make good use of this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Is this... an armorslayer?[N]
T-thank you, Sir Desmond![A][N]
I shall use this blade to carve[N]
us a new future![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ha- there's the bright young[N]
Stefan I know![A][X]

##C3_Horses
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond]
Lady Blair, it's truly great to see you.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]The same to you, Desmond.[N]
...Say, where's your horse?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah... Old Juri? Well...[N]
This is a little... awkward...[A][N]
Stefan and I had left the barracks for[N]
some training before the Yg'strans arrived.[A][N]
I had felt my dismounted combat techniques[N]
were getting rusty,[A] and as such, I left[N]
Juri at the stable here.[A][N]
Whatever force caused our men to disappear[N]
appears to also have taken our horses.[A][N]
...And that includes Juri.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I see... Well, if you want a new[N]
horse, I'm sure I could ask Elcorian-[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]With all due respect, absolutely not![A][N]
...Apologies for my outburst. A good horse[N]
is something truly irreplicable.[A][N]
I fear trying to find a new mount would[N]
be pointless.[A] Plus, I'm more than[N]
fine without one.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I didn't know you felt so[N]
strongly about this...[A][N]
Well, with any luck, we'll find[N]
your horse, and all will be right.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Let us hope, Lady.[N]
Let us hope.[A][X]
