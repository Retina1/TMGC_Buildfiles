[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure you don't wish[N]
for the army to escort you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It is alright. It's my duty alone[N]
to confront those in Holanis.[A][N]
Those with ties to Sinclair.[A][N]
Their power is unfathomable, and[N]
I'd rather not risk your life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And for the sake of Dalst, you[N]
probably shouldn't risk yours.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be fine. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If worst comes to[N]
worst,[A] Ciraweiss is next[N]
in line to control Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lord Ciraweiss? Isn't he[N]
quite along in years?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
More than likely at this point,[N]
Ethyl would run things.[A][N]
She's already essentially taken[N]
control of her own state's affairs.[A][N]
In any case, I hardly plan on dying.[N]
Have at least some faith, Tarquin.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, sir. Safe travels.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] undone.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My legacy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
will live on[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C23TarquinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
You wish to destabilize the[N]
law of this land.[A][N]
Wash away order with chaos.[N]
For that, I cannot look away.[A][N]
You will get what comes to all[N]
who stand defiant before me.[A][X]

##C23TarquinBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You do not wish to back down.[N]
Unfortunate, young lady.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
I can't back down. Not now,[N]
after learning what I know.[A][N]
Surely, you wouldn't stand[N]
for it either.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
I never pretended to[N]
understand Arbordia.[A][N]
I've always understood[N]
conflict and control,[A] and that[N]
has served me enough this far.[A][N]
Maybe it's shortsighted,[A][N]
but I'm not throwing away[N]
these years.[A][N]
Arbordia[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, Girard. He's[N]
earned my trust.[A][N]
My respect. All you've done is[N]
scamper around the continent.[A][N]
If his will is for you to[N]
fall, I won't deny it.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Goodbye.[A][X]

##C23TarquinKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
Kenneth. Do you really think[N]
your forces can take us on?[A][N]
I taught you better than that.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I wouldn't know. I'm not our[N]
tactician.[A] I'm not what you[N]
wanted out of me, I guess.[A][N]
Now. Let us pass. I'd rather[N]
not cut you down.[A][N]
But I will if I must.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarquin]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Show me what you've learned.[A][N]
Show me how you wear the[N]
name of Neillstrom.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I'll do you one better.[A][N]
I'll show you my own will.[N]
One that stands on its own.[A][N]
I don't need a title to hide[N]
behind. I never have.[A][X]
