##Tale8Opening
[OpenRight][LoadViridian][OpenFarRight][LoadFreddric]
Is this the place?[A][N][OpenRight]
Hm. Let's see. Bandits everywhere.[N]
Swamps everywhere.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
That describes half this[N]
damned country, Viridian.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fair. [...]Over there, though.[N]
Those ruins seem distinct.[A][N]
Any input, Clarque?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadClarque]
[...]I believe this is it.[A][N]
If our knowledge is correct,[N]
dozens have been taken here.[A][N]
No clue what these ruffians[N]
have in store,[A] but it's[N]
clearly nothing good.[A][N]
The upshot is that their[N]
guard's light today.[A][N]
That's where we come in.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right. Simple job.[A][N]
Get to those ruins and get[N]
the civilians out.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[...]Nervous? Don't be.[N]
We'll be fine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
He's right. You're a clever[N]
kid.[A] You might've not done[N]
much to this degree yet,[A][N]
but you're a natural.[A][N][OpenRight]
I appreciate it.[A][N]
Still, you're the real[N]
star of the show.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Let's see how long that'll[N]
keep up, kid.[A][N]
[...]Besides, Dean here might[N]
have me beat.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadDean]
Whatever ya' say.[A][N]
[...]Chin up, kid. We'll[N]
do great.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadChartreuse]
That's[...] right.[A][N]
I'm certain we'll prevail.[N]
As long as we're together.[A][N][OpenRight]
Heh. Well, then.[A][N]
Let's not keep 'em[N]
waiting any longer.[A][N]
Onwards, everyone![A][X]
