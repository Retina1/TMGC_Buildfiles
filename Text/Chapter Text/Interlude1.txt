Ah... It's quite nice to have[N]
some respite from battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed. I'd use this time wisely[N]
to explore the city.[A] This would also[N]
be a good time to shop a bit.[A][N]
You can talk to people and visit[N]
buildings much like a normal battle...[A][N]
Wait, why am I explaining all this?[N]
This is second nature to you![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]It's alright. The flow of battle is...[N]
different.[A] Almost makes peace seem[N]
unnatural by comparison![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Heh... I guess you're right.[A][N]
Well, when you're done, come find me.[A][A]
...Oh! One more thing. I found this[N]
strange note on the ground.[A][N]
It says [OpenQuote]If you'd rather control Blair[N]
normally, press B to end Free Movement.[CloseQuote][A][N]
...No idea what it means, but it has your[N]
name, so it's probably important.[A][X]
