Greetings, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hello there! You must be Emile.[N]
A pleasure to meet you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You know who I am?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I follow closely Dalst's academic[N]
circles.[A] It is in His best interest[N]
for us to develop our minds.[A][N]
Your up-and-coming research into staves[N]
is, without hyperbole, fantastic,[A][N]
and I imagine your breakthroughs[N]
may improve many lives.[A][N]
For that, you have my[N]
sincerest thanks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] honor me, Archbishop.[N]
But for now, it is all but theory.[A][N]
I must reach further to confirm[N]
the truths I seek.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, if you ever require resources,[N]
don't hesitate to ask me.[A][N]
Opistia's amassed a veritable collection[N]
of resources,[A] and it'd do my heart well[N]
to know they're helping one such as you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate that, Archbishop.[A][N]
Once things have calmed down,[N]
perhaps I'll take you up on that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. May He protect us all.[A][X]

Lady Athena! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'll be glad to hear he now[N]
has a name. Perseus.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, a fine name. Not my first choice,[A][N]
but I suppose most people wouldn't call[N]
Count Lizardinan XVII a normal name.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I was workshopping names, alright?[A][N]
Anyway, enough about Percy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
How're you holding up?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine. I shall serve this army[N]
until this conflict's end,[A] and then[N]
I shall return to Opistia.[A][N]
I presume you've similar plans?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That I do. Wonder how the family's been.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you have children?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nope. Haven't even thought of[N]
settling down or anything yet.[A][N]
But I do help provide for[N]
my parents and siblings.[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a reason to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Quite a respectable one.[A][N]
Myself, I fight for my homeland's pride and[N]
safety. I need no further cause.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Duty is its own reward.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keep yourself well, milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I shall.[A][X]

What brings you now? More inane[N]
rambling and deathseeking?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] came to talk.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Surprising. Well, what do you[N]
wanna talk about, then?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How's life?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine enough, I guess.[N]
This beats border duty.[A][N]
How about you? This a better[N]
life than crime?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenEyes]
Not at all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Trust me, Jeff. A good friend[N]
taught me something important.[A][N]
No matter what's in your past,[N]
you can look ahead.[A][N]
Move forward again, into[N]
the future.[A][N]
You clearly want bigger things.[N]
I get that.[A][N]
Why won't you let yourself[N]
have this?[A][N]
Why don't you want to change?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Think on that. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or don't, I guess.[N]
You're in control, here.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damn it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Why's he[N]
always gotta be right?[A][X]

Say, Sir Josef[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Do you[N]
miss Dalst at all?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course I do.[N]
It's my homeland.[A][N]
I'd imagine you miss Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I do.[A][CloseEyes] Even if it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
won't be the same.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've had a terrible thought.[N]
What if, somehow[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] We find ourselves[N]
in conflict with Dalst?[A][N]
I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that wouldn't happen.[N]
But what would you do?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] tough.[A] I don't know.[N]
I've served Dalst for many a year.[A][N]
To strike them would be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unimaginable.[N]
But to leave you guys for dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That'd be just as bad. If not worse.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] an impossible choice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm glad you're at[N]
least considering our side.[A][N]
But as I said, it'll never happen.[N]
My mind's just wandered lately.[A][N]
I should refocus on my duty.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. There's no value in[N]
birthing a conflict from nothing.[A][N]
Let us not linger any further.[A][X]

Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think my aim's[N]
fine now. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't move.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure this is[N]
the wisest idea?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No. But it'll look REALLY cool![N]
Shooting an apple right off your head![A][N]
That's what legends are made of![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And what if you hit me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ladies love a man with an eyepatch.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Or a lobotomy.[A][N]
Anyway[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Now![A][N][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidRight]
*CLANG!*[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mikey! I had it! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Probably.[N]
You didn't need to block it![A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Did you really think I'd[N]
let you shoot me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Frankly, I'm amazed I got this far.[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
I'll indulge your absurdity,[N]
but I'd rather not die.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair enough. Sorry for[N]
shooting you, there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eh. If I really left it to fate, I'm sure[N]
your luck would've rubbed off on me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Exactly! It would've just been an[N]
unexplainable Carbon moment![A][N]
But those aren't dice I'm willing[N]
to roll, the more I think on it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]My continued health thanks[N]
you for that epiphany.[A][X]

You may call me Horatio[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

[OpenQuote]Can you HANDLE my power?[CloseQuote]![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

this group.[A] You'll fit right in.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Such naivety! But you shall learn[N]
the extent of my will soon enough.[A][N]
First, a question for you.[N]
See this sword?[A][N]
She's a flawless thing. Truly[N]
an immortal work of art.[A][N]
Forged in the mantle of an[N]
ancient dark lord,[A][N]
to protect a glorious maiden[N]
of light[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] It's a perfect[N]
blade, child.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But it needs a new name.[N]
A name eternal.[A][N]
A name that'll survive[N]
through the winters.[A][N]
A visionary's name that'll[N]
endure through any quest.[A][N]
A name that'll withstand[N]
the wrath of a sun god.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let it emerge[N]
from your soul.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
