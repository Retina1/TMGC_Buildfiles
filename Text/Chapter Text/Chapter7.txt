[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadRachael][OpenRight][LoadCassius][OpenFarRight]
Alright, we're nearly there.[N]
Just past here, and[...][A][N]
Ah. Well then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you see?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We've got a problem. The castle's[N]
under attack.[A] Seems the bandits[N]
are making a move.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]Wait. I think I hear something.[N]
[...]Cavalry.[A] Bandits don't have[N]
horses, now do they?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Wait[...] Let me check.[A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]This isn't good.[N]
Come see this.[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadRachael][OpenRight][LoadCassius][OpenRight]
Is it Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
It appears to be.[A][N]
I think I can also make out[N]
some knights and the king.[A][N]
They're holding the castle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's both Yg'stra and bandits,[N]
they can't hold out forever.[A][N]
We have to help them![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. I say one of the three[N]
of us make for the king.[A][N]
Talk to him, let him know our status,[N]
and make a move from there.[A][N][OpenRight]
Whatever the plan is, we'd better[N]
move.[A] I doubt whoever's here is[N]
the last Yg'stra'll send.[A][N]
[...]Also, is it just me, or have[N]
rations been[...] disappearing?[A][N]
I know, I know, not the time.[N]
But have a look sometime, aight?[A][N]
Wouldn't want any rats tearing[N]
apart the convoy, after all.[A][X]

Alright, we're nearly there.[N]
Just past here, and[...][A][N]
Ah. Well then.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What do you see?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We've got a problem. The castle's[N]
under attack.[A] Seems the bandits[N]
are making a move.[A][N]
Let me check.[A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]Well. That's[...][N]
even less ideal.[A][N]
Come see this.[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening_Dead_Cassius2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadRachael][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It seems we're not only[N]
dealing with bandits.[A][N]
It appears Yg'stra's also making a move.[A][N]
I think I can also make out[N]
some knights and the king.[A][N]
They're holding the castle.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's both Yg'stra and bandits,[N]
they can't hold out forever.[A][N]

Of course. I say one of [N]
us make for the king.[A][N]
Talk to him, let him know our status,[N]
and make a move from there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sounds like a plan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
By the way[...] While you're preparing,[N]
I've got something you may want to check.[A][N]
It's probably unimportant, but I thought[N]
I saw some shadows near the convoy.[A][N]
Might just want to make sure[N]
we still have everything.[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening_Dead_Rachael
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
I believe we're almost there.[A][N]
[...]Wait. Be quiet.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I haven't said a word.[N]
Do you hear something?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I think. Let me just ride[N]
ahead a smidge.[A][N][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight]
[...]Yup. That's what I thought.[A][N]
You're gonna want to see this.[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening_Dead_Rachael2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Looks like we've got bandits.[A][N]
[...]And now I also hear horse clops.[N]
Bandits don't usually have those.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So are we dealing with Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's a safe bet. I'd imagine the king[N]
and company have taken the defensive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We've got to help them![A][N]
If it's both Yg'stra and bandits,[N]
they can't hold out forever.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good idea. One of the two of use can[N]
make for the king.[A] Let him know[N]
we're alive. Stuff like that.[A][N]
Whatever our plan is, we'd better[N]
move.[A] I doubt whoever's here is[N]
the last Yg'stra'll send.[A][N]
[...]Also, is it just me, or have[N]
rations been[...] disappearing?[A][N]
I know, I know, not the time.[N]
But have a look sometime, aight?[A][N]
Wouldn't want any rats tearing[N]
apart the convoy, after all.[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening_Dead_Rachael_and_Cassius
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
So[...] This is Elba Cor.[A][N]
I'd better make for the king.[N]
Let him know of what happened.[A][N][CloseEyes]
What[...] my failures brought.[N]
[...]I can't[...] stop now[...][A][N]
[...]What's that distant sound?[A][X]

##Ch7_Opening_Dead_Rachael_and_Cassius2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Bandits? Yg'stra? Both?[A][N]
What difference does it make?[A][N]
I must[...] find the king.[A][X]

##Ch7_Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadRachael][OpenRight][LoadCassius][OpenFarLeft]
I believe that's that. We'd better take[N]
this chance while they're scattered.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Agreed. I shall lead us to-[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadBrandl]
Oh ho ho! If anyone's leading her to the[N]
castle, it's the man who called her.[A][N][OpenRight]
Well, the gang's all here. Splendid.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Truly! I must ask, your Majesty.[N]
Why have you called me?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
As you surely know, our pegasus riders[N]
serve as impeccable reconnaissance.[A][N]
Because of that, we're well aware of[N]
what's happened with Yg'stra.[A][N]
We're also well aware of Dalst's current[N]
political climate,[A] and that you may[N]
feel lacking in allies.[A][N]
Am I wrong so far?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I guess not, when you put it like that.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Obviously, Yg'stra's actions are a[N]
threat to both our countries.[A][N]
It's only natural that we establish[N]
some kind of alliance.[A][N]
But here's not the place for that.[N]

Your Majesty[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Young lady[...] I can tell[...][N]
Today's been[...] trying.[A][N]
Know that those who've fallen[...][N]
Their fates[...] are not your doing.[A][N]
That is a truth I've[...][N]
come to grasp with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I understand. Still[...][N]
Why have you chosen[...] me?[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]As you surely know, our pegasus riders[N]

[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Apologies. That might've been[...][N]
a poor choice of words.[A][N]
Anyway, Yg'stra's actions are a[N]
threat to both our countries.[A][N]
It's only natural that we establish[N]
some kind of alliance.[A][N]
But here's not the place for that.[N]
Let us return to the castle.[A][X]

##Ch7_Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl]
[...]So as our intelligence understands[N]
it, Ygstra invaded your barracks.[A][N]
A substantial amount of your army[N]
proceeded to vanish.[A][N]
You then marched on an outpost,[N]
encountered their commander,[A][N]
and were forced to flee to Mevion.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[...] pretty much it.[A][N]
I've still no idea what they're[N]
after with this war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, I'd say it's quite likely Aercolyn[N]
was little more than an obstacle,[A][N]
and that Elba Cor's the real target.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is there anything here that[N]
they'd be after, though?[A][N]
Something that'd demand a[N]
full-on invasion?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Not that I can think of.[A][N]
I heard some war cry from the Yg'strans[N]
about [OpenQuote]justice for their emperor,[CloseQuote][A][N]
but that hardly means anything[N]
without context.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Where do we go from here? We surely[N]
can't hold them off forever.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[...] Our best bet may be Opistia.[A][N]
They're normally quite pacifistic,[N]
but we may be able to convince them.[A][N]
The kingdom's got rapport with a[N]
famed pirate captain.[A][N]
We just might be able to convince[N]
him to help our cause.[A][N]
Only thing is that I believe there's[N]
some bandits he's had issues with;[A][N]
if they're still pestering his crew,[N]
I'm not sure he'll be available.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[...] What if I helped clean them up?[A][N]
After all, it'd be awfully unbecoming[N]
to accept your aid for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Are you sure, young lady? These are[N]
no ordinary bandits.[A][N]
This is the Loile Gang, a hardened group[N]
that lives at the base of Mt. Loile.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure they can't be any worse[N]
than the Yg'strans.[A] Again, I[N]
can't just accept your aid for nothing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. I shall send for the captain[N]
with all haste.[A] I believe he's staying[N]
in Couria right now,[A] so our wait[N]
shouldn't be very long.[A][N]
From there, we'll negotiate, and[N]
with any luck,[A] you'll be en route[N]
to Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much, your Majesty![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly, young lady.[N]
Our futures are in your hands.[A][N]
[...]One more thing.[N]
I'm sure your coffers will appreciate this.[A][N]
Take it. We've gold to spare.[A][X]

##Ch7_Ending3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadElcorian][OpenLeft][LoadArbordia][OpenRight][LoadCiraweiss][OpenFarRight][LoadNeillstrom][OpenLeft]
I now call this meeting of the[N]
Dalstian Council to order.[A][N]
Lord Neillstrom, any updates[N]
on the Yg'stran invasion?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I've gotten reports that the Yg'strans[N]
are moving north towards Elba Cor.[A][N]
They're unlikely to present a threat[N]
to Dalst, it seems.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I see. Still, it may be wise to[N]
prepare a defensive position.[A][N]
Elcorian, what of Lady Aercolyn?[N]
You had been in contact with her.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I can't say I've heard from her[N]
since the Yg'stran expedition.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Ah, right. Our reports also mentioned[N]
her party fleeing towards Mevion,[A][N]
and supposedly starting towards Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hm[...] Intriguing.[A][N]
Perhaps she feared the rest of Dalst[N]
would be targeted too,[A] and thus[N]
acted accordingly?[A][N][OpenRight]
Truly a mystery. Not worth dwelling on.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I fear I must agree with Ciraweiss on[N]
this matter.[A] While Aercolyn is of[N]
concern to us, it's of low priority.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]But of course.[A][N][OpenRight]
Speaking of Elba Cor, hadn't your pupil[N]
recently left on a research trip there?[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
Emile? Correct. Hopefully he fares well.[N]
[...]But we're veering off topic.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well. We'll keep this brief.[A][N]
I shall converse with Neillstrom over[N]
our army's next move. Good day.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight]
You look exhausted, Elcorian.[N]
Go get some rest.[A][N]
If my understanding is correct,[N]
you're traveling to Holanis soon.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N][OpenRight]
That's a rough journey.[N]
Keep yourself well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Nothing is to be gained from[N]
worrying about this.[A][N]
The only worthwhile course of[N]
action is moving forward.[A][X]

##Ch7_Emile_Prepare_Spawn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you for your time,[N]
and for lodging me.[A][N]
I shall be off in but[N]
a moment, now.[A][N]
Just need to make sure[N]
I've all my things together.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Always glad to[N]
lend a hand.[A][N]
[...]Strange to think my house[N]
was built on some magic flux.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As I've said, it's nothing to[N]
worry over, most likely.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can hope. Now, then.[N]
Pack well, young man.[A][X]

##Ch7_Emile_Spawn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile]
Well[...] What's this?[N]
A battle? Unfortunate.[A][N]
Maybe that's a sign it's time[N]
to return to Dalst.[A][N]
I should be able to get some[N]
results out of this research.[A][N]
[...]If nothing else, Blair may[N]
find them interesting.[A][X]

##Ch7_Emile_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile][OpenMidLeft]
Emile? Is that you?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Blair?! What are you doing here,[N]
all the way in Elba Cor?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[...] a funny story. I'll explain later.[N]
What about you?[A] Last I saw you, you'd[N]
mentioned some kind of field research.[A][N]
Would this be it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, yes.[A][N]
I had been traveling near Elba Cor[N]
to study their ancient staves.[A][N]
But then I might've gotten ever-so[N]
slightly sidetracked.[A] You'd understand.[N]
There was this[...] strong presence.[A][N]
A flux in the energies within our[N]
anima magic.[A] So, I had ended up[N]
making a deal with some locals.[A][N]
Slept on the floor for a few nights[N]
for easy access to it.[A][N]
I was about to go out and gather some[N]
more readings, when I saw[...] this.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Interesting[...] You'll have to tell me[N]
all about it after the battle.[A][N]
Keep yourself safe, alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do you not expect me to fight[N]
with you?[A] I may be your tutor,[N]
but I also consider you a dear friend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sure about this? I wouldn't[N]
want anything happening to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've known me for years, now.[N]
I'll keep myself safe.[A][N]
Besides, whatever journey you're on will surely[N]
make for some great research inspiration.[A][X]

##Ch7_NorthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
If I'm not mistaken, that young girl[N]
defending the bridge is named Alexis.[A][N]
It's always great to see our youth[N]
eager to stand up for their nation.[A][N]
In fact, I hear her vigor is so great[N]
that she can[...] How do I put this?[A][N]
She can exploit advantages over her foes'[N]
weapons way more than any other recruit.[A][N]
It's almost as if she moves twice[N]
as fast when taking down lance users.[A][N]
I can't imagine how formidable she'd be[N]
if she had more than just an axe.[A][N]
[...]We're in good hands, that's for sure.[A][X]

##Ch7_Mid1House
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Don't tell anyone, but I think I saw[N]
some Yg'strans hiding across the river.[A][N]
They'll probably spring up once they[N]
notice you've found the king.[A][N]
After all, they'll want a two-for-one[N]
special on enemy commanders.[A][N]
Pretty sure it was a creepy looking[N]
guy with a ridiculous mustache,[A][N]
as well as some archers with[N]
exceptionally long bows.[A][N]
Again, you didn't hear this from me.[A][X]

##Ch7_Mid2House
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
What an interesting young man that was.[A][N]
[...]Should I be concerned about what he[N]
was saying?[A] Something about a flux?[N]
[...]I'm sure it's nothing.[A][N]
Besides, if a roaring battle and bandits[N]
won't scare me out of this house,[A][N]
nothing ever will.[A][X]

##Ch7_SouthHouse
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman4][CloseEyes]
[...]Quiet. I think I hear something.[A][N]
[...]The sounds of hooves to the south[N]
and to the east.[A][N]
[...]Wings beating from the mountains.[N]
[...]Brigands chortling to the west.[A][N]
[...]And even louder hooves further east.[A][N][OpenEyes]
What, you CAN'T hear those sounds?[N]
Shame. At least I feel special now.[A][X]

##BrandlBlairTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl][OpenMidLeft]
Excuse me! Would you happen[N]
to be His Majesty?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I suppose I would be. You must[N]
be Blair, are you not?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to see you well.[N]
We've much to discuss.[A][N]
But first[...] We must bring[N]
this battle to a close.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How so?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, then. I'll make you proud![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]That energy and optimism[...][N]
Almost reminds me of him.[A][N]
I believe[...] I've made the right choice.[A][X]

Your Majesty![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Back already, Rachael?[N]
Tell me, how did it go?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]We've located Blair, and she's[N]
willing to talk.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent news. Now, before that,[N]
we must bring an end to this battle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What are your orders, then?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Understood. I shall see[N]
your will done.[A][X]

##BrandlCassiusTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadBrandl][OpenMidLeft]
Hey! King![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm surprised you're still in one piece,[N]

[OpenMidLeft]The young lady's been found.[N]
She's with us now.[A][N]
Course, this ain't the time to[N]
sip tea and discuss politics.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. We must bring an end[N]
to this skirmish.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]What's the plan for that?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I'd imagine the enemy general would[N]
show themselves anytime now.[A][N]
Defeating them should give us[N]
enough time to plan our next action.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well. I won't[N]
disappoint ya'.[A][X]

##Ch7_Zaine_Spawn
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Well, they've converged.[N]
That's not ideal.[A][N]
[...]No matter. We can fell[N]
them all at once.[A][N]
Archers, cover me. We'll[N]
wait for them to approach.[A][X]

##C7ZaineBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Don't think you've won[N]
just yet.[A] After all,[N]
you need to get through me.[A][X]

##C7ZaineEmileBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Well, what do we have here?[N]
An anima user?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEmile]
Judging by that, I suppose[N]
you'd not want academic parley.[A][N]
Unfortunate. Elder magics are[N]
a breed I'm unfamiliar with.[A][N]
Still, I'm sure I'll prevail.[N]
Maybe learn a thing or two.[A][X]

##C7ZaineKennethBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZaine]
Aha! An enemy dark mage.[N]
Time to prove my dominance![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
I can tell from your eyes.[A][N]
You lack knowledge.[N]
You lack power.[A][N]
I'll show you how a real[N]
elder scholar fights.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]Geez, no need to blow my eardrums out.[N]
