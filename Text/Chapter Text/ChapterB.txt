##Z2Note
The forts in the upper middle of the[N]
map are devices to control the river.[A][N]
Wait on the east fort to unleash[N]
water,[A] then on the west fort to[N]
block flow and open an escape route.[A][N]
Be careful - enemies will emerge[N]
once the path is open,[N]
including a flying boss from[N]
the southern mountains.[A][X]

##_Z2Escape

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Damien.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Yup. I see them, Zach. Seems[N]
those strangers are in a bind.[A][N]
How's about we spread some[N]
good deeds, bud?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Fine by me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Alrighty, then![A][N]
HEY! FELLAS![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon? Who would you be?[A][N][OpenLeft]
The name's Damien. This[N]
guy here is Zacharias.[A][N]
We're just wanderin' around.[N]
You seem like you need a hand.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's not too much trouble[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That would be brilliant.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Say no more! You ready, Zach?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup.[A][N][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't get too excited, now.[N]
Wouldn't want to blow them away.[A][N]
Anyway! I presume you're making for[N]
the river control devices.[A][N]
Make sure you trigger the EASTERN[N]
one first![A] You gotta give the water[N]
somewhere to go to block the western flow![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thanks for the advice![A][X]

What in the[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that[N]
thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a wyvern?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That doesn't look like any wyverns[N]
I've read about[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's too[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] large.[N]
And bloodthirsty.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We should probably make a break[N]
for it, your highness.[A][N]
Especially since I'm quite sure it'll[N]
cause enough fuss to draw a crowd.[A][N]
We can't afford to get surrounded[N]
at this point.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. Everyone! Let's move![A][X]
