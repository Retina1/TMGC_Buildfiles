Looks like it's getting dark.[N]
This could be bad.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]How so?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]If it gets too dark, we[N]
obviously can't see the enemy.[A][N]
That'll make planning attacks difficult.[A][N]
We'll only be able to confirm the[N]
presence of nearby enemies.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, but if we bump into one,[N]
can't we just quickly attack?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose so, though attacking on[N]
the fly like that may be risky.[A][N]
A better idea may be trying to[N]
find light sources.[A][N]
If we can set torches ablaze, we'll[N]
be at a vision advantage-[A][N]
especially since I don't see us getting[N]
handheld torches any time soon.[A][N]
Of course, it's quite possible these torches[N]
could signal enemies, so be careful.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe I've heard rumors of[N]
thief-ish types having better eyesight-[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, there's a reason they're only rumors.[A][N]
My sight is no better than yours,[N]
or anyone in our army.[A][N]
Sorry to disappoint.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]So in summary, it's not all lost[N]
if we bump into unexpected foes,[A][N]
and the only lights we can rely on are[N]
from what torches we find on the field.[A][N]
This'll be quite tough, but I'm[N]
sure we can manage![A][X]
