Guess who it is?[N]
That's right! Jake![A][N]
It's secret shop time![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why is there a shop here?[A][N]
Isn't it an abandoned fort-slash-top[N]
secret research site?[A] Who would[N]
even buy goods from it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Now's not the time to question[N]
the ludonarrative.[A][N]
Now's the time to give you[N]
a patented shop hint![A][N]
This shop's tucked right near[N]
one of the back three cells[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's in a very cozy corner,[N]
guarded by a master of blades![A][N]
Well, blade, singular.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks for the hint.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure thing, lassie![A][N]
I'd better be off, then.[N]
Gotta go meet with my twin.[A][N]
She's off in a far-off land.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I fought in[N]
a war there once.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey, this armor's not just[N]
for show, lassie.[A][N]
I make a pretty great cavalier.[A][N]
But that's enough of that.[A][N]
Good luck, and I'll see ya[N]
real soon with another hint![A][X]
