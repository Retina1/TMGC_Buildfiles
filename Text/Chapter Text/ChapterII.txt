Defeat the unknown[N]
force's leader.[X]

##V2Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadArgent][OpenMidLeft]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wizened, Argent.[N]
Do you think this is a good idea?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd hardly call myself wise after[N]
everything that I've been through.[A][N]
Am I truly the best to judge who's[N]
just to fight for?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's in the past, though.[N]
We're in the now.[A][N]
This offer just seems[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
too good to be true.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Perhaps it is. But you're our leader.[N]
It's your choice to make.[A][N]
Defer to us as much as you'd wish,[N]
but let me tell you something.[A][N]
You're the one who ultimately decides[N]
what we make of this.[A][N]
What we make of all of our battles.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Worst case, if things go south,[N]
we'll fight to the bitter end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, I hardly doubt it'll be[N]
anything that dramatic.[A][N]
But I appreciate the sentiment.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's do this thing.[A][X]

##V2Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you must be Viridian.[N]
I am Elcorian.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I take it from this that[N]
you're interested in my offer?[A][N][OpenLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N]
What might the nature of this[N]
job be, exactly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Simply put, we're experiencing some[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
civil unrest.[A] Our army is unfortunately[N]
occupied dealing with Yg'stra.[A][N]
Thus, rather than wait and[N]
risk the lives of our citizenry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're hiring mercenaries.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Good to see[N]
you catch on quick.[A][N]
There appears to be some kind of[N]
man leading this rebellion,[A][N]
and I'd imagine felling him would[N]
be enough to quell it for now.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I see. And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] if I may ask[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][Event]
That sword you're concealing at your hip.[N]
Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] proficient in combat?[A][N]
If so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why do I not fight myself?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps once I was skilled.[N]
But now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I'm a man of science.[N]
I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hardly fight.[A][N]
And I'd rather not risk my[N]
ideas be lost forever.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Suppose that contradicts your whole[N]
[OpenQuote]for the people[CloseQuote] ideology.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hardly. I was just curious.[A][N]
To the comman man, raising your[N]
blade in their defense is,[A][N]
for all intents and purposes,[A][N]
the same as raising your pen[N]
to sign a merc contract.[A][N]
Perhaps there's an element of cowardice.[A][N]
But at the end of the day, someone's[N]
fighting for the people's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you in, then?[A][N]
If so, here's your down payment.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keep it, for now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, we ought to prove ourselves[N]
before being trusted with that sum.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I shall await results.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What a bizarre man.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hardly different from the nobles[N]
we've fought for in the past.[A][N]
Though, that's the thing.[A][N]
He doesn't strike me as noble.[N]
Just who is he, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
In any case, I believe our target[N]
is further north.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Then, we march.[A][X]

##V2Opening4
[OpenLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenMidRight][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright, everyone. You ready?[A][N]
The others are clearing the perimeter,[N]
and may join once that's done.[A][N]
But for now, it's the seven of us.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadRose]
Eight![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Eight. Right. Be careful, Rose.[N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a fragile child.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hmph. I'll show you![A][N][OpenLeft]
It appears they've not noticed[N]
us yet.[A] We should take a moment to[N]
survey and prepare while we have time.[A][N]
I think I see some ballistae. Those[N]
are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] not ideal for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry, I won't let you get[N]
pincushioned. Much.[A][N]
In any case, you're right.[A][N]
We wanna do this job well.[A][N]
And for that, we need to prepare[N]
for battle well.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well, Viridian.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
I'll be helpful, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[A][X]
