[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah! Hello! I hardly[N]
noticed you there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]Eep![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Wait, don't run away![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you going to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
say anything?[A][N]
You appear to be a swordsman[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Are you one of those brooding[N]
and silent types?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry, sorry![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not great at this.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Talking to people,[N]
I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fair enough. Might[N]
I at least have your name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Blair. Nice[N]
to meet you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. I should probably[N]
get back to the task at hand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wait, please. I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
like to join you.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You seem kind.[N]
I'd like to repay that kindness.[A][X]

##C12LarondeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
Impressive! But your real[N]
trial begins now.[A][N]
Good luck, and en garde![A][X]

##C12LarondeDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I yield.[N]
Well done.[A][N]
You are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] more than ready.[N]
Now, we'll just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Huh?[A][X]

##C12LarondeVsDragonDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is this power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[N]
I have to run[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's too much[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I must do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C12Huh
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
What is it? Isn't the trial over?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I hear something. It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
coming down the stairs.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is it just me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Or does[N]
the room feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] cold?[A][N][X]

##C12OhNo
[OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Wha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What is that thing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If I'm studied on my history[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's a dragon.[A] And not the[N]
tamed wyvern kind of dragon.[A][N]
That's a dragon that's lost to history.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If it's lost to history, how did[N]
it end up here, in front of us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I-I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't know! This has[N]
never happened before![A][N]
It looks dangerous[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But we've[N]
got no choice.[A] We have to stop[N]
it from getting outside.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How will we even know if we're[N]
hurting it?[A] It looks[N]
absolutely impenetrable![A][N][OpenMidRight]
If it's like our modern wyverns,[N]
it's not as durable as it looks.[A][N]
Worst case, one of the chests here might[N]
have some kind of dragon-killer.[A][N]
I'm certain that with its power,[A][N]
as well as your power that bested[N]
the trial, we'll prevail.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I hope you're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Everyone! We must bring[N]
an end to this threat![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It seems a bit[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] stunned by[N]
its surroundings.[A] Make use of this[N]
time before it collects itself![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde]
