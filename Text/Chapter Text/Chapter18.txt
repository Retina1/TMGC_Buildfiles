Lord Arbordia. Lady Ciraweiss.[N]
I've returned.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ah, General. How goes[N]
it in Yg'stra?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Frankly, it's chaotic. Much of the[N]
nation refuses to bow to Dalst.[A][N]
They wish to see the one who[N]
bested the emperor.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
And that would be the lady[N]
of Aercolyn, would it not?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Correct. Of course, her party's[N]
taken a bit of a diversion.[A][N]
Searching for the source of invaders[N]
from Holanis that besieged Couria.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Invaders, you say? First Yg'stra,[N]
and now Holanis[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hm[...] Tarquin. Return to Yg'stra.[N]
Proclaim that you've struck down Blair.[A][N]
That may persuade them to accept our[N]
occupation.[A] It'll be trivial to[N]
construct an effigy of her,[A][N]
as to complete the illusion.[A][N]
While you're at it, if you could[N]
try and retrieve a weapon for me.[A][N]
I believe it's an axe of legend[N]
named Arkhinal.[A] It'd be of great[N]
interest to our studies.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Very well. What of our defense?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]I shall see to it that[N]
Dalst is safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]If you say so.[N]
By your leave.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadCiraweiss]
I can tell. You're planning something.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's what I must do for[N]
the future of Dalst.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
On that note, I've a request[N]
of you, if you've the time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'm listening.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Excellent. You see[...][A][X]

##Ch18_VladmirJoin
[OpenMidRight][LoadVladmir]
Thank you, my friend.[A][N]
And thank you, Opistus, for[N]
leading me to these youths.[A][N]
I shall do what it takes[N]
to keep them all safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
Archbishop! Is[...] Is that you?[N]
What're you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He has brought me to you.[N]
I shall serve your will.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sure this is alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fear not, child. If the worst[N]
is to come,[A] there are[...][N]
contingencies in place.[A][N]
For now, let me aid you[N]
to the best of my ability.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If you're certain[...][N]
Thank you, Archbishop.[A][X]

##Ch18_AllAlight
[OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
Damn[...] They're too strong[...][N]
And it's too bright[...][A][N]
There goes our advantage.[A][N]
Fellas[...] It's shameful to admit,[N]
but we gotta run.[A][N]
We'll live to burn another day.[A][X]

##Ch18_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadVladmir][OpenRight]
That was[...] tense.[N]
But I think we drove them off.[A][N]
Thank you for your assistance,[N]
Archbishop.[A] Are you certain[N]
you wish to follow us to Holanis?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
He wills it, and so it shall be.[A][N]
Besides, I can hardly stand aside when[N]
something may well threaten Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Archbishop. In that case[...][N]
Shall we continue, Zeke?[A][N][OpenRight]
Certainly. Though, given the harsh[N]
battles we've seen,[A] we may want to[N]
take some time to rest.[A][N]
If this map's accurate, there's[N]
a nice clearing ahead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright.[A][N]
We'll make camp for a few days.[N]
And then, it's off to the Aqueduct.[A][X]

##Ch18_EndingVladmirDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
I think[...] it's over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[...] have we done[...]?[N]
The Archbishop[...] He's[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
He[...] said himself. It was his choice.[N]
There's[...] structure in place.[A][N]
It's tragic, but we can't falter.[A][N]
[...]Though[...] Given the trials[N]
of our recent battles,[A][N]
it may be worth making camp for[N]
a few days.[A] There should be a[N]
clearing not too far from here.[A][N]
We'll rest and regroup, and proceed[N]
to the Aqueduct from there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright. I just[...][N]
need a moment.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Of course. He was a[N]
truly[...] wondrous man.[A][N]
Do what you feel you must.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

##Ch18_EndingNoVladmir
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke]
That was[...] tense.[N]
But I think we drove them off.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadVladmir]
I see you've kept yourselves well.[A][N][OpenRight]
Wha-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A-archbishop? Is that you?[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
That it is, child. I apologize[N]
for my tardiness.[A][N]
He has informed me of your trials,[N]
and I felt compelled to come help.[A][N][OpenRight]
I appreciate that, Archbishop[...][N]
But what if[...] You know[...][A][N][OpenFarRight]
If something happens to me, Opistia[N]
has contingencies in place.[A][N]
I shall do what you require[N]
of me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Archbishop. Anyway[...][N]
Shall we continue, Zeke?[A][N][OpenRight]
Certainly. Though, given the harsh[N]
battles we've seen,[A] we may want to[N]
take some time to rest.[A][N]
If this map's accurate, there's[N]
a nice clearing ahead.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Alright.[A][N]
We'll make camp for a few days.[N]
And then, it's off to the Aqueduct.[A][X]

##Ch18_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
If I'm reading this map correctly,[N]
we should be nearing northern Holanis.[A][N]
From there, we'll be a stone's[N]
throw from the Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent.[A][N]
[...]I must say, it's getting[N]
rather dark and dreary.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is.[A][N]
[...]Say.[N]
I've been thinking.[A][N]
Lately, I mean.[A][N]
Am I[...] worthy?[Event][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worthy? Of what?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of[...] Well, all of this.[N]
Leading us into war.[A][N]
Having a crown on my head.[N]
Everything I've recently gained.[A][N]
When all I've done my whole life is[N]
while away at the edge of the world.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Am I to believe that I'm the future[N]
of Elba Cor,[A] just because I was[N]
lucky enough to be born that future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I don't think I can give[N]
you a satisfying answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
It's alright. I know it's a lot.[N]
I just can't shake it from my mind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
In any case, you've been invaluable.[A][N]
Ever since you joined our forces,[N]
it's like a weight has been lifted.[A][N][CloseEyes]
The war with Yg'stra[...] It constantly felt[N]
like[...] I was drowning.[A][N]
Like the world was closing in on me[...][A][N]
Good people fell on my watch.[A][N]
And I felt I had to burden myself[N]
with it all. For the army's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Apologies for pouring that out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. It does us well[N]
to speak our minds.[A][N][Event][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBaddie1]
How touchin'. It'll also do ye[N]
well ta die, ye' rats![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
Fellas! It's them nobles who took[N]
down the Brothers Ed![A][N]
Well, I'll have ye know,[N]
we've got a policy here:[A][N]
No baddies go unavenged.[A][N]
[...]Get 'em, boys![N]
Drown these dastards in darkness![A][X]

##Ch18_Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][LoadZeke]
Darkness[...] If that's their game,[N]
I think I've a plan.[A][N]
I see one torch nearby, and I have[N]
to imagine there's more.[A][N]
Set them ablaze, and their ambush[N]
loses its teeth.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Good thinking, Zeke.[A] Everyone! It's[N]
time to bring light to the darkness![A][X]

##_Ch18SysText
To complete this map,[N]
light every torch.[A][N]
They must all be lit at once-[N]
don't bother dousing them.[A][N]
Once they're all lit, the map will end[N]
at the start of the next enemy phase.[A][X]

##C18BungalasBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
Gwahaha! The Great Bungalas[N]

##C18BungalasJosefBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
You think you've got the[N]
strongest lance around?[A][N]
Gwahaha! The Great Bungalas[N]
will break your lance![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
I shan't take that insult[N]
lying down.[A] Have at me,[N]
fiend! I shall win the day![A][X]

##C18BungalasAlexisBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
Does a young girl dare[N]
challenge Bungalas?[A][N]
Gwahaha! Prepare to[N]
be smashed![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlexis]
Are you underestimating me?[N]
I'll show you my might![A][N]
In the name of Elba Cor,[N]
I'll smash you first![A][X]

##C18BungalasHyperiusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
White armor[...] Like ash.[N]
Tryin' to hide from me?[A][N]
Gwahaha! The Great Bungalas[N]
sees right through you![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
I'd hardly hide from a[N]
harmless brute like you.[A][N]
Now then. Let's make this[N]
right and quick.[A][X]


##C18BungalasSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBungalas]
[...]The Great Bungalas is[N]
conflicted about smashin' eyes.[A][N]
[...]Gwahaha! The Great Bungalas'll[N]
smash you anyway![A][X]
