Well, it's been quite some time[N]
since I wrote in this thing![N]
Since I've little better to[N]
do on the road to Arbordia,[N]
why not chronicle my thoughts?[N]
[N]
It's been a few months since[N]
my graduation from the Northern[N]
Arbordian academy, and I thought[N]
it'd be quite some time before[N]
my return ot the capital.[N]
Imagine my surprise at an urgent[N]
notice from Sir Elcorian![N]
Perhaps the relegitimization[N]
of Aercolyn is nigh?[N]
[N]
Accompanying me on this road is[N]
Arin, my close friend.[N]
We both went to the academy[N]
together, and have known each[N]
other longer than I remember.[N]
...Not sure why she felt the need[N]
to come, but how can I say no?[N]
[N]
We should arrive within a few[N]
day's travel, now. Maybe I'll[N]
finally be able to prove myself,[N]
and escape the shadow of my[N]
father's deeds...[X]
