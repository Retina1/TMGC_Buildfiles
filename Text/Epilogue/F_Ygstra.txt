[...]Looks like I'm home.[A][N]
[...]Doesn't quite feel that way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] I can't imagine-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[...] It's not your fault.[A][N][OpenEyes]
I[...] always knew this might[N]
one day happen.[A][N]
It's the price of love, I suppose.[A][N]
[...]Sorry to bring down the mood.[N]
You[...] deserve to celebrate.[A][N]
[...]Stay safe, Lady Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_SoniaYgstra
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSonia][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sonia[...] I-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't. [...]Just[...] don't.[N]
I'm[...] not worth your time.[A][N]
[...]Safe travels.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JoanSoniaYgstra
[OpenFarLeft][LoadSonia][OpenLeft][LoadJoan][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
We're finally home, dear.[A][N]
[...]Doesn't that just[...][N]
feel nice to say?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Quite. [...]What now?[A][N][OpenLeft]
That's for us to decide.[A][N]
I'm thinking we wed, first[N]
of all.[A] Sounds like a[N]
nice way to ring in the peace.[A][N]
We can invite everyone we know![N]
[...]That includes you, Lady Blair![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd be honored to attend.[A][N][OpenLeft]
After that[...] Weren't you thinking[N]
of fighting in the tournament?[A][N]
[...]Empresses Joan and Sonia.[N]
I like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I[...] can't promise anything.[A][N]
[...]But I'll give it a damn good[N]
shot. For you. For us.[A][N]
[...]If the day comes that we meet[N]
as rulers, young lady,[A][N]
I shall remember your kindness.[A][N]
Keep yourself well until then.[A][X]

##Epilogue_DamienYgstra
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDamien][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Whew[...] Who would've thought all[N]
this'd come from helpin' Zeke?[A][N]
Definitely a bit more than I[N]
had bargained for.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But[...] It's been a joy.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And you've been one to have around.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're too kind, milady.[A][N]
Guess it's back to the woods[N]
for me.[A] Where I belong.[A][N]
Don't worry. I'll lend the capital[N]
a good hand first.[A][N]
Maybe stick around a bit.[A][N]
We'll see. [...]Safe travels.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ZachariasYgstra
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZacharias][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's been swell.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it has.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]Might've not shown it much,[N]
but I truly enjoyed this.[A][N]
[...]Much as one can enjoy war.[A][N]
Take care. Perhaps we'll[N]
meet again.[A] [...]I look[N]
forward to it, if so.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JonasYgstra
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJonas][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I suppose this is where we part.[A][N]
Remember what I said. No more wars.[N]
No more destruction.[A][N]
We all can just grow and move on[N]
from all that's happened.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's what I truly hope for.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Hope's not going to be enough.[N]
We'll need action.[A] But I trust[N]
in our lands to forge peace.[A][N]
[...]As for me, I'm done fighting[N]
either way.[A][CloseEyes] No more strife.[N]
I've seen[...] far too much of it.[A][N]
[...]Stay safe, young lady.[A][N]
And never forget what was lost[N]
for the sake of this peace.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadTobias][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Well, lassie. Looks like I'm[N]
retired again.[A][ToggleSmile] Not that I'm[N]
at all complainin'.[A][N]
It's gonna be good to[N]
take things slow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it will be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't mind me some excitement,[N]
but I've done my time.[A][N]
I deserve to while away my days.[A][N]
[...]You do too, lassie. Take it[N]
easy for ol' Uncle Toby.[A][N]
And if you ever need some joy[N]
and some fine cookin',[A] you[N]
know where to find me.[A][X]

It's gonna be good to take[N]
things slow.[A] Hopefully Leila'll[N]
be alright.[A] [...]I know she'll be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's still unbelievable to think.[A][N]
But I'm glad we were able to bring[N]
the two of you together.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's providence for you, lass.[A][N]
Makes you wonder if all of this's[N]
gotta be planned somehow.[A][N]
If it is[...] Well, my life's[N]
a pretty great thing.[A][N]
[...]If you ever need some joy and[N]
some fine cookin',[A] you know where[N]

Well, lassie. Looks like I'm[N]
retired again.[A][ToggleSmile] Not that I'm[N]
at all complainin'.[A][N]
It's gonna be good to take[N]
things slow.[A] Epecially now[N]
that I can show Leila around.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It'll be[...] an experience, I'm sure.[N]
Don't worry, I'm not complaining.[A][N]
[...]I won't mind getting to know you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's still unbelievable to think.[A][N]
But I'm glad we were able to bring[N]
the two of you together.[A][N][OpenLeft]
That's providence for you, lass.[A][N]
Makes you wonder if all of this's[N]

If it is[...] Well, my life's[N]
a pretty great thing.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

##Epilogue_LeilaDamienYgstra
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDamien][OpenLeft][LoadLeila][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
[...]Hm. Not bad, Damien.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
What's not bad? This country?[N]
[...]Good to have your approval.[A][N]
Though don't forget. I don't[N]
live in the capital.[A][N]
You gotta deal with the wilds.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I'm sure I can convince you[N]
to move.[A] Maybe keep a cottage in[N]
the wilds as a vacation home.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
[...]That'll do for me.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Good.[A][N]
[...]I suppose we'll make[N]
sure to visit, Blair.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's right! Or, better yet[...][N]
Come to Yg'stra sometime![A][N]
We'll have a feast for you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] truly honored.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

my father'll want me to stay.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Course. Me, you, Toby[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
That's quite the family.[A][N][OpenLeft]

##Epilogue_MikeyYgstra
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Back in Yg'stra.[A][N]
Guess I'm glad there's no more[N]
fighting,[A] but I'm not quite[N]
sure WHAT there is for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You could put together some[N]
good meals for people.[A][N]
They might not directly help[N]
reconstruction,[A] but[...] People[N]
always appreciate good food.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This place has always felt like all[N]
that wasn't mighty was sidelined.[A][N]
[...]Guess this might finally be the place[N]
to show the worth of my talents.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]Thanks for the encouragement.[N]
And for getting me this far.[A][N]
I'll[...] do my part. For Yg'stra.[A][X]
