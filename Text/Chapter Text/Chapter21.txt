##_Ch21SysText
Opening a cell will cause green[N]
units to appear,[A] who'll advance[N]
towards the nearest carpet to escape.[A][N]
They'll spawn the turn after their[N]
cell is opened, not immediately.[A][N]
Green units will be forcibly spawned[N]
in danger if you take too long.[A][N]
There will be warning one turn[N]
before each group is spawned,[A][N]
in the form of the cell's door[N]
being marked with the cursor.[A][N]
You will be rewarded for green unit[N]
survival,[A] with the best reward[N]
if every green unit survives/escapes.[A][N]
Generic green units on their own don't[N]
game over on death,[A] but if[N]
6 or more die, it's game over.[A][N]
Named green units don't cause[N]
a game over on death.[A][N]
To complete the map, open all 6 cells,[A][N]
then escape with your entire army[N]
at any carpets.[A][X]

It's[...] a startling coincidence.[N]
In fact, it's more than one.[A][N]
Whoever our current enemy is[...][N]
They're behind what befell you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd have to agree. Even so, they[N]
were almost[...] too weak.[A][N]
They seemed like they were panicking[N]
and trying to tie up loose ends.[A][N]
Why would a group this powerful[N]
act out like that?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We can ponder that later. For now,[N]
I think you should check in.[A][N]
You're their liege.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

You're not their liege, but[N]

I want to say this is the[N]

[...]Well, the way I see it,[N]
we have free reign here.[A][N]
Now that the prisoners are freed,[N]
we can go back inside,[A] and take[N]
all the time we need searching.[A][N]
We'll find something, I'm sure.[A][N]
Whether that's some [OpenQuote]true enemy[CloseQuote] or[N]
proof that this is finally over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

but I can grasp the basics.[A][N]
Seems like something with creating[N]
large artificial eyeballs.[A][N]
[...]Their memories would somehow be[N]
accessible for human review.[A][N]
It seems that it might've been[N]
some proposed surveilance measure.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadBlair]
[...]What about [OpenQuote]F-237[CloseQuote]?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This document's about [OpenQuote]Myrmidon.[CloseQuote][A][N]
Seems like something to do with[N]
magic-bound swordsmen.[A][N]
According to these notes, the project[N]
was scrapped.[A] Seems a subject[N]
went mad and escaped.[A][N]

This is[...] Well, was[...][N]

I've been here for[...] 17 years?[A][N]
18 years? Details, really.[A][N]
We've had many a project.[N]
You've probably heard of a few.[A][N]
But there's this great one in[N]
particular.[A] Valkyrie, we called it.[A][N]
You know the Myrmidons, right?[N]
We wanted to[...] iterate.[A][N]
Perhaps we were ahead of our time.[A][N]
I've seen that nowadays, they can't[N]

Well, [OpenQuote]normal.[CloseQuote][A][N]
In any case[...] Where was I?[A][N]
Something about breaking the[N]
limits of humanity?[A][N]
[...]Well, I'll just say.[A][N]

There's no other explanation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. But what now?[A][N]
I doubt you'd be welcomed if you[N]
returned home and let this out.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, we've got proof. And[...][N]
justice demands we do this.[A][N]
We resolved to tie up every[N]
loose end,[A] and that now[N]
includes my homeland.[A][N]
If they've done this to my[N]
people, they deserve no mercy.[A][N]

But you're more important than you think.[A][N][OpenRight]
If so, then I can use that importance[N]
to make a real difference.[A][N]
I understand your concerns, Hyperius.[A][N]

it's not one I can abandon in good faith.[A][N][OpenFarRight]

I should[...] ask that of you.[A][N]
So long spent, fearing[...][N]
Well, the worst.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
To see you here, and alive[...][N]
It eases us all.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I am glad.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see you've already found[N]
yourself a weapon.[A][N]
Can't keep away, I see.[A][N]
Well, I'll have to fight even[N]
harder to match you, friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]I'm sure you've[N]
already surpassed me.[A][X]

They're[...] Lady Blair's troops.[N]
They've come to save us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
R-really? That's[...] wonderful![N]
No time to lose, then.[A][N]
Your friends are my friends.[N]

They've come to save us, friend![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]After so long? I[...] can't[N]
believe it.[A][N]
But[...] it's happening.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd tell you to escape, but[N]
I know you can't just run.[A][N]
Luckily, I know where the guards[N]
hide some spare weapons.[A][N]
[...]You use lances, right?[N]
I think you'll like these.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I appreciate it. Now, let's[N]
get out of here. Together.[A][X]
##Ch21_PtolemyJohanTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft][LoadPtolemy]
It's finally happening[...][N]
We'll finally see the sun.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's one way of looking at it.[A][N]
[...]I[...] don't think I'l ever[N]
be able to forget this place.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Maybe not. But the world's big.[N]
We can make new and better memories.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]Ever the optimist.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

They look[...] friendly.[N]
And if not[...][A][N]
I'd rather not fight, but[N]
I've still got this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They[...] let you keep your bow?[N]
In a cell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They[...] did so as a joke.[N]
Thought it'd be useless.[A][N]
[...]But now, it's our chance.[N]
Let's go, friend.[A][X]

##C21_LightsOff
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Douse the lights! We know these[N]

And get those executions going.[N]
Don't let anyone escape![A][X]

You don't know me.[A][N]
Nothing more to say.[A][X]

##C21LarsonSveltzalusBattle

A big eyeball?[A][N]
You're just an elaborate[N]

##C21LarsonDeath

[...]Not[...] bad[...][N]
Not bad at all[...][A][X]

##C21NathanielBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
This place is my life's work![N]
Stand down, or die![A][X]

##C21NathanielJohanBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You're one of the subjects.[A][N]
I'd like it if you could scream[N]
some empirical data as you die.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJohan]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Silence? That works too.[A][X]

##C21NathanielPtolemyBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...]The first rule of this all.[N]
Distance yourself from them.[A][N]
Really, this is what you deserve[N]
for interfering with our work.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
You're[...] horrible. I'll[...] bring[N]
you down, for my friends.[A][X]

##C21NathanielSimoneBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Simone! Where in the hell[N]
have you been?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Places. Got tired of this[N]
whole gig, you know?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You won't stand in our way.[N]
You've given too much to us.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
Perhaps. But I've also[...][N]
taken so very much.[A][N]
And I think taking down this[N]
whole operation[...][A][N]
It'll make for a better story.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...]Very well. I see our years[N]
as colleagues meant nothing.[A][X]

##C21NathanielHoratioBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You're an escaped subject.[A][N]
Have you come to your senses?[N]
Learned your place here?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
There will be no debate,[N]
fiend. Only absolution.[A][N]
For all your sins, let this[N]
blade bind you to hell![A][X]

##C21NathanielKennethBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
So, you're in charge here.[N]
Disgraceful wretch.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Technically, I'M not in[N]
charge of this whole thing.[A][N]
Though I seek to part the veil[N]
of knowledge,[A] I am but one[N]
of many humble scientist-[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Stop talking. You and all of[N]
this are worth nothing.[A][N]
You tarnish the very concept[N]
of knowing.[A][N]
And now, all you'll know is[N]
death.[A][X]

##C21NathanielBlairBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Are[...] are you behind what[N]
happened to the mercenaries?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...]Who?[A][N]
Look, you seem the vaguest[N]
bit familiar to me.[A][N]
[...]Aercolyn, right?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]So that's your involvement.[A][N]
[...]All the better, then.[A][N]
For Aercolyn, and for those[N]
poor mercenaries[...][A][N]
You are going to die.[A][X]

##C21NathanielArinBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]Pardon?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Nothing you should worry[N]

Just[...] the past staring[N]

And now I shall purge[N]
it forever.[A][X]

You're well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadYuyu][ToggleSmile]

Chipper as ever.[A][X]

##C21NathanielArtemisBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
A knight of Gohranos?[N]
Turning on your benefactor?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
So you're one of the powers[N]
behind us?[A][N]
Well, then. I'm glad to be[N]
bettering Holanis like this.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
This land would be nothing[N]
without us![A][N]
And now you'll be reduced[N]
to nothing![A][X]

##C21NathanielStefanBattle
[OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Brothers of Aercolyn[...][N]

Let your vengeance guide you[N]

Makes my job easier.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
I'll make this quick.[A][N]
It's a mercy you ghouls[N]
didn't spare my men.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Their suffering was all for[N]
a better future![A][N]
ALL is for a better future![A][X]

##C21NathanielZekeBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Prince Ezekiel. You've been[N]
hiding for a long time.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Perhaps I have. But no more.[A][N]
You're a threat to all of[N]
the world.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
You're an irrelevancy from a[N]
dying nation.[A][N]
Now, face me![A][X]

##C21NathanielSveltzalusBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
[...]Surveil. I remember you.[N]
Good times.[A][N]
[...]But you seem to be[N]
against me, now.[A][N]
A shame.[A][X]

The breach thirteen years ago[...][N]
Was that[...] your doing[...]?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone][ToggleSmile]
[...]Perhaps.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadNathaniel]
Ha[...] At least[...] that's[N]
one mystery[...] solved[...][A][X]

##Ch21_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[...]There we are. Fort Jraeyan.[N]
[...]Only a day behind schedule.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd[...] think it'd be more guarded[N]
than this.[A] But it's eerily silent.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd call that a blessing.[A][N][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
This ground looks[...] burnt.[A][N]
Freshly so.[A] And I think I see[N]
some arrows sticking into that tree.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Was there a battle here?[A][N][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]
Quite recently, I'd imagine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenMidRight]
Where[...] are you going?[A][N]
[...]Are those tents over there?[A][X]

##Ch21_Opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]This[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
Why are there abandoned tents?[N]
Whose is this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Take a look here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A ledger?[A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Expenses for[...] Viridian[...] Mercenaries[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
If you look at everything we've[N]
seen[...] It all makes sense.[A][N]
Whoever's in that fortress[...][N]
They[...] slew the mercenaries.[A][N][OpenLeft]
That's[...] unbelievable.[N]
They were[...] our trump card.[A][N]
We came here knowing full[N]
well we'd need the backup[...][A][N]
And now they're gone.[A][N]
[...]And we're the reason why.[N]
[...]I'm the reason why.[A][N]
If I hadn't thought of Zeimstadt[...][A][N]
[...]Damn it[...] Damn it![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]What do we do now?[N]
We're[...] woefully unprepared.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Why'd I think this was a good idea?[N]
That I'd be able to help?[A][N]
All I've done for this expedition[N]
is tag along and kill good men![A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Calm yourself. We[...] got this far.[N]
That has to count for something.[A][N][OpenLeft][OpenEyes]
Even so, as I asked, what[N]
are we supposed to do?[A][N]
Throw our lives away on some[N]
manner of suicidal charge?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]You know, it's strange that whoever[N]
did this left this tent up.[A][N]
[...]It's even still got a bit of equipment[N]
in it.[A] Not like a quiver of arrows'll[N]
do us much good.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Aren't these the same arrows we[N]
found outside?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]What of it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]So[...] they died fighting.[A][N]
And this battle was quite recent.[N]
[...]I think I know what to do.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Wait[...] I think[...] I see what[N]
you're trying to say.[A][N]
The mercenaries took down as many of[N]
their adversaries as they could[...][A][N]
So now, we strike while they're[N]
reeling from their wounds.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It might be a long shot.[N]
But[...] It's all we've got.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Well[...] I think[...][N]
I think we'd better prepare.[A][N]
You're[...] right. We'll find[N]
a way through this.[A][N]
Apologies for dragging you down.[A][N]
[...]Maybe[...] I'm not cut[N]
out for this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Stop selling yourself short.[N]
You got us this far.[A][N]
[...]We'd better move. We've got[N]
to press every advantage we can.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft]
[...]Empty bags[...] These might[...][N]
be helpful.[A][N]
This feels[...] wrong, but we[N]
need what we can take.[A][N]
And I'm sure with these, our[N]
convoy'll be able to carry more.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBlair]
Are you coming?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Apologies.[A][X]

##Ch21_Opening3
[OpenMidRight][LoadNathaniel][OpenMidLeft][LoadLarson][OpenMidRight]
[...]Still can't believe the boss.[N]
Why's he ending this whole operation?[A][N]
We[...] had a good thing going.[N]
All the secrets we could want.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Are you finished moping?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I suppose so. Better to destroy and[N]
uncover again,[A] than to let the[N]
secrets of the world slip free.[A][N]
Speaking of destroy, I suppose it's[N]
time to clean up our subjects.[A][N]
Just gotta get-[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight]
Sir! Enemies have entered the fort![A][N][OpenRight]
[...]What? That[...] can't be.[A][N]
The boss had all those mercs[N]
killed![A] And he's already[N]
left for Dalst again![A][N]
What in the hell is he doing?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What shall I do?[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]I[...] don't know! This isn't my wheelhouse![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll lend a hand. You're clearly hopeless.[A][N][OpenRight]
[...]If you insist. Sortie everyone we have.[N]
Get executioners towards the cells.[A][N]
Do everything in your power to kill[N]
those who approach.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well. I expect[...] ample compensation.[A][N][OpenRight]
Sure, sure. Just[...] go![A][X]

##Ch21_Opening4
[OpenMidRight][LoadJohan][OpenMidLeft][LoadPtolemy]
Do[...] you hear something?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's probably[...] nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm[...] sorry for dragging you into this.[A][N]
Spending your last days in a cell[N]
all for showing kindness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't[...] talk like that.[N]
I'm[...] hopeful.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You'd even bid the headsman[N]
a good day, I'm sure.[A][N]
[...]Still[...] To die here[...] Never[N]
again seeing Aercolyn[...][A][N][CloseEyes]
[...][A][X]

##Ch21_Opening5
[OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft][LoadZeke]
[...]It's dark in here. But I think[N]
I see[...] cells?[A][N]
No clue who they'd be keeping[N]
prisoner here,[A] but their[N]
enemy is our ally.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I ag[...]ree[...][A][N]
Wait[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[...] is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's dim[...] But I can see into[N]
that cell there.[A][N]
And[...] that outfit is unmistakable.[A][N][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I don't follow.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
[...]Everyone! Prepare to move out![N]
Leave no cell unopened![A][N]
Today, we liberate our proud[N]
soldiers of Aercolyn![A][X]

The whole world's down there.[A][N]
But now's hardly the time for that.[A][N]
I came up here for a clear space[N]
to think.[A] Something must be[N]
done about Sinclair.[A][N]
I know not what posessed that fool,[N]
but his shortsightedness[...][A][N]
It's going to bring an end to[N]
us all.[A] He's too dangerous to[N]

[...]I figured I'd find you here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, Tarquin. You're a lucky man.[N]
You don't have to handle this.[A][N]
Though, humor me. What would you[N]
do with Aercolyn's lord?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
He threatens the law of this land.[N]
I'd strip him of everything.[A][N]
And then, send him on his way.[N]
It's harsh, I know[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Extreme measures for the good of all.[N]
I understand your viewpoint.[A][N]
[...]Maybe that's what we do, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What of his daughter?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]She's got a life ahead to[N]
prove her worth to Dalst.[A][N]
[...]I've got an idea. Once I'm[N]
back in Arbordia,[A] I'll draft[N]

This world's a changing and chaotic[N]

Stand for what'll keep us thriving[N]
