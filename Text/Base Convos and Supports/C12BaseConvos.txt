[OpenMidLeft][LoadEmile][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Ah, Emile. How goes your research?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well enough, I suppose.[A][N]
Nothing spectacularly game-changing[N]
or anything, but it's what it is.[A][N]
Sometimes, us academics have to make[N]
do with what we already know.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, of course.[A][N]
I must say, though. This would be a great [N]
chance to dig into holy magics.[A][N]
For both of us, I mean.[A][N]
Obviously, as an elder scholar,[N]
light's a bit of a weakness of mine.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] A fortuitous idea. Knowledge that serves[N]
us both in battle and for its own sake.[A][N]
On that note, I found some pages scattered[N]
about in that fort earlier.[A][N]
Presumably, someone was reading up,[N]
then attempted to discard their tome.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They did quite poorly. Only took a few[N]
hours to reconstruct the page order.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's your point, here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The tome contains a[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unique power.[A][N]
Something unlike most other tomes[N]
I've seen.[A] And while most tomes contain[N]
the ancient script necessary to cast them[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This contains legible text in[N]
the modern tongue.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, really? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] remarkable![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Here, take it.[A][N][MoveMidLeft]
Catch.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[OpenQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Light, warm and heavy as pure gold[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][CloseQuote][N]
I've never seen anything like this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's yours now.[N]
I can't use it, anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I can't, either.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Whoops. Well, I'm sure you'll[N]
find it a happy owner soon enough.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Okay, then.[A][X]

The Trial[X]

##C12_The_Trial
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLaronde][OpenMidLeft]
If I may ask, when did this[N]
tradition of a trial start?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Great question, milady.[A][N]
I'm sure you know of the Tower's[N]
origins, correct?[A][N]
Originally built to honor Opistus.[A][N]
Well, it's said that a tribe of[N]
barbarians raided the tower.[A][N]
Brave and valiant warriors rose to[N]
its defense,[A] but most, if not all,[N]
perished within.[A][N]
However, a miracle is then said to[N]
have occured,[A] as the fallen defenders[N]
rose with a renewed vigor,[A][N]
and proceeded to slay their foes.[A][N]
Of course, few records survived[N]
from that era,[A] so that all[N]
might've been a folktale.[A][N]
In any case, the trial was eventually[N]
established to honor those souls,[A][N]
and to breed generations of proud[N]
warriors ready to defend their land.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see. That's quite the story.[A][N]
I'm honored to partake in such[N]
a rich event![A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's nothing. Remember, Dalst's who[N]
truly brought the tower to the heavens.[A][N]
Even with your territory's current[N]
status,[N] there's a kinship between[N]
Opistia and Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Then let us hope we can bring[N]
out each other's strengths![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellently said, milady.[A][X]

##C12_Natasia_Peggy_Base
[OpenMidRight][LoadPeggy]
Hyah![A][MoveMidRight] Ayah![A][MoveMidRight]
Wbamo![A][N]
Phew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That was exhausting[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But I'm getting better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadNatasia]
Oh, heya, Peggy! How've you been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Pretty damn excellent, I'd say.[A][N]
Nearly broke this staff in half[N]
on a dummy.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You mean a training dummy, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sure. If it makes you feel better.[N]
Anyway, how've you been doing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've been alright. It's been chaotic,[N]
but hey.[A] If I weren't fighting,[N]
I'd be bored out of my mind at home.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Amen to that. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We should probably find[N]
healthier ways to entertain ourselves.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Eh. I've always been able to take[N]
a beating.[A] We've a battle coming up,[N]
but remind me when we're done.[A][N]
You'd love hearing about the[N]
Coriander Incident.[A][N]
See ya![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Coriander incident? Damn. If it's got[N]
that big a spectre looming over it,[A][N]
it's surely got all my war stories[N]
beat for sheer entertainment.[A][X]

##C12_Stefan_Josef_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJosef][OpenMidRight][LoadStefan]
Are you prepared for the trial, Josef?[N]
I know I'm ready to show my might![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ha! Of course! Nobody in Opistia[N]
can possibly touch my armor![A][N]
I fear for you, though. Your armor[N]
isn't hardy like mine.[A][N]
One wrong move and you're done![A][N][OpenMidRight]
You think to slight me, sir? Frankly, I[N]
doubt your ability against their monks.[A][N]
They're swift as wind, and their beams[N]
of light are fierce as fire![A][N]
Your armor can't save you from that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose. That's what your job is.[N]
Strike the monks before they touch me.[A][N]
We've got[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a symbiotic relationship.[N]
That IS how battle works, Stefan.[A][N]
Your allies cover your weaknesses.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But of course![A][N][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm a brilliant knight! I'll show[N]
him who can't handle things alone.)[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rats. He got me there.[N]
But I can still take 'em all.)[A][X]

##C12_Arin_Sveltzalus_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadSveltzalus]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft]
Ah. You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Sveltzalus, correct?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why am I asking that? You're an eye.[N]
No possible way to answer me.[A][N]
Well, then.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I wonder what went through her head.[A][N]
To make her think taking in an eyeball[N]
while on the run was a good plan.[A][N]
No offense to you, of course.[N]
You've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been quite helpful.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So I guess it did work out.[N]
Still.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well. Thanks for listening.[N]
I think. Can you hear me?[A][N]
Are there ears in there?[N]
Guess I'll never quite know.[A][X]


##C12_Kenneth_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've been looking at me[N]
like that for a while.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Do I have something on my face?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see your dark magic. Are[N]
you some kind of villain?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What are you talking about? I'm Kenneth.[N]
Been with Blair since the beginning.[A][N]
I'd hardly call that a villain in[N]
any sense of the word.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But dark magic is the[N]
magic of darkness![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? Do you genuinely think all[N]
elder scholars slither in the dark?[A][N]
It's a perfectly reputable brand of magic.[N]
Even within Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hmph![ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And he's gone. Guess I'll[N]
have to continue another time.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What be the problem, lassie?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] n-nothing.[A][N]
No p-problems here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye? Ye sure? Yer tremblin' like ya[N]
had one too many pints,[A][N]
and yer cap'n's hurlin' obscenities[N]
'n axes at'cha in equal measure.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What? I swear[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm a-alright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, matey. Suit yerself.[N]
I got me an axe ta sharpen.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]H-he's a pirate[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why i-is he so kind?[A][X]
