##Ch9_Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
How're you lassies holdin' up?[N]
'Ave ye ever been to sea before?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Can't say that I have.[N]
It's fine enough.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I'm quite enjoying it![N]
It's a nice change of pace.[A][X]

##Ch9_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadBaddie1]
...Arr.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, hello there, good sir.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...What? ...I be a pirate, bucko.[N]
Hardly good or a sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Well, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye. We be taking your gold,[N]
and your life.[A][X]

##Ch9_Opening3
[OpenLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft][LoadArin][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Blimey... Thar be pirates.[N]
Attackin' a poor Opistian boat.[A][N]
Welp, guess we're goin' around.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I could hardly do that, captain![N]
We need to help them![A][N][OpenMidRight]
...Arr, fine. These do be my seas,[N]
after all. Gotta show them who's boss.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
How do you expect us to fight?[N]
We can't just walk on water.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't worry about those details.[A][N]
My boys'll get planks rigged and anchored[N]
faster than ye can think.[A][N]
Course, we be joinin' the fray, too.[N]
We'll make this quick.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Excellent! We've no time to lose.[A][X]

##Ch9_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadApollo][OpenFarRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
It seems the pirates are retreating.[N]
I think that's it for now.[A][N][OpenRight]
Ah, most excellent! Unfortunately,[N]
I believe our vessel was trashed.[A][N]
Our little band shant be going[N]
anywhere at this rate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, as I said earlier, you're free[N]
to travel with us.[A] We're headed[N]
to Opistia, ourselves.[A][N][OpenRight]
Would that truly be all right?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, lad. We gots the room, and[N]
we can't just leave ya adrift.[A][N]
...I mean, we could. But the[N]
lass may not approve o' that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I'm still here, captain.[A][N][OpenRight]
If need be, I'll continue to fight[N]
for you.[A] It's only right, given[N]
that you fought for my companions.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yeah, yeah. Get on wit' movin'.[N]
We've got lots o' sea left to go.[A][X]

##Ch9_Ending_Apollo_Dead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
It seems the pirates are retreating.[N]
I think that's it for now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A job well done, lass. Say...[N]
What's our plan with those monks?[A][N]
From a quick look, their boat's in[N]
a bad shape. They won't be goin' nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd imagine they're Opistia bound.[A][N]
If we have the room, we should[N]
let them come with us.[A][N]
The other option would be leaving[N]
them floating at sea.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...I mean... The sea's a nice place.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aye, I be jokin', lass.[N]
Go make the arrangements.[A][N]
I'll get me boys to prepare to[N]
disembark on your word.[A][N]
We've got lots o' sea left to go.[A][X]

##Ch9_Ending_Apollo_Unrecruited
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenFarRight][LoadCid][OpenMidLeft]
It seems the pirates are retreating.[N]
I think that's it for now.[A][N][OpenRight][LoadApollo]
Excuse me, milady?[A][N]
The name's Apollo. I'm with the[N]
boat you protected.[A][N]
Thank you for that, by the way![A][N]
Anyway, we've got... a bit of a problem.[N]
Our boat's trashed. We're going nowhere.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Would you like to travel[N]
with us?[A] We're headed[N]
to Opistia, ourselves.[A][N][OpenRight]
Would that truly be all right?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Aye, lad. We gots the room, and[N]
we can't just leave ya adrift.[A][N]
...I mean, we could. But the[N]
lass may not approve o' that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
...I'm still here, captain.[A][N][OpenRight]
Thank you. You've truly saved us.[A][N]
If the time comes, I will fight for you.[N]
It's only right, after what you did.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yeah, yeah. Get on wit' movin'.[N]
We've got lots o' sea left to go.[A][X]

Aye, I do be the lifeblood[N]
of the great Shanty Pete![A][N]
Me an' me boys sing his name[N]
as we sail the seas![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Ha! You haven't changed a[N]
bit, chum.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPete]
Aye, you got me.[A][N]
Anyway, seems yer job servin'[N]

Our duel shall be the stuff[N]
of legends, old matey.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPete]
Aye, I'd have it no[N]
other way.[A][X]

##C9PeteBechamelBattle

the cursor flashes on them.[A][X]

##C9CidDeath
[OpenMidRight][LoadCid]
Blast... That smarts![N]
Apologies, fellas.[A][N]
Clean up fer yer[N]
captain, alright?[A][X]

##C9T1Apollo
[OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Is that another boat?[N]
Have our prayers finally been answered?[A][N]
...Did they perchance notice my[N]
panicked lightshow I was casting?[A][N]
In any case... If we can just hold[N]
out a bit longer, we'll be okay.[A][N]
Opistus... Grant us strength.[A][X]

##C9T1Bechamel
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][CloseEyes]
Aye... What're you doin' to us, Pete?[N]
Attackin' a holy vessel like this?[A][N]
That just... don't sit right.[A][N]
But he's the cap... He knows[N]
what's best fer the crew...[A][N]
Still... Maybe it be time fer[N]
a fresh start.[A] If I do wanna[N]
repent, I've got holy men right here.[A][X]

##Ch9_Apollo_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
You, there! Are you here to help us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You could say that.[N]
Is everyone alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...Unfortunately, we're the only[N]
ones left, now.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But your presence will at least[N]
help save those who remain.[A][N]
I'm Apollo, by the way.[N]
Wandering monk of Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nice to meet you. Does your[N]
crew want to evacuate to our boat?[A][N]
We should be able to keep you[N]
relatively safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It would be quite unbecoming of us[N]
to idly sit by like that.[A][N]
...Though once this battle is through,[N]
we'd appreciate that offer.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alright, then. I'm Blair.[N]
If you're ready, let's go.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But of course. I shall[N]
serve faithfully.[A][X]

##Ch9_Bechamel_Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadApollo]
Another pirate? But you seem...[N]
so much more sorrowful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye, ye got me. Name's Bechamel.[A][N]
Piracy... It be all I know since I[N]
was a wee lad.[A] Hell, before that,[N]
me family were from the Lowlands.[A][N]
That hellscape be like the world's[N]
worst seas, 'cept you cannae sail away.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
If you do not like this life,[N]
why not leave it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If only it be that simple, bucko.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
...I just so happen to be in the[N]
company of a fine young lady.[A][N]
I'd imagine she needs all the[N]
strength she can get,[A][N]
and I trust her cause to be[N]
one of noble intent.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you sayin'... there still be[N]
a chance fer old me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Opistus tells us that for those who[N]
seek it, there will be salvation.[A][N]
Take my hand, and begin your[N]
new path with head held high.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
...Thank ye. Me days o' piracy end here.[A][N]
...Still gonna fight like one, because that's[N]
all I know.[A] ...Change be hard, okay?[A][X]
