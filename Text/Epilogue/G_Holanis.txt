##Epilogue_HoratioHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
I[...] grow weary.[A][N]
Perhaps it is time for[N]
mine sword to rest.[A][N]
[...]Fret not, milady. One day,[N]
[Tact] shall rise again.[A][N]
Amidst an hour darkest, it shall[N]
be the key that beckons light.[A][N]
[...]Until then, my friend.[N]
Rest your rest sublime.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I[...] will never quite[N]
understand you, Horatio.[A][X]

##Epilogue_HoratioHolanisAlt
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadHoratio]
[Tact]! Are you ready, mine[N]
immortal sword? Mine companion?[A][N]
We shall be the unexpected[N]
answer of the caller![A][N]
The duo from which generations[N]
of evil have no escape![A][N]
That which binds the last promise[N]
we have sworn unto each other![A][N]
[...]Milady. We thank you for your[N]
guidance along our journey.[A][N]
Our bond is our iron will, made[N]
manifest in an eternal emblem![A][N]
[...]Farewell. May we meet again,[N]
if providence wills it so.[A][N]
And if not, embrace your path with[N]
hoisted sword and pride in the heart![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks, Horatio. You too.[A][X]

##Epilogue_SimoneHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSimone]
[...]And so, it is over.[A][N]
Perhaps we can all finally[N]
move on from Jraeyan.[A][N]
I've grown tired of theory and [OpenQuote]rigor,[CloseQuote][N]
whatever that even is anymore.[A][N]
Hell, I think I might be more[N]
a historian more than anything.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps that shall become my[N]
new calling.[A] This tale cannot[N]
go forgotten. Am I wrong?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're right. Do you plan[N]
to write of the war?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And of surrounding incidents[N]
and personalities.[A][N]
On that note, perhaps once[N]
all is settled,[A] I could[N]
throughly interview you.[A][N]
I plan to do the same with all[N]
of our numbers, incidentally.[A][N]
Create as throrough an account[N]
as I possibly can.[A][N]
[...]Think on what you wish to[N]
say.[A] How you wish to be[N]
remembered in all this.[A][N]
[...]Until then, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_PtolemyHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadPtolemy]
This truly is a very pretty place.[N]
[...]I know my bees quite like it.[A][N]
It could be even better, though.[N]
More flowers, for one.[A][N]
[...]I know focusing on these things[N]
might sound odd at a time like this.[A][N]
But I'm just[...] happy to have[N]
made it through this war.[A][N]
I'll gladly appreciate the little[N]
things. Like I always have.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nothing's wrong with that at all.[N]
No need to apologize.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Of course. [...]Stay safe,[N]
Lady Blair.[A] Tell Aercolyn's[N]
bees that I said hello![A][X]

##Epilogue_DeanHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadDean]
Still gotta lotta eastward[N]
travel to go.[A][N]
The family's waitin' fer me.[N]
[...]Truly lucky to still be 'ere.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm[...] still sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]It's the risk we take, lass.[N]
I knew it. They all knew it.[A][N]
I'd rather celebrate bein' alive[N]
than drown in regrets.[A][N]
There's still good in my life.[N]
I'll appreciate it while I can.[A][N]
You oughtta too, lass.[A][N]
[...]Take care, and thanks[N]
for leadin' us.[A][X]

##Epilogue_IanHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadIan]
That[...] was awesome! I wish[N]
I could've fought more[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nope. Back to your parents.[A][N]
Once we're done here, we're[N]
returning to the Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aw, man. Well, one day, miss.[N]
Ian'll rise again.[A][N]
I'll be the brave hero that[N]
saves the world![A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I'm sure you will.[A][X]

##Epilogue_QHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadQ]
Well, off I go.[A] There's many[N]
more adventures to be had.[A][N]
Thanks for draggin' me on[N]
with you for this one.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're[...] welcome? I thought you[N]
came of your own will.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right, right. Still, thanks[N]
for the chance to fight.[A][N]
See you around. And don't you[N]
ever forget the name Q.[A][X]

##Epilogue_TonnaminHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadTonnamin]
Whew[...] Think I'm gonna stay[N]
back in this inn a while.[A][N]
Not to say I didn't enjoy my[N]
time with you.[A] Quite the[N]
contrary, in fact.[A][N]
But I've gotta take things[N]
slow again.[A] War's more[N]
breakneck than I remember.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So it is.[A][N]
Well, stay safe. And I hope[N]
you see your brothers again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, lass. Probably gonna head[N]
home once I'm done 'ere.[A][N]
Ulmaron'll make for one heck[N]
of a story to tell.[A][N]
But for now, I shall take my[N]
pleasure in leisure.[A][X]

##Epilogue_SveltzalusHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSveltzalus][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're back in Holanis?[A][N]
I don't think I'll ever quite[N]
get you, Sveltzalus.[A][N]
Still, you've been just as[N]
worthy a companion as the rest.[A][N]
I truly do thank you.[A][N]
[...]Wherever you find yourself,[N]
I wish you well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleInvert]
[...][A][N][MoveMidRight]
DIRECTIVE OVERRIDE[A][N]
[...][A][N][MoveMidRight]
WHAT DO I SEEK[N]
WHAT DO I SEEK[A][X]

##Epilogue_ArtemisHolanis
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArtemis]
[...]And so I return.[A][N]
There is[...] much to be[N]
done here.[A] Much for this[N]
city to atone for.[A][N]
But[...] We shall do all in[N]
our power to atone.[A][N]
I will ensure that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
With Dalst's influence out of[N]
the picture,[A] maybe Holanis[N]
can finally truly prosper.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hope so.[A] And if not, we shall[N]
at least fail on our own demerits.[A][N]
Just as we shall rise on our merits.[N]
[...]Be well, young lady.[A][X]
