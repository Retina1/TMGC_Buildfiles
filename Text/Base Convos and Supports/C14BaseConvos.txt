Howdy, lassie![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Who're you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You haven't noticed me? But I'm the guy[N]
who keeps your battle saves safe[...][A][N]
Then again, I guess you only ever[N]
see system text nowadays.[A][N]
Blasted parchment stealing[N]
the spotlight from me.[A][N]
Anyway, the name's Jake. I'm here[N]
to tell you about my girlie, Anna.[A][N]
She runs a network of so-called[N]
Secret Shops around the world.[A][N]
There's a few here in Ulmaron, even![A][N]
Thing is, they're[...] well, secret.[N]
Not only that, but you can't just walk in.[A][N]
You'll need a shining gold member's card![N]
I think there's one in the palace[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Could you perhaps tell us[N]
where the shop is?[A][N]
If you're helping your girlfriend's business,[N]
it doesn't do good to not know where it is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Aw, fine. I'll give ya a little hint.[N]
Now, remember this well![A][N]
The shop's somewhere not reachable by foot.[N]
You'll have to swim for it![A][N]
Furthermore[...] Well, let's just say Yg'stra's[N]
not the only thing [OpenQuote]falling[CloseQuote] today.[A][N]
Well, that's all from me. I'll find you[N]
again when there's another shop nearby.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thanks?[A][X]

[...]Hello there. You're[N]
Blair, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's correct! You're one of[N]
the defectors, right?[A][N]
[...]Carbon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
In the flesh. No doubt you've[N]
heard tales of my skill.[A][N]
Have a look at this move![A][N][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wahoo![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Very[...] impressive?[N]
Not sure if it's[...] practical.[A][N]
I can't really see you hitting anything[N]
if you're flailing like that[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'm not flailing. It's[N]
a power stance.[A][N]
You know. For drawing[N]
out my power.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wait! Don't go, pretty lady![N]
I've more moves to show you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Did you just call me-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Number one! The Carbon Slide![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Number two! The Carbon Roller![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
I'll just[...] go now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Urgh[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadCarbon]
[...]There we go. I'm up.[A][N]
[...]Where'd she go?[N]
Rats. I wasn't done.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCarbon][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey]
Well, Carbon. No turning back for us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To be fair, did we ever[N]
have that luxury?[A][N]
We fight to live, and[N]
we live to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but[...] There's more[N]
to living than that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Agreed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Still[...] After everything Yg'stra's[N]
done for us[...] This hurts.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You said it yourself. This is[N]
how we end the war.[A][N]
Personally, I would've gone[N]
on living either way,[A][N]
but there's no chance in hell[N]
I'm abandoning you.[A][N]
We're dishonorable brothers-in-arms[N]
until we die.[A] Speaking of[N]
dishonor[...][A][MoveMidLeft] I snagged you[N]
a little something from the armory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Carbon. Do you really think[N]
I can use this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Are you asking for moral reasons[N]
or practical reasons?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Let's just say both.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, your sister uses axes. Sure,[N]
this thing brutalizes axe users.[A][N]
But you don't really think she'd[N]
ever fight you, right?[A][N]
As for the practicality argument[...][N]
Just stab half a dozen guys.[A][N]
You'll be a lance master in no time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I appreciate the advice.[N]
And thanks for this, in any case.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's the least I could do.[A][N]
[...]Bythewayyouowemedinnerokaybye![N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Yup. He never changes.[A][X]

##C14_Desmond_Flynn_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadDesmond]
I must say, Flynn.[N]
Your technique is marvelous.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm curious, though. Where'd you[N]
learn?[A] One of my knights knows[N]
a skill to strike twice swiftly[...][A][N]
But five times in succession?[N]
That's unheard of.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I just picked it up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Remarkable! Perhaps sometime you could[N]
come demonstrate for the recruits.[A][N]
I've never been one for swords.[N]
Always liked the heft of lances more.[A][N]
Plus, I was mostly trained to fight[N]
on horseback, and lances are ideal.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
All my lances have a story.[N]
Like my dear banner lance.[A][N]
Accidentally overbudgeted our army once.[A][N]
Had to make a battle standard by tying[N]
a stick and cloth to an axe handle.[A][N]
I'm amazed it's as functional[N]
as it is. How about you?[A][N]
Tell me about your blade.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd[...] like to hear? Well, my sword[N]
of choice is this shimmersword[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, an anti-magic sword? How[N]
intriguing! Do carry on.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I'd be glad.[A][X]

##C14_Jeff_Hilbert_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeff][OpenMidRight][LoadHilbert]
Hello there, mister![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Back off, kid. I'm not a charity.[N]
Go beg for scraps elsewhere.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd never beg, mister! I'm a[N]
hard-working hero![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, really? Then save me from having[N]
to deal with you and bug off.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Okay. Maybe I went a little far.[N]
[...]God damn it.[A][N]
Fine. What do you want?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I was wondering if you could teach[N]
me your stealin' skills![A][N]
I could learn to steal from the rich[N]
and give to the poor![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]No.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Rats.[A][X]

##C14_Cassius_Mikey_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Hey, pal. Name's Cassius.[N]
I heard you're something of a cook.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm Mikey, and[...] Well,[N]
you'd be correct.[A][N]
I don't think I'm anything[N]
all too special[...][A][N]
But I guess someone said[N]
otherwise to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, yeah. Look, after this[N]
fight, if you'd be willin'[...][A][N]
Could ya' cook me up something?[A][N]
I need salvation from army[N]
rations. No offense to them.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a bit forward, but sure.[A][N]
What're you thinking?[N]
I can make pretty much anything.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm[...] How about something[N]
meaty and rich, with a bit of spice?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll see what I can do.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, pal. What do ya' want[N]
from me in return?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll just take a round of sparring.[N]
It'd do me well to work against axes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, then. That sounds like a deal.[N]
See ya' after the battle, Mikey.[A][X]

##C14_Butch_Cassius_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCassius][OpenMidRight][LoadButch]
Hey, Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What can I do you for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Just wanted to talk.[A][N]
Say, what's the king think of us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Us? You mean our army us,[N]
or Mevion us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mevion. I'm just curious, is all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, considering he believes that[N]
you're the reason his son is dead[...][A][N]
Yeah, I don't think he likes[N]
you Mevs very much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. But still[...] Is it fair to hate[N]
a nation for the acts of a few radicals?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps not. But, hey. Can't[N]
exactly help how you feel.[A][N]
At the very least, you're a[N]
good enough fella.[A][N]
I'm sure the king'd be willing[N]
to share a word with you.[A][N]
But enough politics.[N]
How's life been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Fine enough?[A][N]
[...]You've been in the same[N]
army as me.[A][N]
You should know what we've[N]
been up to.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Just messin' with you, bud.[N]
Great talks though.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[...]What a strange man.[A][X]
