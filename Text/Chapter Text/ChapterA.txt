##ZekeArcPrimer
Welcome to the Zeke Chapters![A][N]
This short stretch of the game[N]
will focus on a smaller party.[A][N]
Don't worry: you'll unite with[N]
Blair and company soon enough.[A][N]
A few notes for Zeke's maps:[A][N]
-The convoy has been disabled.[A][N]
You'll be forced to discard items[N]
if you run out of inventory room.[A][N]
Make sure to use what you have![A][N]
Additionally, there are no shops[N]
and no chances to sell any items.[A][N]
Because of this, while your displayed[N]
gold total IS based on what Blair has,[A][N]
that won't end up mattering.[A][N]
-Until you've reunited with Blair,[N]
any unit death will be a game over.[A][N]
-For escape maps, Zeke doesn't have[N]
to be the last unit to escape.[A][N]
Good luck! I hope you've been[N]
enjoying the hack so far![A][X]

##Z1Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlexis][OpenMidRight][LoadHyperius]
Well, then. I believe we're[N]
nearly there, Alexis.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent, Sir![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Nearly where, exactly?[A][N]
You've told me little of our task[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not to offend, of course![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No, you've got a point. I apologize[N]
for keeping you in the dark so long.[A][N]
Especially since you're so inexperienced.[N]
But that's part of why I chose you.[A][N]
Despite your youth, you valiantly[N]
stood for the kingdom that day.[A][N]
I knew I needed one of your spirit[N]
for the road ahead.[A][N]
As for the task itself[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Do you recall Prince Zeke at all?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think I would've been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
four or five when he passed?[A][N]
I knew of him, but never personally,[N]
of course.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Ever since his departure[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
There's been[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] stirrings, I'll say.[A][N]
Do you recall the king's late[N]
advisor, Count Marius?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, absolutely![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Around the time of the Mevionese[N]
Revolution,[A] the man began to fear[N]
for the kingdom.[A] Far more than the[N]
king himself feared, really.[A][N]
After his passing, I found records[N]
of his indicating dealings.[A][N]
Specifically, notable sums of gold made out[N]
to a small community in Holanis.[A][N]
They began around twelve years ago,[N]
and periodically continued until he died,[A][N]
with a substantially larger sum three weeks[N]
before illness claimed him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What's all this mean, sir?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, that's what we're here to discover.[A][N][CloseEyes]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've got a theory.[N]
One that may shake the nation.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're here.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2][OpenLeft]
Pardon me, miss. I am Hyperius Galahads,[N]
envoy of Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
D-did you say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Elba Cor?[N]
Has[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] has the time come already?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Pardon?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Might I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] ask why you're here?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Certainly. I am here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] to settle loose ends.[A][N]
I've records of payments to this town,[N]
made by my colleague, the late Marius.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Y-you knew Marius? The reason[N]
this town's done well as it has?[A][N][OpenLeft]
You could say that. We both serve the crown.[N]
Might I ask the nature of these payments?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Marius had us swear to secrecy,[N]
but if he's gone, and if you knew him[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
What harm can it do now?[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Twelve years ago, a lone man[N]
arrived, bearing a young boy.[A][N]
He entrusted us with him and his identity,[N]
as well as a generous supply of gold.[A][N]
We were to protect him [OpenQuote]until such time came[N]
that he could come of age.[CloseQuote][A][N]
I believe he'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] seventeen now?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Might I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Might I have that boy's name?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've come this far and heard me out[N]
for long enough.[A][N]
His name[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is Ezekiel Johanes Courian.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
D-did you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Take us to him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
O-of course![A][X]

##Z1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHyperius][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
Pardon me. Who would you be?[N]
I don't[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You seem familiar[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
T-that hair[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's unmistakable.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Prince Zeke. I have finally[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] found you.[A][N]
I apologize for everything.[X]
//they remember each other idk
