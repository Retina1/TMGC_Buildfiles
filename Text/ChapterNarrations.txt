##Prologue_Narration
The continent of Ulmaron.[N]
A land of promise.[A][N]
Of potential.[A][N]
Of strife.[A][N]
In legend, the world[N]
was once a formless thing,[A][N]
brought into being by[N]
the creator god Opistus.[A][N]
As man developed, so too[N]
did an array of great nations.[A][N]
Central among these is Dalst,[N]
a land of eternal progress.[A][N]
Advanced in science and[N]
society alike,[A][N]
the Dalstian Alliance[N]
comprises many noble provinces,[A][N]
banded together for military[N]
and academic purposes alike.[A][N]
At the extreme northern edge[N]
of Dalst lies Aercolyn,[A][N]
a small territory which holds[N]
little influence currently,[A][N]
thanks to the disgraceful actions[N]
and subsequent exile of its lord.[A][N]
Since then, Blair,[N]
the heir to Aercolyn,[A][N]
has tirelessly worked[N]
towards restoration[A][N]
of the territory's influence,[A][N]
which has culminated[N]
in an invitation-[A][N]
one calling Blair to the[N]
Dalstian capital of Arbordia.[A][N]
Blair prepares to set off[N]
towards re-legitimizing Aercolyn,[A][N]
and thus, the threshold[N]
of fate is cast open.[A][X]
