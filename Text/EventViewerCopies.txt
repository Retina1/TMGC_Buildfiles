Have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Have we done it?[N]
Have we won?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]It appears we have.[A][N]
I believe it would be prudent to[N]
return to Arbordia,[A][N]
and report what's happened.[A][N]
With more support from Dalst, we could[N]
likely push deeper into Yg'stra.[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadLazarus]You shall report to nobody today.[A][N][MoveMidRight][Event]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Mere children took you down, Helga?[N]
How disappointing.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]A-are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] their commmander?[A][N]
Why did Yg'stra attack Dalst? What happened[N]
to those in the barracks!?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You dare question me? Do you[N]
realize your position?[A][N]
You stand before history's greatest:[N]
Lazarus, of Yg'stra![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Blair, we have to run.[A][N]
We can't possibly stand[N]
against this man now.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, you're right.[N]
There will always be another chance.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]So, you DO value your lives.[A][N]
Let's make this sporting, then. It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
satisfying, after all, if there's no struggle.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier3]Sir Lazarus! They're escaping![N]
Your orders?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Let them run. Only pursue on my orders.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]But, sir- the orders were to take as[N]
many alive as possible![A] Surely we can[N]
capture them now.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Did you mishear me?[A][N][MoveLeft][0x80][0x2D][0x88][0x8D][0x80][0x80][OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]The only orders you heed are MY direct orders.[N]
And I say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we feed them false hope.[A][N]
Young lordling[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Value whatever time[N]
you have left.[A] Know you're nothing[N]
but a stepping stone towards Elba Cor.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin][OpenMidLeft]
I believe I'm done![N]
Let us proceed.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Very well. I believe it would be in[N]
our best interest to-[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]Excuse me! Coming through![A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadArin][OpenRight][LoadRachael]
Apologies for that. Would you happen[N]
to be from Aercolyn?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] would.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Wonderful! I'm from Elba Cor,[N]
and I've a very important message.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadCassius]I'm here too! Don't forget me![A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]As I was saying, our king is sympathetic[N]
to your plight,[A] and thus would like[N]
to meet with you.[A][N]
If you need proof, I've a royal seal[N]
right here.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What do you make of this, Arin?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]I'd say this is a brilliant opportunity.[A][N]
It's certainly a better option than petitioning[N]
to a country that we just fought through.[A][N]
[OpenRight]In that case, we shall guide you to Elba Cor.[A][N][MoveRight]
My name is Rachael, of the Elba Cor[N]
pegasus knights.[A] A pleasure to[N]
meet you.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]The name's Cassius. Don't go[N]
forgetting it, alright?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]Th-thank you! Finally[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Things might be looking up.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadArin]
So, if I'm not mistaken,[N]
we're nearly to Opistia.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Quite fortunate that we haven't[N]
run into any more pirate trouble.[A][N][OpenRight]
Indeed. With any luck, we'll arrive[N]
without incident,[A] and then from[N]
there, we can meet with the Arch-[OpenFarFarLeft]
*Bang!*[N]
*Crash!*[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Cap'n! We've been struck![A][N]
Someone's shootin' us with[N]
explosive cannonballs![A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
What in the hell? Who'd be[N]
brainless enough ta fire on me?[A][N][OpenRight]
I think I see a ship over there[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Don't tell me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That flag. How did Yg'stra find us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why are they here? This is very[N]
obviously not Elba Cor![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Blast[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I can already feel her[N]
goin' down.[A] 'Twas nice knowin' ye,[N]
Tradewinds[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] No sense in cryin'[N]
over spilt ships, though.[A][N]
Gimme a moment, lass.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
What is he[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that a torch?[A][N]
Don't tell me he's joining in[N]
on the destruction[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
Aye, I'm not that mad.[N]
I was just signalin' another ship.[A][N]
When you're infamous as me, ye[N]
make some connections.[A][N]
Any pirate worth their spit'll[N]
gimme a hand, if need be.[A][N]
Lemme see what they're signalin'[N]
back at me.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarFarLeft]
*Bang!*[N]
*Crash!*[A][N][OpenFarFarRight]
Cap'n! We've been struck![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Again![A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadCid]
Aye, I know. I hear the same[N]
cannons as you dolts.[A][N]
Anyway, we be in luck, lassie.[N]
I'm owed a favor by a certain crew.[A][N]
That boat over there'll get[N]
you outta here.[A][N]
It's a small vessel, and their[N]
navigator's somethin' else.[A][N]
Once ye get near 'em, they'll[N]
open up their deck.[A][N]
It's not gonna get any easier.[N]
Go and gather yer crew.[A][X]

##I4LeilaTalkEvent
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
Who're you? Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Blue hair, noble clothing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've heard rumors of you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Didn't Elba Cor send you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's-[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]correct.[A][N]
What was that about?[A][N][X]

##C14OpenDeadValdenViewer
[OpenMidRight][LoadLazarus]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the Dalstians did you in, Valden.[N]
Damn. I was hoping to do that myself.[A][N]
Alas. At least it makes my life all[N]
the simpler.[A] I'd say I feel bad,[N]
but I don't. At all.[A][N]
You were weak, Valden.[N]
That's why you died.[A][N]
As for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Need I say more?[A][N]
I'm the strongest man in this[N]
entire fucking empire![A][N]
With the emperor as he is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
There's nobody better suited[N]
to take this throne than I.[A][N]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This is what it feels like.[N]
To be the strongest. How glorious.[A][N]
Of course, that bastard just had to[N]
get in my way one last time.[A][N]
Hid Arkhinal away and took its[N]
location to the grave. Alas.[A][N]
Maybe I'll scour the palace for it[N]
later, and take all that's mine.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course, before any of that,[N]
I've got some vengeance to partake in.[A][N]
Young lady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come and take Yg'stra[N]
from me, if you dare.[A][X]

##C14AthenaCharleyJoinViewer
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And here we are.[A][N]
I'd say this is above my pay grade,[N]
but, hey. At least it's exciting.[A][N]
Moreso than border-guarding.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can let go of me now.[N]
We're here.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadCharley]
Apologies. Never've been the[N]
most[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] comfortable flier.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If I may ask, why[N]
did you want to come along?[A][N]
Surely, you can do more personally[N]
fulfilling things than war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
For a long time, I've felt like I've[N]
wandered without a purpose.[A][N]
This might be what I've been looking[N]
for all this time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. Enough talking. The lady's[N]
party should be nearby.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. It's all up to us.[A][X]

##Z3Ending4Viewer
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBrandl][OpenFarRight][LoadHyperius][OpenMidLeft]
Hyperius! Where on Ulmaron[N]
have you been?[A][N]
You had disappeared right as[N]
the invasion mounted[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Had me worried sick that[N]
some Yg'stran got to you![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Apologies, your majesty. I had[N]
business I was long planning.[A][N]
I at least trust that the knights[N]
did a suitable job in my absence?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, the war's over, and we're[N]
still standing.[A] Any man would[N]
call that admirable.[A][N]
Pray tell, what was this[N]
business of yours, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Father? Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
W-what matter[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What kind of c-cruel[N]
apparation is this, H-Hyperius?[A][N]
Who i-is this impostor[N]
in f-front of me?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Unbelievable as it is, your[N]
majesty, it is no jest.[A][N]
It is your son. Ezekiel Johanes Courian.[N]
Alive and well.[A][N][OpenRight]
You must have many questions[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]More than I, at least.[A][N]
But I-I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][CloseEyes][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] so glad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
to see you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
I-It's really[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] son[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] alive.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I shall[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] leave you two.[N]
I ought to see off our allies.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Why not invite them to stay?[A][N]
We must thank them for their[N]
assistance,[A] and how better to[N]
do that than a grand feast?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. Is that quite alright,[N]
your majesty?[N][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For the first time in a long time,[N]
Hyperius[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] All is quite alright.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Very well.[A][N][CloseEyes]
([ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You'd be proud if you were[N]
still here, Marius.)[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadAlexis][OpenRight][LoadLeila][OpenLeft][LoadAvan][OpenFarLeft][LoadToddsworth]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Where's our reward?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Now's not the time, Todd.[A][N][OpenRight]
Honestly, I'm with Todd on this one.[N]
I wouldn't mind ducking and running.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Nonsense! You're all heroes now![A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadDamien]
Heroes? Huh. Not a bad deal.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]On second thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] People throw themselves[N]
at a good hero, right?[A][N]
Watch out, everyone.[N]
Toddsworth's getting some action.[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadZacharias]
Be silent.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
In any case, I feel we might be[N]
stuck together a while longer.[A][N]
But, hey. I'm always down for[N]
an adventure with[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, we're not strangers, anymore.[N]
How about friends?[A][N][OpenRight][ClearFace][LoadLeila]
I'll go as far as acquaintances.[A][N][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadAvan]
The Royal Acquaintances[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I like that.[N]
Has a comfy feel to it.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadHyperius]
Everyone. The king thanks you for your deeds.[A][N]
You're all invited to remain in the[N]
city for as long as you'd like.[A][N]
There will be a grand reception upon the[N]
return of our Dalstian allies.[A][N]
The kingdom[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is in your debt.[A][X]

##Ch15_OpeningViewer
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadZeke][OpenFarRight][LoadElcorian]
So, you must be the young prince.[N]
It is good to see you well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Forgive my rudeness. I am Elcorian.[N]
A[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] peer of Blair's.[A][N][OpenRight]
It's nice to meet you.[A][N]
Did you need Lady Blair? I was[N]
just speaking with her.[A][N]
After all, my father had come to[N]
her aid.[A] Only feels right to[N]
get to know her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'll be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nice, having an[N]
ally in Elba Cor.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Of course. On the subject of allies,[A][N]
I believe that once we're all returned[N]
to Dalst, the High Council may convene.[A][N]
I trust you can guess for what purpose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that true? That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] fantastic![A][N][OpenFarRight]
After all, Aercolyn's actions brought the[N]
war to a speedy end,[A] even if Elba Cor[N]
and Opistia's hands weighed the scales.[A][N]
Of course, these Opistus-forsaken postwar[N]
roundtables must come to an end.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
Hey, it's not my fault Yg'stra's all[N]
Dalst's problem now.[A][OpenEyes] Though I[N]
appreciate my not having to deal with it.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
If we're pinning this on anybody, it's[N]
Tarquin. I mean, Lord Neillstrom.[A][N]
And yet I'm the one drowning in paperwork.[A][N][OpenRight]
Alas. At least soon enough,[N]
this war will be behi-[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier1]
Your highness![A][N][OpenRight]
What's the matter?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
A mysterious figure has appeared outside[N]
of the castle grounds![A][N]
They appear to be warping a legion[N]
of soldiers beyond the gate![A][N][OpenRight]
What do you mean?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Warping soldiers. That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
can't be good at all.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Come quickly, please![A][X]

##Ch18_OpeningViewer
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
If I'm reading this map correctly,[N]
we should be nearing northern Holanis.[A][N]
From there, we'll be a stone's[N]
throw from the Aqueduct.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I must say, it's getting[N]
rather dark and dreary.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That it is.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Say.[N]
I've been thinking.[A][N]
Lately, I mean.[A][N]
Am I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] worthy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Worthy? Of what?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, all of this.[N]
Leading us into war.[A][N]
Having a crown on my head.[N]
Everything I've recently gained.[A][N]
When all I've done my whole life is[N]
while away at the edge of the world.[A][N][CloseEyes]
Am I to believe that I'm the future[N]
of Elba Cor,[A] just because I was[N]
lucky enough to be born that future?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't think I can give[N]
you a satisfying answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
It's alright. I know it's a lot.[N]
I just can't shake it from my mind.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
In any case, you've been invaluable.[A][N]
Ever since you joined our forces,[N]
it's like a weight has been lifted.[A][N][CloseEyes]
The war with Yg'stra[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It constantly felt[N]
like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was drowning.[A][N]
Like the world was closing in on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Good people fell on my watch.[A][N]
And I felt I had to burden myself[N]
with it all. For the army's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Apologies for pouring that out.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's alright. It does us well[N]
to speak our minds.[A][N][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBaddie1]
How touchin'. It'll also do ye[N]
well ta die, ye' rats![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
I think[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] it's over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have we done[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[N]
The Archbishop[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] said himself. It was his choice.[N]
There's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] structure in place.[A][N]
It's tragic, but we can't falter.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Given the trials[N]
of our recent battles,[A][N]
it may be worth making camp for[N]
a few days.[A] There should be a[N]
clearing not too far from here.[A][N]
We'll rest and regroup, and proceed[N]
to the Aqueduct from there.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Alright. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
need a moment.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. He was a[N]
truly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wondrous man.[A][N]
Do what you feel you must.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

##V2Opening2Viewer
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFreddric][OpenLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadElcorian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you must be Viridian.[N]
I am Elcorian.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I take it from this that[N]
you're interested in my offer?[A][N][OpenLeft]
That would be correct.[A][N]
What might the nature of this[N]
job be, exactly?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Simply put, we're experiencing some[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
civil unrest.[A] Our army is unfortunately[N]
occupied dealing with Yg'stra.[A][N]
Thus, rather than wait and[N]
risk the lives of our citizenry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
You're hiring mercenaries.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Exactly. Good to see[N]
you catch on quick.[A][N]
There appears to be some kind of[N]
man leading this rebellion,[A][N]
and I'd imagine felling him would[N]
be enough to quell it for now.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I see. And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] if I may ask[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That sword you're concealing at your hip.[N]
Are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] proficient in combat?[A][N]
If so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why do I not fight myself?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps once I was skilled.[N]
But now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I'm a man of science.[N]
I can[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] hardly fight.[A][N]
And I'd rather not risk my[N]
ideas be lost forever.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Suppose that contradicts your whole[N]
[OpenQuote]for the people[CloseQuote] ideology.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hardly. I was just curious.[A][N]
To the comman man, raising your[N]
blade in their defense is,[A][N]
for all intents and purposes,[A][N]
the same as raising your pen[N]
to sign a merc contract.[A][N]
Perhaps there's an element of cowardice.[A][N]
But at the end of the day, someone's[N]
fighting for the people's sake.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you in, then?[A][N]
If so, here's your down payment.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Very well.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Keep it, for now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
How do you mean?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, we ought to prove ourselves[N]
before being trusted with that sum.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I shall await results.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What a bizarre man.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hardly different from the nobles[N]
we've fought for in the past.[A][N]
Though, that's the thing.[A][N]
He doesn't strike me as noble.[N]
Just who is he, anyway?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
In any case, I believe our target[N]
is further north.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Then, we march.[A][X]
