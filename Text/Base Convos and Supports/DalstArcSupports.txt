But[...] I've learned that we can't[N]
get caught up on the dead.[A][N]
After all[...] The rest of us[N]
are still alive.[A][N]
We've still got many who rely[N]
on the two of us.[A][N]
[...]Maybe this isn't really[N]
helping.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see where you're coming[N]
from.[A] I think we all just[...][N]
need time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course.[A][X]

Even more fighting[...] It's[N]
so tiring, Carbon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah.[A][N]
Once we're back home, I'm retiring[N]
at the ripe old age of seventeen.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Actually, on that note[...][N]
What WERE you gonna do?[A][N]
In general, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never got a chance to really[N]
think about that.[A][N]
Knowing our country, I'd be doing[N]
military stuff for the rest of time.[A][N]
Doesn't appeal much to me, now.[A][N]
So I'm kinda glad this whole mess[N]
happened. Gives us another chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a way to look at it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Every last one of us has had[N]
our fill of fighting, I'm sure.[A][N]
I wanna enjoy life a bit.[N]
Do some wacky Carbon-y things.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Guess we gotta work for our happiness.[N]
It's worth it, though.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. You're right, pal.[A][X]

[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Did you know of this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I did not. And still[...][N]
To think of this happening[...][A][N]
All in my homeland.[N]
It's shameful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You can still right it.[N]
This is your home, right?[A][N]
A true knight fights for[N]
their homeland.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]But what if the powers that[N]
be chose this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd still fight for your home.[N]
Just[...] for a better future for it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
[...]Quite insightful, for[N]
somebody so young.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
If I saw Elba Cor turn astray,[N]
I'd do all I could to save it.[A][N]
Sir Hyperius[...] He showed me that[N]
there's a difference.[A][N]
Between what a country wants[N]
and what a country needs.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Well, then. Can't go letting[N]
you down.[A] I'll make a just[N]
future for Holanis.[A][N]
Even if it hurts in the now.[A][X]

Heya, Leila.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Do you have more idiotic[N]
schemes like last time?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nah. Not enough space in here[N]
to make my pegasus idea work.[A][N]
Besides, you didn't seem to[N]
like it.[A] Not gonna bring up[N]
somethin' you don't like again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Huh.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey. I can be serious.[N]
[...]Not good at it.[A][N]
But I sure can be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Good for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for ya' to be cold.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Wouldn't hurt to smile.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]That's all you get.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That'll do.[A][X]

##CassiusMikeyBSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Say, Mikey. What's the most[N]
delicious thing you can make?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's a tough one.[N]
Taste's subjective.[A][N]
I know you're quite the[N]
fan of meats[...][A][N]
Especially the smoked variety.[A][N]
So to you, that's probably[N]
the best meal I can produce.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. What's YOUR favorite, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I'd have to go with[N]
this particular stew.[A][N]
My father used to make it[...][N]
It's nothing too special.[A][N]
But at the same time, it's[N]
everything it needs to be.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Could never make it[N]
quite how he could.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sounds tasty. I'm sure you[N]
could do it justice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Perhaps. It's been some time[N]
since I've last made it.[A][N]
But it'd do me good.[A][N]
And I know you. You'll eat[N]
anything I make anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're probably right there.[A][N]
I'd trust you to make a[N]
plate of rocks taste good.[A][X]

[...]Well, now's as good a[N]
time as any.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You got me swingin' axes.[N]
Only fair I pay you back.[A][N]
[...]This is a healing staff.[N]
It heals people.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see. I know you said[N]
you're not good at this.[A][N]
Teaching things, I mean.[A][N]
And healing seems really[N]
complicated.[A][N]
I can always just ask[N]
Blair to show me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Trust me. This means a lot[N]
to little ol' me.[A][N]
[...]You've served as good stress[N]
relief, and as a good friend.[A][N]
The least I can do is stretch[N]
myself a bit to help you out.[A][N]
Besides, this'll help you keep[N]
anyone else you care about safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well[...] I can't go denying[N]
you now, can I?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]As I was saying, this is a[N]
staff.[A] It's sorta like an axe.[N]
Long wooden shaft. Object on top.[A][N]
They're fickle little bastards, though.[N]
Gotta grip them like so.[A][N]
Else, their magic just won't work.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see, I see.[A][N]
I've seen you use that[N]
a lot. Let me try.[A][N][MoveRight]
[...]So, do I just grab it like[N]
this and wave it around?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's a bit more complex.[N]
[...]But that'll do for now.[A][N]
You're a quick learner.[N]
You'll figure it out.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me,[A][N]
I think that guy over there's[N]
just asking to be bonked.[A][X]
