If you're going to make new skills, there's a bunch of stuff you need to do.
First, make sure it assembles correctly. Errors are bad, so fix them.
After that, add your skill to an appropiate place in the Skills folder.
A skill definition is important too, and that file doubles as the big skill list.
If your skill's up and running, stick a big //DONE next to it.
Giving your skill an icon and description won't stop it from working, but it won't look quite so nice without it.
Otherwise, you'll get a glitchy icon and placeholder text.
Don't forget to edit the skill description event file so the game can see your description.
If all goes well, your skill should function in the game!

1: Player Only
2: Enemy Only
