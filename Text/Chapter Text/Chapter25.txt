[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Samantha. I presume you[N]
understand why I'm here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] rather not fight you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, well. Arbordia willed it so.[N]
And this is Barford's chance.[A][N]
Every one of your siblings has[N]
failed our house.[A][N][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You can still come back.[N]
There's a place for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] can't. Not[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
after this.[A][N]
I've[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] grown, Brother.[N]
If I must, I'll face you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Perhaps your leaving was[N]
what you needed, after all.[A][N]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] glad for you. And glad[N]
I got to see you again.[A][N]
I see you use the bow.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Good choice.[A][N]
Guess it runs in the family.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've carried this around far too long.[A][N]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a keepsake of Father's.[A][N]
He gave it to me years back.[N]
But I've never used it.[A][N]
Did I want to prove myself[N]
on my own terms? Perhaps.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]In any case[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You might[N]
as well have it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Come. It's time to fulfill[N]
our duties, Sister.[A][N]
Prove to me your new resolve![A][X]
