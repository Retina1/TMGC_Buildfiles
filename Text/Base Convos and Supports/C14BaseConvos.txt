[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Hello there. You're[N]
Blair, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's correct! You're one of[N]
the defectors, right?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Carbon?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
In the flesh. No doubt you've[N]
heard tales of my skill.[A][N]
Have a look at this move![A][N][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Wahoo![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] impressive?[N]
Not sure if it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] practical.[A][N]
I can't really see you hitting anything[N]
if you're flailing like that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm not flailing. It's[N]
a power stance.[A][N]
You know. For drawing[N]
out my power.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wait! Don't go, pretty lady![N]
I've more moves to show you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Did you just call me-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Number one! The Carbon Slide![A][N][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]
Number two! The Carbon Roller![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
I'll just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] go now.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Urgh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadCarbon]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There we go. I'm up.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Where'd she go?[N]

Well, Carbon. No turning back for us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To be fair, did we ever[N]
have that luxury?[A][N]
We fight to live, and[N]
we live to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] There's more[N]
to living than that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Agree.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] After everything Yg'stra's[N]
done for us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This hurts.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You said it yourself. This is[N]
how we end the war.[A][N]
Personally, I would've gone[N]
on living either way,[A][N]
but there's no chance in hell[N]
I'm abandoning you.[A][N]
We're dishonorable brothers-in-arms[N]
until we die.[A] Speaking of[N]
dishonor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][MoveMidLeft] I snagged you[N]
a little something from the armory.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Carbon. Do you really think[N]
I can use this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are you asking for moral reasons[N]
or practical reasons?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Let's just say both.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sure, your sister uses axes. Sure,[N]
this thing brutalizes axe users.[A][N]
But you don't really think she'd[N]
ever fight you, right?[A][N]
As for the practicality argument[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Just stab half a dozen guys.[A][N]
You'll be a lance master in no time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I appreciate the advice.[N]
And thanks for this, in any case.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's the least I could do.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Bythewayyouowemedinnerokaybye[N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yup. He never changes.[A][X]

Hey, Cassius.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What can I do you for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just wanted to talk.[A][N]
Say, what's the king think of us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Us? You mean our army us,[N]
or Mevion us?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mevion. I'm just curious, is all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, considering he believes that[N]
you're the reason his son is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Yeah, I don't think he likes[N]
you Mevs very much.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. But still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Is it fair to hate[N]
a nation for the acts of a few radicals?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps not. But, hey. Can't[N]
exactly help how you feel.[A][N]
At the very least, you're a[N]
good enough fella.[A][N]
I'm sure the king'd be willing[N]
to share a word with you.[A][N]
But enough politics.[N]
How's life been?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine enough?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You've been in the same[N]
army as me.[A][N]
You should know what we've[N]
been up to.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Great talks though.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What a strange man.[A][X]
