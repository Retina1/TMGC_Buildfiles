##_V3Seize
Open all doors,[N]
then seize.[X]

##V3ScrollText
Unlock the doors to free prisoners.[A][N]
To complete the map, unlock every[N]
door, then seize the throne.[A][X]

##V3_Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're nearly at the location[N]
Neillstrom gave us.[A][N]
Let us hope it's accurate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate, that we[N]
have to come to blows.[A][N]
It almost feels wrong to put[N]
down freedom fighters like this.[A][N]
But at the same time[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Holding prisoners like this[N]
is simply unjustifiable.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We're doing this for them.[N]
Not for Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And if Dalst was lying?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, obviously we'd turn around[N]
and ask what the hell is going on.[A][N]
In any case, we signed a contract.[N]
And now it's our duty.[A][N]
After this, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I wanna get[N]
away from nobility.[A][N]
Return to our roots.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm glad to hear that.[A][X]

##V3_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
Reynard! We've got company below![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hmph. So we do. If they're here,[N]
they're here for the prisoners.[A][N]
Well, then. We'll spring them a[N]
nice ol' trap, I say.[A][N]
First thing's first. Let me[N]
get in position.[A][X]

##V3_Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadReynard][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2][OpenMidLeft]
What was I sayin'? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][N]
As they free the prisoners,[N]
spring our men on them.[A][N]
We'll not bow down to Dalst[N]
until they recognize us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Keep yourself alive,[N]
captain.[A] You're the heart[N]
of this resistance.[A][X]

##V3_Opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian][OpenMidRight][LoadFreddric][OpenMidLeft]
Remember, everyone! Our goal's[N]
to free the prisoners![A][N]
If you see a camp gate and[N]
have a key, crack it open![A][N]
Only once we've freed everyone[N]
should we seize their main building.[A][N]
Wilhelm's squad should be[N]
converging shortly.[A][N]
And remember, it's getting dark.[N]
Keep your wits about you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They haven't quite noticed[N]
our presence yet.[A][N]
If we need to shift our formation,[N]
I can carry people over the river.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. We'll send[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
five on each side.[A][N]
Get ready, friends. Today,[N]
we fight for freedom![A][X]

##V3_Arrival
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArgent][OpenRight][LoadWilhelm][OpenFarRight][LoadManfred][OpenMidLeft]
Hold. I believe we're here.[A][N][OpenRight]
Yup. That's an ecampment.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And that's a guy who's[N]
lookin' like he'll stab me.[A][N]
Well, remember the plan.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Isn't the plan just [OpenQuote]don't die[CloseQuote]?[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
It's a damn fine plan, Manfred.[A][N]
I'd bet my life on it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've had more than my fill of life.[N]
I'll be your shield, gentlemen.[A][N][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Gentle? That's a stretch.[N]
For both of us.[A][N]
And we can hold our own.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Especially with the looming[N]
promise of payday.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
We'll be alright, Argent.[N]
Keep yourself alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of course. Let our[N]
deeds be remembered.[A][N][OpenRight]
That's the spirit.[A][N]
Though, hopefully by tonight[N]
I'll have forgotten them,[A][N]
and it'll just be me, a nice[N]
bottle, and a stack of cards.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Just make sure to save some[N]
for me, friend.[A][X]

##V3_DoorsRemain
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What am I doing? There's[N]
still work to be done[A][X]

##V3_NoDoorsRemain
[OpenMidLeft][LoadViridian]
I think we got everyone.[N]
Now, let's wrap this up.[A][X]
