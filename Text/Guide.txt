##GuideMovementSkillsDesc
All infantry classes have[N]
Shove. Heroes, Swordmasters,[N]
and Assassins have Swap.[N]
Snipers, Assassins,[N]
and Generals have Pivot.[N]
Halberdiers have[N]
Reposition. Warriors,[N]
Berserkers, and[N]
Generals have Smite.[N]
Certain units may also get[N]
these, plus the skill Swarp,[N]
as personal skills.[N]
Hopefully, this will help[N]
non-staff infantry contribute[N]
when the game inevitably[N]
devolves into skips.[X]

##GuideChanges
Basic Changes[X]

##GuideChangesDesc
Skill and item descriptions[N]
that refer to modifying Prt[N]
will impact Def/Res in combat.[N][N]
Weapon triangle is now[N]
+/-2 Mt and +/-10 Hit.[N]
Additionally, S Ranks now[N]
give +3 might and +10 hit.[N][N]
When a weapon deals effective[N]
damage, the user gets +20 hit.[N][N]
Mounted units have a universal[N]
20 aid, regardless of their[N]
own constitution stat.[N][N]
The crit formula is Skill-10.[N]
Red unit crit from skill is[N]
scaled by 66%, rounded down.[N][N]
The battle preparations shop[N]
will upgrade its inventory[N]
several times during the game.[N]
Keep an eye out for that.[N][N]
Stealing now doesn't have any[N]
speed requirements - thieves[N]
can steal from enemies of[N]
any speed, FE6 style.[N][N]
Aura skills with identical[N]
names do not stack.[N]
If a unit gets two copies of[N]
the same skill, they also[N]
do not stack.[N][N]
Terrain now always gives an[N]
equal boost to Defense and[N]
Resistance.[N][N]
Supports have been completely[N]
reworked, though bonuses[N]
are still based on proximity.[N][N]
Many weapons have significantly[N]
higher stats than vanilla.[N][N]
Enemies get +5 hit on Hard,[N]
and +10 hit on Lunatic.[N]
Additionally, enemies (including[N]
recruitables) get HMB.[N][N]
A unit's items are sent to the[N]
convoy upon their death.[N]
Note that this only applies[N]
to blue units.[N][N]
Magic weapons do not grant[N]
WEXP, but combat staves do.[N][N]
Check the statscreen for info[N]
on learned skills. (Promo)[N]
means a skill is learnt upon[N]
promotion. A number represents[N]
what level is needed to learn[N]
that skill. A + means the unit[N]
must be that level in a[N]
promoted class. If a skill is[N]
skipped (ex. promoting before[N]
learning a (15) skill), it's[N]
gone forever![X]

##GuideBase
Base and Supports[X]

##GuideBaseDesc
During battle preparations,[N]
Base Conversations can be[N]
read. They provide a wealth[N]
of benefits, and a wealth of[N]
lore. Convos marked with !!![N]
grant concrete benefits,[N]
such as items and units.[N]
Convos marked with !![N]
contain valuable gameplay hints,[N]
such as mechanic overviews[N]
and map gimmicks.[N]
Convos marked with ![N]
are unimportant beyond[N]
providing some flavor[N]
and worldbuilding.[N]
Convos with no ! displayed[N]
will instead be formatted as[N]
[OpenQuote]___ and ___[CloseQuote].[N]
These are supports.[N]
Activating a support will[N]
increase that pair's support[N]
rank. Prior supports must have[N]
been activated earlier in[N]
the game (ex. you must have[N]
gotten Blair/Arin C to be able[N]
to activate Blair/Arin C+).[N]
There are 5 support ranks-[N]
C, C+, B, B+, and A.[N]
A unit can have 5 supports,[N]
with no limit on ranks.[N]
Support bonuses are determined[N]
on a pair-by-pair and[N]
rank-by-rank basis- affinity[N]
doesn't exist anymore.[N]
Not every pair will always be[N]
able to reach an A rank -[N]
some pairs only go so far.[N]
Also, romantic A supports are[N]
typically mutually exclusive -[N]
characters usually cannot have[N]
multiple lovers.[N]
Romantic A supports will also[N]
be marked with !!!!, so you[N]
know what you're getting into.[N]
Sometimes, it may also be[N]
possible to improve support[N]
rank via talk conversations.[N]
If one of these talks doesn't[N]
seem to increase support ranks,[N]
it's probably because one of[N]
the involved members has[N]
already obtained 5 supports.[N]
Note that supports aren't wiped[N]
out when a unit dies.[X]

##GuideSpecial
Special Mechanics[X]

##GuideSpecialDesc
Savepoints: Suspend no longer[N]
exists, and the game will not[N]
autosave upon reset![N]
Instead, you can save mid-map[N]
at marked save points, one time[N]
per save point per map.[N]
Saving doesn't consume the turn[N]
of the user, and saves will[N]
last until you either complete[N]
the chapter or load a full save.[N][N]
Fog of War: Torch items no[N]
longer exist, and thieves[N]
do not have bonus vision.[N]
Rather, all extra vision is[N]
granted through map torches,[N]
which function similar to[N]
their Tellius incarnation.[N]
Move next to a torch and[N]
use the appropriate menu[N]
command to light it.[N]
Be warned that certain[N]
events can be triggered[N]
by torchlight.[N][N]
Escape Maps: In escape maps,[N]
Blair must be the last unit[N]
to escape. If you can't escape[N]
for whatever reason, make sure[N]
she's not carrying anybody.[N][N]
Weapon Type Icons: Effective[N]
weapon descriptions have[N]
icons indicating what[N]
movement/weapon type they[N]
are effective against.[N]
Generally, effectives[N]
good against specific weapons[N]
are only effective based[N]
on a class's main weapon-[N]
ex. a Sword General only[N]
takes effective damage from[N]
anti-sword weapons despite[N]
also having axes and bows.[N][N]
Green Units: Unless otherwise[N]
stated, there are no rewards[N]
or penalties for the survival[N]
of unrecruitable green units.[N][N]
Item Indicators: A flashing green[N]
bag icon on an enemy indicates[N]
that it drops an item on death.[N]
A flashing brown bag icon[N]
indicates a stealable item,[N]
such as a gemstone or[N]
stat boosting item.[N]
If both a green and brown[N]
bag are visible, the enemy[N]
has both a stealable and[N]
a droppable.[N][N]
Skill Scrolls: These items[N]
teach the respective skill[N]
when used. Note that if used[N]
during a map and you already[N]
have 4 level-up/scroll based[N]
skills, you will be prompted[N]
to forget a skill. This menu[N]
will NOT appear if you use[N]
a scroll in preps with all[N]
4 learn slots filled - the[N]
scroll will be lost with no[N]
effect. Apologies for this,[N]
but be careful using scrolls![N][N]
If there are any other[N]
mechanics I have forgotten[N]
to elaborate on, send in[N]
feedback and let me know![X]

##GuideShopHints

This guide section lists various[N]
important items from shops[N]
throughout the game, as to help[N]
you make more informed decisions.[N]

##GuidePandora
Pandora[X]

##GuidePandoraDesc
By this point, you may have[N]
recruited a Pandora.[N]
This unit functions similarly[N]
to Xane from Archanea.[N]
By moving next to an ally,[N]
they can copy them.[N][N]
When a Pandora copies a unit,[N]
Max HP, Str, Mag, Skl, Spd,[N]
Luck, Def, Res, Movement[N]
(including boosts from Boots!),[N]
all weapon ranks, and class[N]
skills (like Canto, Cunning,[N]
Perform, and Crit Boost) are[N]
copied onto the Pandora,[N]
and their class is temporarily[N]
changed to match the target.[N]
Their constitution value is[N]
set to the class base (seen[N]
on generic enemies) plus any[N]
bonuses from the Pandora[N]
using Body Rings and the like.[N]
Transforming doesn't heal the[N]
Pandora, so it may be worthwhile[N]
investing in them to increase[N]
their untransformed HP.[N]
The Pandora will also not[N]
gain any of the target's[N]
personal/level-up skills,[N]
nor their ability to use[N]
any character-based PRFs.[N]
However, any skills innate to[N]
the Pandora (such as their[N]
base Nullify) DO carry over[N]
when they transform, as do[N]
skills learned via level-up[N]
or skill scrolls.[N][N]
A Pandora will revert to their[N]
original form after five turns.[N]
(Ex. Transform on turn 1,[N]
revert at the start of turn 6.)[N]
No experience is gained while[N]
transforming, and while you can[N]
use statboosters on and even[N]
promote a transformed Pandora,[N]
it is generally ill-advised,[N]
as all effects will be lost[N]
once the Pandora reverts.[N]
The Pandora's stats will be reset[N]
to their initial state, and the[N]
Pandora can transform again[N]
without any cooldown.[N][N]
Apologies for the length of[N]
this explanation, but there's[N]
a lot to cover. If I missed[N]
any details, send in some[N]
feedback and let me know![X]

##GuideEarthPower
Earth Power[X]

##GuideEarthPowerDesc
This section lists the effects[N]
of every anima tome empowered[N]
by the Earth Power held item.[N]
Effects will also appear in[N]
the tome's R-text while[N]
Earth Power is held.[N]
If something somehow counts as[N]
anima and is not on this list,[N]
it will grant the user +40 to[N]
Hit/Avoid/Crit/Crit Avoid.[N]
Fire: +30 AS/Avoid.[N]
Thunder: Gains the brave effect.[N]
Elfire: +20 damage to mounts.[N]
Fimbulvetr: +8 Prt.[N]
Flare: +100 Crit against foes[N]
with full HP.[N]
Starfall: User's AS is set to[N]
equal their speed stat, and[N]
user's Def/Res/Prt are set to 0.[N]
Calibur: +60 Crit.[N]
Inversion: Weapon triangle dmg[N]
has an additional x16 multiplier.[N]
Hit has an additional x4.[N]
Galewind: Grants an additional[N]
hit after each strike in battle.[N]
Sagittae: +15 damage, the user[N]
targets Def instead of Res.[N]
Bolting: Pierce resistance.[N]
Cloudburst: +80 Avo.[N]
Trisagion: +50 Atk/AS during[N]
extra turns granted by the[N]
Press Turn effect.[N]
Force Spike: After attacking, user[N]
gets a temporary +15 Res[N]
(as if they drank a stronger[N]
Pure Water) that fades just[N]
as a Barrier/Pure Water would.[N]
Mazandyne: +40 Hit, WT damage[N]
has an additional x16 multiplier.[N]
Hit has an additional x4.[N]
Awaken: Attack multiplied by 1.5[N]
while in Resolve range.[N]
Waning: +100 Prt if foe is[N]
at >50% HP when combat begins.[X]

##GuideAercolyn
Aercolyn[X]

##GuideAercolynDesc
A territory at the north[N]
tip of the Dalstian Alliance.[N]
Some time ago, the previous lord[N]
of Aercolyn, Blair's father,[N]
committed acts ruled to be[N]
high treason by Dalst,[N]
and was subsequently exiled[N]
while the territory's influence[N]
over Dalstian politics was[N]
rapidly diminished.[N][N]
Currently, the state operates[N]
independently under the rule[N]
of Blair's advisors,[N]
with a distinct military from[N]
the Allied Dalstian Army.[X]

##GuideDalst
Dalst[X]

##GuideDalstDesc
An alliance of noble territories,[N]
whose most noteworthy export[N]
is knowledge and magical talent.[N]
Notable houses include Neillstrom,[N]
who provides the single largest[N]
contribution to the nation's army,[N]
Ciraweiss, who's known for their[N]
agricultural contributions[N]
(most notably a tender wood[N]
used in most staves), and[N]
Arbordia, a central territory[N]
used as the nation's capital.[X]

##GuideMevion
Mevion[X]

##GuideMevionDesc
A swampy land once ruled[N]
by a monarchy, currently[N]
ruled by a democracy.[N]
Following the crowning of[N]
the final king, and his[N]
numerous unpopular decisions[N]
(including an exorbitant[N]
taxation increase), a[N]
revolution swept the land.[N]
What resulted from a bloody[N]
civil war was Ulmaron's first[N]
land run by election.[N]
Since then, the state has[N]
remained relatively isolated[N]
from the affairs of other[N]
nations, with a relatively[N]
hostile stance towards those[N]
who seek to potentially[N]
drag Mevion into conflict.[X]

##GuideYgstra
Yg'stra[X]

##GuideYgstraDesc
A rough and arid land ruled[N]
by an emperor. Said emperor is[N]
determined through a massive[N]
combat tournament, and many[N]
positions in the Yg'stran chain[N]
of command are also decided on[N]
combat merit. They hold limited[N]
influence in the Lowlands, and[N]
otherwise the [OpenQuote]empire[CloseQuote] is[N]
largely restricted to Eastern[N]
Ulmaron. Much of the structure[N]
of Yg'stra is a remnant of the[N]
olden days, when they were[N]
hellbent on conquest; in modern[N]
times, they're relatively neutral.[X]

##GuideElbaCor
Elba Cor[X]

##GuideElbaCorDesc
A mountainous kingdom ruled[N]
by a long-lasting monarchy.[N]
Elba Cor and the old Mevionese[N]
kingdom were founded a mere[N]
6 years apart, and Elba Cor's[N]
founding year is often used[N]
as a baseline for the entire[N]
continent. Around the same[N]
time as the Mevionese Revolution,[N]
Elba Cor's prince Zeke was[N]
presumably assassinated,[N]
and the populace was quick[N]
to blame Mevion. As a result[N]
of this, as well as Aercolyn's[N]
fall from grace, Elba Cor's[N]
longtime alliances with Mevion[N]
and Dalst have largely faded.[X]

##GuideOpistia
Opistia[X]

##GuideOpistiaDesc
A desert land ruled by[N]
the Opistian Church.[N]
Its capital, Opistinia, was[N]
built around an ancient oasis,[N]
which, much like many other[N]
Opistinian landmarks, is seen[N]
as a great blessing.[N]
One of Opistia's oldest landmarks[N]
is the manmade Tower of Opistia,[N]
built to honor Opistus.[N]
In relatively recent years,[N]
the tower was expanded into[N]
something of a space elevator[N]
through a collaborative effort[N]
with Dalst, and since then,[N]
the two nations have become[N]
unlikely allies.[X]

##GuideHolanis
Holanis[X]

##GuideHolanisDesc
A barren land that was once[N]
host to a grand kingdom.[N]
Almost no records of the[N]
civilazation remain, and[N]
even how it fell is a mystery.[N]
What remains is some truly[N]
fascinating ruined architecture,[N]
and a landscape warped by[N]
unimaginable forces.[N]
In recent times, settlers have[N]
started to return to Holanis,[N]
with the most notable group[N]
creating the city of Gohranos,[N]
which aims to be the capital[N]
of a new Holanian Republic.[X]

##GuideLowlands
Lowlands[X]

##GuideLowlandsDesc
The ashlands that run through[N]
the center of Ulmaron.[N]
Thanks to Mt. Loile's continual[N]
spurts of ash and dust,[N]
much of the Lowlands is a[N]
barely livable wasteland.[N]
As such, most nations have[N]
given up on attempts to expand[N]
into it, with the exception[N]
of Yg'stra. Still, those who[N]
choose to - or are forced to -[N]
live in the Lowlands often[N]
resort to lives of banditry[N]
and scavenging. The ashes also[N]
expand downward into Holanis,[N]
but superstitions over the[N]
ancient fall of Holanis drive[N]
away all but the most tempered[N]
wills from these southern[N]
Lowlands.[X]

##GuideLoile
Mt. Loile[X]

##GuideLoileDesc
A volcano located north of[N]
Elba Cor. It erupts on a yearly[N]
basis, and almost constantly[N]
unleashes ashes that coat[N]
the Lowlands. The eruptions[N]
themselves are generally minor[N]
and pose little direct threat to[N]
Elba Cor, let alone any other[N]
great nation. Some decide to[N]
live alongside the volcano[N]
in ancient ruins dotting[N]
the surrounding wastes.[N]
The purpose of these ruins[N]
is unclear, but scholars[N]
theorize that Loile was once[N]
a normal mountain at the tip[N]
of the Elba Corian mountain[N]
range, and that perhaps the[N]
ruins are from a civilization[N]
of that bygone era.[X]

##GuideBlairDesc
Blair von Aercolyn[N]
Homeland: Aercolyn[N]
Age: 17[N]
Likes: Companions, warm drinks[N]
Dislikes: Loss, condescension[N]
Occupation: Lord of Aercolyn[N]
She/They[N][N]
The lord of Aercolyn,[N]
and the heroine of this story.[N]
She's young and posesses a[N]
strong sense of justice,[N]
as well as a strong desire[N]
to prove herself. Thanks to[N]
her relative inexperience,[N]
she can also be rather naive.[N][N]
At a young age, her father,[N]
the former lord of Aercolyn,[N]
was exiled for reasons kept[N]
secret to all but the most[N]
elite Dalstian nobles.[N]
It was declared that when[N]
she came of age and fully[N]
took control of her state,[N]
she would be given a chance[N]
to prove her allegiance.[N]
Eventually, she attended[N]
the Northern Arbordia[N]
Academy, where she met Arin,[N]
who'd become something[N]
of an unofficial vassal.[N][N]
Supports: Arin, Kenneth,[N]
Natasia, Emile, Carbon,[N]
Zeke, Avan, Yuyu, Estelle[X]

##GuideArinDesc
Arin Lirel[N]
Homeland: ???[N]
Age: 18[N]
Likes: Rationality, Blair[N]
Dislikes: Treachery, inaction[N]
Occupation: ???[N]
She/They[N][N]
A levelheaded young woman[N]
who often serves as the voice[N]
of reason among the group.[N]
She doesn't talk about herself[N]
much, but she's Blair's most[N]
reliable ally.[N][N]
Not much is known about[N]
Arin's past. Does she choose[N]
not to talk about it, or is[N]
there something deeper?[N][N]
Supports: Blair, Desmond,[N]
Sam, Sveltzalus, Yuyu[X]

##GuideKennethDesc
Kenneth von Neillstrom[N]
Homeland: Dalst[N]
Age: 17[N]
Likes: Knowledge, fires[N]
Dislikes: Ignorance, rats[N]
Occupation: Scholar[N]
He/Him[N][N]
A young man from Dalst,[N]
and the heir to Neillstrom.[N]
He's a relatively cold cynic,[N]
but he still cares deeply[N]
for those he trusts.[N][N]
The son of a military man,[N]
Kenneth was raised to[N]
appreciate good tactics and[N]
orderly soldiers. He didn't[N]
quite inherit his father's[N]
martial prowess, but he did[N]
happen to be quite the scholar,[N]
which was more than fine[N]
for his father. Eventually,[N]
he was sent to study at[N]
the Northern Arbordia Academy,[N]
where he befriended Blair[N]
despite their contrasting[N]
outlooks.[N][N]
Supports: Blair, Natasia,[N]
Stefan, Hilbert[X]

##GuideNatasiaDesc
Natasia Berks[N]
Homeland: Dalst[N]
Age: 18[N]
Likes: Blair, strength[N]
Dislikes: Weaklings, cowards[N]
Occupation: N/A[N]
She/Her[N][N]
A young woman from Dalst.[N]
She's not afraid to knock[N]
anyone down a peg or two,[N]
and would do nearly anything[N]
to keep her friends safe.[N][N]
Born to a small village in[N]
western Dalst, Natasia grew[N]
up appreciating the value[N]
of strength and determination.[N]
Through an outreach fund[N]
from the Northern Arbordia[N]
Academy, her village was[N]
granted the capacity to send[N]
several capable youths to[N]
study, with Natasia among them.[N]
(After all, the Academy doesn't[N]
just serve scholarly purposes;[N]
it's also a major source of[N]
manpower for the Dalstian Army.)[N]
There, she realized that the[N]
strict military life wasn't[N]
really her thing, but she also[N]
met and befriended Blair,[N]
Arin, and Kenneth, creating[N]
quite the unusual gang.[N][N]
Supports: Blair, Kenneth,[N]
Peggy, Bechamel[X]

##GuideStefanDesc
Stefan Ardricks[N]
Homeland: Aercolyn[N]
Age: 16[N]
Likes: Chivalry, Aercolyn[N]
Dislikes: Doubters, desolation[N]
Occupation: Squire[N]
He/They[N][N]
A young man from Aercolyn.[N]
He's an energetic squire,[N]
deeply engaged in his role as[N]
a protector of the people,[N]
despite his young age.[N][N]
Stefan was the first in his[N]
family lineage to yearn for[N]
knighthood; since his youth,[N]
he always had unmatchable[N]
energy and a penchant for[N]
helping those in need.[N]
Growing up, he was close[N]
friends with Johan, who sought[N]
to be a knight to follow in[N]
his family's footsteps, so it[N]
only made sense for the two[N]
to join together and take[N]
the chance to push each other[N]
further. While his natural[N]
talent isn't quite the same[N]
as Johan's, Stefan matches it[N]
with determination and[N]
enthusiasm.[N][N]
Supports: Kenneth, Desmond,[N]
Josef, Carbon, Johan[X]

##GuideDesmondDesc
Desmond Talis[N]
Homeland: Aercolyn[N]
Age: 26[N]
Likes: His men, horses[N]
Dislikes: Soreness, fruit[N]
Occupation: Army commander[N]
He/They[N][N]
The commander of Aercolyn's[N]
army. Despite the state's lack[N]
of power, he draws the full[N]
potential out of his men,[N]
and firmly believes that there[N]
are more important things to[N]
battle than mere numbers.[N][N]
Following Lord Aercolyn's exile,[N]
the Aercolyn army was left in[N]
an awkward indenpendent state.[N]
Desmond had joined several years[N]
into the confusion, and still[N]
found the ranks weak.[N]
Thus, he made it his mission to[N]
rise up and reform Aercolyn's[N]
army to be as cohesive as he[N]
felt his land deserved. The[N]
current state of the army is[N]
the fruit of his labor, and[N]
through his guiding hand,[N]
Aercolyn's strength is able[N]
to slowly match that of the[N]
rest of the continent.[N][N]
Supports: Arin, Stefan,[N]
Flynn, Mikey, Johan[X]

##GuideSamDesc
Samantha von Barford[N]
Homeland: Dalst[N]
Age: 19[N]
Likes: Companionship, jogging[N]
Dislikes: Isolation, the dark[N]
Occupation: Minor nobility[N]
She/They[N][N]
A young woman from a noble[N]
house of Dalst. She lacks[N]
self-confidence and has a[N]
near-crippling fear of[N]
being alone, but also[N]
hides great potential.[N][N]
Sam was born to Barford,[N]

From a young age, Josef's[N]
family was on the poorer side,[N]
and he lived under a zero-waste[N]
mindset. As he eventually joined[N]
the Dalstian army to support[N]
his family, this manifested[N]
itself as a tendency to hoard[N]
anything of value he could[N]
from the bodies of his enemies.[N]
Once his finances stabilized,[N]
and he had a chance to reflect[N]

changed- and decided that the[N]

would be to leave a generous[N]
