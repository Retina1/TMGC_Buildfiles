##C4_Blair_Natasia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
[OpenMidLeft]How have you been, Natasia?[A][N]
It feels it's been a while since we've[N]
had a good chance to talk.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I've never been better![N]
It's great to fight by your side.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This is really better than[N]
ordinary village life?[A][N]
You don't find it a little[N]
too dangerous?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Call me crazy, but I'd rather an interesting[N]
life of peril than a boring one.[A][N]
Plus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The idea of dying in battle[N]
alongside my friends[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] Might sound twisted,[N]
but I guess there's a beauty to it.[A][N]
Not that I have any plans of dying[N]
anytime soon, of course![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Huh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Personally, I'd rather a peaceful,[N]
life, even if it's not exciting.[A][N]
But I understand where you're coming from.[A][N]
If I have to fight for that life, I'm glad[N]
it's alongside you, at least.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]R-really? You flatter me, Blair![A][N]
I'm just glad that I can[N]
be of use to you.[A][X]

##C4_Arin_Desmond
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Greetings, Desmond.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, you're Arin, correct?[N]
The one I always see with Blair?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose you could put it that way.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Nothing's wrong with dedication and devotion.[N]
I mean, have you seen all that I do?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Can't say that I have.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Aercolyn's army may be small, but thanks[N]
in part to my leadership, it's quite fierce.[A][N]
I've learned that a mix of discipline and[N]
compassion is the key to a successful army.[A][N]
Strength can be honed, but without heart,[N]
an army is nothing.[A] No man is an island,[N]
and bonds of trust are essential.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]From my experience, I'd have to agree.[N]
Silly as it sounds.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Glad to hear we're of the same mind.[A][N]
Ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Perhaps this bond we're forming[N]
shall be the key to our victory.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe not when you say[N]
it out loud like that.[A] But I[N]
get what you mean.[A][X]

##C4_Solitude
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadSam][OpenMidLeft]
So, you're Sam[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I can't[N]
recall if we've met.[A][N]
You said you're a recent recruit, right?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Yes.[N]
I was a noble[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I mean, I guess I'm still a noble.[N]
Not a particularly important one, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I've never heard of a noblewoman[N]
joining the army[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] Might I ask[N]
what inspired you to join?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If you don't want to talk,[N]
I won't pry.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] always felt afraid.[N]
Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] isolation.[A] I thought that maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
the army would be what I needed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Camaraderie [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and the like[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That's what they stand for, right?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I'd never thought of it like that,[N]
but you're right.[A] Well, know that you'll[N]
always have us, Sam.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That means a lot.[N]
To be honest[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] I'm actually not that[N]
great with a bow yet.[A] I just told you[N]
all that so I'd be accepted.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Even took this with me, knowing[N]
I couldn't use it.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I'm sure you'll grow into[N]
a wondrous archer someday.[A][N]
I'd hold onto that.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe you're right.[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[A][X]

##C4_Honor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Lady Blair! I have something for you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What is this? Seems like[N]
a sheet of paper.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I believe it's a scroll that can confer[N]
hastened mastery of weaponry.[A][N]
I pried it out of some Yg'stran hands.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I will stop at nothing to serve Dalst-[N]
who does a little graverobbing hurt?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Don't look at me like that.[N]
Besides, I'm an honorable man.[A][N]
I left an equivalent amount of gold[N]
besides the man's body.[A][N]
Fair and complete compensation.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] see.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]We'll need any advantage we can take,[N]
and I assure you that they'd do the same.[A][N]
In fact, I doubt they'd even leave money[N]
behind for your departed family![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] take this.[N]
Thank you.[A][X]

##C4_Pursuit
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
Things don't look particularly[N]
great for us currently.[A][N]
I recommend we don't stick[N]
around here very long.[A][N]
We're going to want to get to[N]
the west as soon as possible-[A][N]
every one of us will need[N]
to escape.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, whatever happens, know that[N]
I refuse to leave anyone behind.[A][N]
I'll only escape once everyone else[N]
has escaped.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Normally I'd say that your life is[N]
more important here,[A] but I doubt[N]
you'd listen.[A] At least that's quite[N]
virtuous of you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I'll be careful.[N]
We'll all make it out of here alive.[A][X]
