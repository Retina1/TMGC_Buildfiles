##ViridianArcPrimer
Welcome to the Viridian Chapters![A][N]
Similar to the Zeke Chapters,[N]
you'll focus on a small party.[A][N]
A few notes for Viridian's maps:[A][N]
-Viridian has a convoy that can hold[N]
up to 50 items,[A] as well as a[N]
separate gold supply from Blair.[A][N]
-Just like Zeke's maps, any unit[N]
death will be a game over.[A][N]
-You will get access to base[N]
preparations starting next map.[A][N]
-Some maps may force deploy large[N]
amounts of units.[A] Remember that[N]
you can rearrange force-deploys.[A][N]
Thanks for sticking with this hack[N]
for so long, and good luck![A][X]
