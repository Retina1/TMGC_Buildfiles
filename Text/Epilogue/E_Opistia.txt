##Epilogue_ApolloFlynnOpistia
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
We[...] We're home.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
After all we've been through,[N]
this will be[...] blissful.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
[...]Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Will the two of you remain[N]
in Opistia, then?[A][N][OpenLeft]
For now, at least.[A][N]
I'd love to see more of[N]
Ulmaron, one day.[A][N]
But for now, the two of us[N]
shall make our life here.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I've[...] many ideas I wish[N]
to share with you.[A][N]
But they can wait.[A][N]
For now[...] Farewell,[N]
milady.[A] And thank you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you for joining us.[A][N]
You as well, Apollo.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I must thank you for saving me.[A][N]
Though if we continue like this,[N]
we'll be here all day.[A][N]
We're all why each other is here,[N]
and that's what matters.[A][N]
[...]Safe travels to you.[A][X]

##Epilogue_HilbertOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHilbert][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
At last, I'm truly a hero.[N]
Are you proud of me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, Hilbert.[N]
You're something special.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, miss![A][N]
Of course, a hero must always[N]
remain humble.[A] [...]Whoops.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Where'll you go now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Probably gonna stay around Opistia.[A][N]
There's always someone around here[N]
who'll need themselves a hero.[A][N]
Maybe once I'm older, I'll help[N]
people the world over.[A][N]
But for now, I think home'll do.[A][N]
If you ever need some of my heroism,[N]
you'll know where to find me![A][X]

##Epilogue_LarondeOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLaronde][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Back here, once again.[A][N]
I guess life must still go on.[N]
[...]Hard as it may become.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm still[...] so sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] I will do what I can to[N]
ensure this happens to nobody else.[A][N]
[...]Do take care, Blair.[A][OpenEyes] And apologies[N]
for dampening a triumphant mood.[A][N]
[...]Even in this heartache, there is[N]
something to be proud of.[A][X]

##Epilogue_RoseOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRose][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
Back home for me, I guess.[N]
[...]It's been a long time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
And I'm sure your family[N]
will be delighted.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]True.[A] It's just[...] odd.[N]
Being back now.[A][N]
After the horrors I've seen.[A][N]
[...]All at the ripe young age[N]
of fifteen.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'll live.[N]
Probably.[A][N]
[...]See ya, Blair.[A][X]

##Epilogue_LarondeRoseOpistia
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLaronde][OpenLeft][LoadRose][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenFarLeft]
I[...] must once again thank[N]
you, Blair.[A] For letting the[N]
both of us return home.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Life'll be boring now.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'd hardly say that, Rose.[A][N]
There's a lot to appreciate here.[N]
And nothing to harm you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]I guess.[A][ToggleSmile] You'll find some[N]
way to amuse me, Moronde.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That's my job.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Take care, you two.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Of course. You're always welcome[N]
in Opistia. Come see us sometime.[A][X]

##Epilogue_JosefAthenaOpistia
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJosef][OpenLeft][LoadAthena][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
Are you staying here, Josef?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
That I am, milady.[A][N]
I've found a kindred spirit,[N]
and I trust in Dalst.[A][N]
Thus, I've decided to take[N]
my happiness into account.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Under our watchful eyes, Opistia[N]
shall never have to fear.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps you'll wish to learn[N]
to ride a wyvern, Josef.[A][N]
Can't imagine that armor's[N]
pleasant to walk in.[A][N]
Especially in this heat.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It[...] builds character.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I wouldn't mind a good[N]
wyvern ride with you.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]We can make that happen.[A][X]

##Epilogue_AthenaOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAthena][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
[...]If I'm no longer needed,[N]
then this is where we part.[A][N]
Take care with the peace we've[N]
all fought for.[A] It will be[N]
a fragile and precious thing.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll do our best to protect it.[N]
[...]What will you do now?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What I've always done.[A][N]
Serve as a defensive pillar[N]
for Opistia.[A] Our lands are[N]
peaceful,[A] but we still must[N]
remain ever vigilant.[A][N]
Especially in the wake of all[N]
that has rattled Ulmaron.[A][N]
[...]Keep yourself well, milady.[A][X]

##Epilogue_FlynnOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFlynn][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] shall take my leave.[N]
If that's alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Thanks for[N]
helping us, Flynn.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of[...] Of course.[A][N]
It was[...] good practice.[A][N]
[...]I'm not particularly[N]
great at goodbyes.[A][N]
[...]Goodbye, I suppose.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ApolloVladmirOpistia
[OpenFarLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenLeft]
I must once again thank you[N]
for everything, Archbishop.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It was truly nothing, child.[A][N]
I'm simply glad to be of[N]
service to the faithful.[A][N]
[...]That said, I've been considering[N]
an eventual retirement,[A] as you[N]
might have overheard.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I[...] could never replace you.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Nor was I expecting you to.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
But I know I can step down content when[N]
there's youths like you in place.[A][N]
Youths who see the world for its[N]
goodness,[A] and who wish to spread[N]
its goodness further.[A][N][OpenLeft]
[...]Thank you, Archbishop.[A][N]
And thank you, milady.[N]
For all you've done.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Without Opistia, I'd be nowhere.[N]
[...]I thank you in return.[A][X]

##Epilogue_ApolloOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadApollo][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
This has been a truly[N]
unforgettable journey.[A][N]
[...]But I'm ready to return[N]
to a comfortable normal.[A][N]
I'll see if the church needs[N]
me back here,[A] and perhaps[N]
return to my travels soon.[A][N]
[...]I must once again thank you[N]
for saving me way back when.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's what any good person[N]
would've done, Apollo.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I would hope. But it is still[N]
inspiring to spread good.[A][N]
[...]Take care, please.[A][X]

##Epilogue_VladmirOpistia
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVladmir][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair][OpenMidLeft]
At last, He has delivered unto[N]
us a new era of peace.[A][N]
A peace which I, and all Opistia,[N]
are eager to bask in.[A][N]
[...]All that said, young lady,[N]
I've grown old and weary.[A][N]
I believe soon it may be time[N]
for me to step down,[A] and let[N]
the youths lead the world.[A][N]
Opistia's no shortage of truly[N]
exemplary successors.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps then I can live out[N]
my life's longest-held dream.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What would that be?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To further study and raise wyverns.[A][N]
My dearest friend Wendell could use[N]
some companions of his own.[A][N]
[...]There's a truly ecstatic beauty[N]
to this species.[A] To all the lives[N]
that make up this world.[A][N]
Perhaps that is what inspired me to[N]
seek and spread His meaning.[A][N]
[...]But I digress. Enjoy your time[N]
in Opistia,[A] and thank you for[N]
all you've done for Ulmaron.[A][X]
