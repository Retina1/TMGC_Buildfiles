##GuideMovementSkillsDesc
All infantry classes have[N]
Shove. Heroes, Swordmasters,[N]
and Assassins have Swap.[N]
Snipers, Assassins,[N]
and Generals have Pivot.[N]
Halberdiers have[N]
Reposition. Warriors,[N]
Berserkers, and[N]
Generals have Smite.[N]
Certain units may also get[N]
these, plus the skill Swarp,[N]
as personal skills.[N]
Hopefully, this will help[N]
non-staff infantry contribute[N]
when the game inevitably[N]
devolves into skips.[X]

##GuideChanges
Basic Changes[X]

##GuideChangesDesc
Weapon triangle is now[N]
+/-2 Mt and +/-10 Hit.[N]
Additionally, S Ranks now[N]
give +3 might and +10 hit.[N][N]
Supports have been completely[N]
reworked, though bonuses[N]
are still based on proximity.[N][N]
Many weapons have significantly[N]
higher stats than vanilla.[N][N]
Enemies get +5 hit on Hard,[N]
and +10 hit on Lunatic.[N]
Additionally, enemies (including[N]
recruitables) get HMB.[N][N]
A unit's items are sent to the[N]
convoy upon their death.[N]
Note that this only applies[N]
to blue units.[N][N]
Magic weapons do not grant[N]
WEXP, but combat staves do.[N][N]
Check the statscreen for info[N]
on learned skills. (Promo)[N]
means a skill is learnt upon[N]
promotion. A number represents[N]
what level is needed to learn[N]
that skill. A + means the unit[N]
must be that level in a[N]
promoted class. If a skill is[N]
skipped (ex. promoting before[N]
learning a (15) skill), it's[N]
gone forever![X]

##GuideBase
Base and Supports[X]

##GuideBaseDesc
During battle preparations,[N]
Base Conversations can be[N]
read. They provide a wealth[N]
of benefits, and a wealth of[N]
lore. Convos marked with !!![N]
grant concrete benefits,[N]
such as items and units.[N]
Convos marked with !![N]
contain valuable gameplay hints,[N]
such as mechanic overviews[N]
and map gimmicks.[N]
Convos marked with ![N]
are unimportant beyond[N]
providing some flavor[N]
and worldbuilding.[N]
Convos with no ! displayed[N]
will instead be formatted as[N]
[OpenQuote]___ and ___[CloseQuote].[N]
These are supports.[N]
Activating a support will[N]
increase that pair's support[N]
rank. Prior supports must have[N]
been activated earlier in[N]
the game (ex. you must have[N]
gotten Blair/Arin C to be able[N]
to activate Blair/Arin C+).[N]
There are 5 support ranks-[N]
C, C+, B, B+, and A.[N]
A unit can have 5 supports,[N]
with no limit on ranks.[N]
Support bonuses are determined[N]
on a pair-by-pair and[N]
rank-by-rank basis- affinity[N]
doesn't exist anymore.[N]
Sometimes, it may also be[N]
possible to improve support[N]
rank via talk conversations.[X]

##GuideSpecial
Special Mechanics[X]

##GuideSpecialDesc
Fog of War: Torch items no[N]
longer exist, and thieves[N]
do not have bonus vision.[N]
Rather, all extra vision is[N]
granted through map torches,[N]
which function similar to[N]
their Tellius incarnation.[N]
Move next to a torch and[N]
use the appropriate menu[N]
command to light it.[N]
Be warned that certain[N]
events can be triggered[N]
by torchlight.[N][N]
Escape Maps: In escape maps,[N]
Blair must be the last unit[N]
to escape. If you can't escape[N]
for whatever reason, make sure[N]
she's not carrying anybody.[N][N]
Weapon Type Icons: Effective[N]
weapon descriptions have[N]
icons indicating what[N]
movement/weapon type they[N]
are effective against.[N]
Generally, effectives[N]
good against specific weapons[N]
are only effective based[N]
on a class's main weapon-[N]
ex. a Sword General only[N]
takes effective damage from[N]
anti-sword weapons despite[N]
also having axes and bows.[N][N]
Green Units: Unless otherwise[N]
stated, there are no rewards[N]
or penalties for the survival[N]
of unrecruitable green units.[N][N]
Item Indicators: A flashing green[N]
bag icon on an enemy indicates[N]
that it drops an item on death.[N]
A flashing red diamond icon[N]
indicates a stealable item,[N]
such as a gemstone or[N]
stat boosting item.[N][N]
If there are any other[N]
mechanics I have forgotten[N]
to elaborate on, send in[N]
feedback and let me know![X]

##GuideAercolyn
Aercolyn[X]

##GuideAercolynDesc
A territory at the north[N]
tip of the Dalstian Alliance.[N]
Some time ago, the previous lord[N]
of Aercolyn, Blair's father,[N]
committed acts ruled to be[N]
high treason by Dalst,[N]
and was subsequently exiled[N]
while the territory's influence[N]
over Dalstian politics was[N]
rapidly diminished.[N][N]
Currently, the state operates[N]
independently under the rule[N]
of Blair and her advisors,[N]
with a distinct military from[N]
the Allied Dalstian Army.[X]

##GuideDalst
Dalst[X]

##GuideDalstDesc
An alliance of noble territories,[N]
whose most noteworthy export[N]
is knowledge and magical talent.[N]
Notable houses include Neillstrom,[N]
who provides the single largest[N]
contribution to the nation's army,[N]
Ciraweiss, who's known for their[N]
agricultural contributions[N]
(most notably a tender wood[N]
used in most staves), and[N]
Arbordia, a central territory[N]
used as the nation's capital.[X]

##GuideMevion
Mevion[X]

##GuideMevionDesc
A swampy land once ruled[N]
by a monarchy, currently[N]
ruled by a democracy.[N]
Following the crowning of[N]
the final king, and his[N]
numerous unpopular decisions[N]
(including an exorbitant[N]
taxation increase), a[N]
revolution swept the land.[N]
What resulted from a bloody[N]
civil war was Ulmaron's first[N]
land run by election.[N]
Since then, the state has[N]
remained relatively isolated[N]
from the affairs of other[N]
nations, with a relatively[N]
hostile stance towards those[N]
who seek to potentially[N]
drag Mevion into conflict.[X]

##GuideElbaCor
Elba Cor[X]

##GuideElbaCorDesc
A mountainous kingdom ruled[N]
by a long-lasting monarchy.[N]
Elba Cor and the old Mevionese[N]
kingdom were founded a mere[N]
6 years apart, and Elba Cor's[N]
founding year is often used[N]
as a baseline for the entire[N]
continent. Around the same[N]
time as the Mevionese Revolution,[N]
Elba Cor's prince Zeke was[N]
presumably assassinated,[N]
and the populace was quick[N]
to blame Mevion. As a result[N]
of this, as well as Aercolyn's[N]
fall from grace, Elba Cor's[N]
longtime alliances with Mevion[N]
and Dalst have largely faded.[X]

##GuideOpistia
Opistia[X]

##GuideOpistiaDesc
A desert land ruled by[N]
the Opistian Church.[N]
Its capital, Opistinia, was[N]
built around an ancient oasis,[N]
which, much like many other[N]
Opistinian landmarks, is seen[N]
as a great blessing.[N]
One of Opistia's oldest landmarks[N]
is the manmade Tower of Opistia,[N]
built to honor Opistus.[N]
In relatively recent years,[N]
the tower was expanded into[N]
something of a space elevator[N]
through a collaborative effort[N]
with Dalst, and since then,[N]
the two nations have become[N]
unlikely allies.[X]

An armored knight of Dalst,[N]
known for his devotion and[N]
his strong sense of honor-[N]
even if [OpenQuote]honor[CloseQuote] isn't a[N]
term most associate with[N]
his grave-robbery.[N][N]
From a young age, Josef's[N]
family was on the poorer side,[N]
and he lived under a zero-waste[N]
mindset. As he eventually joined[N]
the Dalstian army to support[N]
his family, this manifested[N]
itself as a tendency to hoard[N]
anything of value he could[N]
from the bodies of his enemies.[N]
Once his finances stabilized,[N]
and he had a chance to reflect[N]
on his harrowing actions, Josef[N]
changed- and decided that the[N]
only fair way to grave-rob[N]
would be to leave a generous[N]
equivalent of gold behind.[N][N]

When revolution first broke out,[N]
Butch was among the first to[N]

Once the revolution came[N]
