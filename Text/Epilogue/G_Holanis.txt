Whew[...] Think I'm gonna stay[N]
back in this inn a while.[A][N]
Not to say I didn't enjoy my[N]
time with you.[A] Quite the[N]
contrary, in fact.[A][N]
But I've gotta take things[N]
slow again.[A] War's more[N]
breakneck than I remember.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]So it is.[A][N]
Well, stay safe. And I hope[N]
you see your brothers again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, lass. Probably gonna head[N]
home once I'm done 'ere.[A][N]
Ulmaron'll make for one heck[N]
of a story to tell.[A][N]
But for now, I shall take my[N]
pleasure in leisure.[A][X]

[...]You're back in Holanis?[A][N]
I don't think I'll ever quite[N]
get you, Sveltzalus.[A][N]
Still, you've been just as[N]
worthy a companion as the rest.[A][N]
I truly do thank you.[A][N]
[...]Wherever you find yourself,[N]
I wish you well.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleInvert]

[...]And so I return.[A][N]
There is[...] much to be[N]
done here.[A] Much for this[N]
city to atone for.[A][N]
But[...] We shall do all in[N]
our power to atone.[A][N]
I will ensure that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
With Dalst's influence out of[N]
the picture,[A] maybe Holanis[N]
can finally truly prosper.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I hope so.[A] And if not, we shall[N]
at least fail on our own demerits.[A][N]
Just as we shall rise on our merits.[N]
[...]Be well, young lady.[A][X]
