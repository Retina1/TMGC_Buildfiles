We've come far, kid.[N]
You prepared for this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Even if I weren't, there's nothing[N]
that can stop this from happening.[A][N]
All I can do now is fight for my[N]
friends that've brought me here.[A][N]
That's all any of us can do.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Sometimes I think about how[N]
I could've been one of them.[A][N]
Someone on the other side, fighting[N]
against nobles youths like you.[A][N]
We'd believe our cause to be as just[N]
you believe yours to be, of course.[A][N]
And who could tell us that we're[N]
truly wrong?[A] When we don't know[N]
the full truth of everything?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]I[...] I wish we could make[N]
them all understand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
The world's a cruel thing.[A][N]
All we can do is end this[N]
as soon as possible.[A][N]
And then prevent this from[N]
ever again coming to pass.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Then let's get going.[A][N]
If there's anyone that can[N]
bring this to an end, it's us.[A][N]
My swiftness and your endurance[N]

I wanted to thank you, Desmond.[A][N]
I've never been much for war, but[N]
your techniques have kept me alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm honored to hear. That's my[N]
ultimate goal, really.[A][N]
Keeping all of my charge alive.[A][N]
As long as there's life, there's[N]
hope for tomorrow.[A][N]
Even the weariest of men can do[N]
great things,[A] as long as they[N]
get the chance to live another day.[A][N]
[...]Perhaps it's selfish of me, but[N]
I can hardly bear when my men fall.[A][N]
When they die under my watch[...][N]
It's like I'm betraying them.[A][N][CloseEyes]
I know it's not the case.[A][N]
I should know that more than[N]
anyone else here.[A][N]
And it's not like I'm the one[N]
who pays the price.[A][N]
[...]But all I wish is to see my[N]
men make it home alive.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd much rather fight for someone[N]
who strains themselves like you.[A][N]
Who mourns every death instead of[N]
seeing lives as numbers.[A][N]
Maybe that's something Yg'stra can[N]
stand to learn from all of this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
We can hope. Life is something[N]
I believe is truly precious.[A][N]
Now, then. Be safe out there, Mikey.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good luck to you as well, Desmond.[A][X]

I'd be foolish to think you're[N]

Still. Doing this would mean the[N]

All hypothetical, old man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Who am I to presume?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Worry not, child. My actions[N]

I have granted all manners of[N]
control necessary to the church.[A][N]
If I were to fall in battle, our[N]

Isn't Opistia an ally of Dalst?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very true. Aercolyn and Dalst both[N]
are our allied nations on paper.[A][N]
And perhaps it is irresponsible for[N]
me to turn against one of them.[A][N]
But I believe our path to be just.[N]
To be one that He is proud of.[A][N]
And we fight not out of hatred,[N]
but of wishing to right wrongs.[A][N]
Unfortunate as it may be, if it[N]
brings peace to the continent,[A][N]
I am willing to make Dalst[N]
stand down and repent.[A][N]
If worst comes to worst, I shall ask[N]
nothing but peace for Opistia.[A][N]

Feeling like you've thrown[N]
away good lives.[A][N][OpenEyes]
But it'd be betraying what they[N]
stood for if we wallow in despair.[A][N]
If their deaths don't hold meaning[...][N]
it's our duty to give them meaning.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]I guess so. Still[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It'll[...] never be easy. It's hard[N]
for me to believe too.[A][N]
But[...] I've learned that we can't[N]
get caught up on the dead.[A][N]
After all[...] The rest of us[N]
are still alive.[A][N]
We've still got many who rely[N]
on the two of us.[A][N]
[...]Maybe this isn't really[N]
helping.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see where you're coming[N]
from.[A] I think we all just[...][N]
need time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Of course.[A][X]

Even more fighting[...] It's[N]
so tiring, Carbon.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah.[A][N]
Once we're back home, I'm retiring[N]
at the ripe old age of seventeen.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Actually, on that note[...][N]
What WERE you gonna do?[A][N]
In general, I mean.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Never got a chance to really[N]
think about that.[A][N]
Knowing our country, I'd be doing[N]
military stuff for the rest of time.[A][N]
Doesn't appeal much to me, now.[A][N]
So I'm kinda glad this whole mess[N]
happened. Gives us another chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a way to look at it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Every last one of us has had[N]
our fill of fighting, I'm sure.[A][N]
I wanna enjoy life a bit.[N]
Do some wacky Carbon-y things.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Guess we gotta work for our happiness.[N]
It's worth it, though.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. You're right, pal.[A][X]

[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Did you know of this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I did not. And still[...][N]
To think of this happening[...][A][N]
All in my homeland.[N]
It's shameful.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You can still right it.[N]
This is your home, right?[A][N]
A true knight fights for[N]
their homeland.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]But what if the powers that[N]
be chose this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You'd still fight for your home.[N]
Just[...] for a better future for it.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
[...]Quite insightful, for[N]
somebody so young.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
If I saw Elba Cor turn astray,[N]
I'd do all I could to save it.[A][N]
Sir Hyperius[...] He showed me that[N]
there's a difference.[A][N]
Between what a country wants[N]
and what a country needs.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
Well, then. Can't go letting[N]
you down.[A] I'll make a just[N]
future for Holanis.[A][N]
Even if it hurts in the now.[A][X]

Heya, Leila.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Do you have more idiotic[N]
schemes like last time?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nah. Not enough space in here[N]
to make my pegasus idea work.[A][N]
Besides, you didn't seem to[N]
like it.[A] Not gonna bring up[N]
somethin' you don't like again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Huh.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hey. I can be serious.[N]
[...]Not good at it.[A][N]
But I sure can be.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Good for you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No need for ya' to be cold.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Wouldn't hurt to smile.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
[...]That's all you get.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
[...]That'll do.[A][X]

##CassiusMikeyBSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMikey][OpenMidRight][LoadCassius]
Say, Mikey. What's the most[N]
delicious thing you can make?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]That's a tough one.[N]
Taste's subjective.[A][N]
I know you're quite the[N]
fan of meats[...][A][N]
Especially the smoked variety.[A][N]
So to you, that's probably[N]
the best meal I can produce.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair. What's YOUR favorite, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] I'd have to go with[N]
this particular stew.[A][N]
My father used to make it[...][N]
It's nothing too special.[A][N]
But at the same time, it's[N]
everything it needs to be.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[...]Could never make it[N]
quite how he could.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Sounds tasty. I'm sure you[N]
could do it justice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Perhaps. It's been some time[N]
since I've last made it.[A][N]
But it'd do me good.[A][N]
And I know you. You'll eat[N]
anything I make anyway.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You're probably right there.[A][N]
I'd trust you to make a[N]
plate of rocks taste good.[A][X]

[...]Well, now's as good a[N]
time as any.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You got me swingin' axes.[N]
Only fair I pay you back.[A][N]
[...]This is a healing staff.[N]
It heals people.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see. I know you said[N]
you're not good at this.[A][N]
Teaching things, I mean.[A][N]
And healing seems really[N]
complicated.[A][N]
I can always just ask[N]
Blair to show me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Trust me. This means a lot[N]
to little ol' me.[A][N]
[...]You've served as good stress[N]
relief, and as a good friend.[A][N]
The least I can do is stretch[N]
myself a bit to help you out.[A][N]
Besides, this'll help you keep[N]
anyone else you care about safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Well[...] I can't go denying[N]
you now, can I?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]As I was saying, this is a[N]
staff.[A] It's sorta like an axe.[N]
Long wooden shaft. Object on top.[A][N]
They're fickle little bastards, though.[N]
Gotta grip them like so.[A][N]
Else, their magic just won't work.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I see, I see.[A][N]
I've seen you use that[N]
a lot. Let me try.[A][N][MoveRight]
[...]So, do I just grab it like[N]
this and wave it around?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]It's a bit more complex.[N]
[...]But that'll do for now.[A][N]
You're a quick learner.[N]
You'll figure it out.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me,[A][N]
I think that guy over there's[N]
just asking to be bonked.[A][X]
