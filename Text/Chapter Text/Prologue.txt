##Prologue_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair]
...Whew... It's been some time.[N]
I forgot how far Arbordia truly was.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
I mean... Are you really surprised?[A][N]
You live at the extreme tip of Dalst.[N]
The capital would naturally be more central.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I suppose. Still. I could swear[N]
it was a far shorter trip.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, back then, you WERE a child.[N]
Didn't ever really take this by foot.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I get it.[N]
You can stop now.[A][N]
...What's that over there?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
If I had to wager a guess,[N]
either bandits or rebels.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Rebels? Here?[N]
Why?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...I swear, you're clueless.[A][N]
To put it simply, the populace is[N]
uneasy about recent negotiations-[A][N]
between Dalst and Yg'stra.[A][N]
There's a popular belief that the[N]
Yg'strans have been gearing for war,[A][N]
and that Dalst's attempts at an alliance[N]
will just lead Dalst into conflict.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see.[A][N]
In any case, we should probably quell this.[A][N]
I fear these rebels may harm the[N]
civilian populace,[A] and I'm sure[N]
the higher-ups will understand.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
That's a bold move, but if[N]
you're confident,[A] I'm with[N]
you all the way.[A][N]
Just be careful.[A][N]
It'd be quite the shame for[N]
us to perish so quickly.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
But of course![A][N]
Together, I have no doubts[N]
that we'll prevail![A][X]

##PKennethText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth]
...What do we have here?[N]
Wait... is that Blair?[A][N]
What's she doing here?[A][N]
...And who's that guy seconds[N]
away from axing her?[A][N]
Wait... That's unimportant[N]
I should help her- if not for her,[A][N]
then for my honor as Kenneth,[N]
son of General Neillstrom of-[A][N]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Yes, lovely to see you, Kenneth.[A][N]
Now stop monologuing and[N]
start fighting.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...My bad.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent]
...Whoever lives here must[N]
have already evacutated.[A]
...What's this note?[A][N]
[OpenQuote]If any heroes see this, please,[N]
take this relic and save our town![CloseQuote][A][N]
...It'd be wrong NOT to[N]
take this, right?[A][X]

##PSVillageText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan1]
Are you with Dalst? ...Yes?[N]
Oh, thank the heavens![A][N]
These rebels have been performing[N]
vile acts to draw your attention.[A][N]
At this point, I don't even care[N]
what their cause is anymore-[A][N]
I just want to know that I'll[N]
live to see tomorrow.[A][N]
Please, take this, and use it[N]
to save our village![A][X]

##PDavelarnBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavelarn]
Hey! We're Dalstian too![N]
Why are you fighting us?[A][N]
What's so wrong with protest?[N]
So what if civilians die?[A][N]
Better them over us,[N]
I say![A][X]

##PDavelarnDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDavelarn]
Urgh! You... scum...[A][N]
Signing us... away...[N]
to... Yg'stra...[A][N]
Well... This isn't...[N]
the end... for you...[A][N]
Killing us... won't make...[N]
this... go...[A][X]
