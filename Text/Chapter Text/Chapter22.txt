##C22_Ending
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So it's confirmed.[N]
Dalst was behind this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That makes our choice easy.[N]
They're our enemy now.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]We should continue. I think[N]
I see something in the distance.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. If the map's accurate,[N]
we're near Gohranos.[A][N]
Something of a new capital.[N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] haven't been there.[A][N]
But I've heard much of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] be smart to rest and[N]
resupply.[A] We need to prepare[N]
for any possibility.[A][X]


##C22_Opening
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's still remarkable. This place[N]
is beautiful.[A] And yet, so few[N]
people have resettled.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's what superstitions and[N]
a lacking government will do.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It's still a home to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you sure you wish to rule?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Of[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] course.[A][N][OpenEyes]
Elba Cor[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] is my birthright.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps so. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You seem[N]
to resent that fact.[A][N]
Would ascending the throne[N]
truly make you happy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What does that matter?[N]
My land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] needs a king.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Does it? We've seen how[N]
many lands have changed.[A][N]
Mevion, Holanis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
What says Elba Cor can't[N]
change, too?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's just a thought.[A][N][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, do you wish to rule?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You got me there, I guess.[N]
I came this far for my title[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But with what we're about to do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
does that even mean anything?[A][N]
Or will it all have been for[N]
nothing?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The journey you had to[N]
prove yourself worthy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That's hardly nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I suppose so.[A][X]

##C22_Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadZeke]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]More enemies?[N]
How in the hell?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Mevion's colors.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] are they doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]This might've all been a trap.[N]
Mevion's full of mercenaries, right?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Maybe this force was hired to[N]
intercept us at Jraeyan.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So Dalst knows what we're doing?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Maybe. Or maybe they were a contingency[N]
for the Viridian Mercenaries.[A][N]
Either way[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We have to[N]
take them out.[A][N]
We need to make it back to Dalst.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Everyone. It seems[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] the world's our[N]
enemy now. Be ready for anything.[A][X]

Yeah. I'm with them. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I don't[N]
look forward to this duel.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Can't say I do, either.[N]
You're a force of nature.[A][N]
I know we've not seen each other[N]
much since the revolution,[A][N]
but I've heard stories.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Couldn't you just join us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I guess I could.[A][N]
This'll cost ya, though.[A][N]
How's a lifetime of free meals[N]
from Rutherford's place sound?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I could talk my brother into that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]

Pop quiz, lass. Do I know you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

I feel I've seen you around[N]
long ago. In the capital.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now that I think of it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You're familiar.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Well, then. This is awkward.[N]
Someone's payrollin' your death.[A][N]
Sorry to tell ya like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I figured as much.[N]
Why tell me this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's drainin', killing friendly faces.[N]
But it's also draining not havin' money.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'll cut you a deal.[A][N]
I'll join ya, and then once you're[N]
done fightin',[A] you'll give me[N]
a small fortune.[A][N]
Don't say you can't afford to.[N]
I know you're a noble.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well. We could use[N]
someone with your skill.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Excellent. And, also[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Never let[N]
it be heard what I did.[A][N]
Don't need this mercy taintin'[N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd say that was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a success.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Here's hoping he's still[N]
the mind to know where he stands.[A][N]
That he's not to meddle with our[N]

The terms of his exile were[N]
quite clear. Quite blunt.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You seem hesitant. Don't be.[N]
You're doing the right thing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]It just saddens me, somewhat.[N]
To see a great man fall.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'd better return to Arbordia.[A][N]
I believe I've got some manner[N]
of protege inbound.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, right. One of those academy[N]
up-and-comings.[A] I believe yours[N]
was chosen by that outreach lottery.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Correct. I've read all about him.[N]
I've seen his work. It's promising.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]If nothing else, it's proof that[N]
the outreach funds are worth it.[A][N]
All Dalst deserves the chance to[N]
reach their potential.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
It's a chance he'd never otherwise have.[N]
