Any new research updates?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
In a sense, I guess.[A][N]
I've been listening to some of[N]
those recordings we found.[A][N]
Trying to make sense of what[N]
those voices were talking about.[A][N]
The[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The Dalstians were[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
very careful.[A][N]
Their procedures were only[N]
alluded to in codewords.[A][N]
Their notes are[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] nigh[N]
incomprehensible.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] unfortunate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] let this happen.[N]
Right under my nose.[A][N]
How'd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I never think[N]
anything of this all?[A][N]
Those excursions to Holanis?[A][N]
I was always told that one[N]
day my work would call me there.[A][N]
Would[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I have become what[N]
I saw?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] don't think you would've.[A][N]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] too kind a man.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what I thought of Elcorian.[N]
Of Lord Arbordia.[A][N][OpenEyes]
What I still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wish to think.[A][N]
And yet, they took part in it.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] have to find out why.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] still believe in you.[N]

Must say, Cassius. You're quite[N]
the excellent warrior.[A][N]
Despite your oddities.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As are you. Despite your lack[N]
of oddities.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What can I say?[A][N]
My life's a simple one. But it's[N]
comfortable and satisfying.[A][N]
I won't say I'm not amused by[N]
your larger-than-life antics.[A][N]
But I'm also more than happy[N]
with regular sized life.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's fair. Guess since Opistia's[N]
the most stable country around,[A][N]
her citizens'll be the same way.[A][N]
Stable. Content.[A][N]
The rest of us are on a precipice[N]
of change and unrest.[A][N]
But, hey. That doesn't bother[N]
me in the slightest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Neither mindset's necessarily wrong.[N]
It's all just perspective.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yup! [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Now that's the REAL[N]

Say, Archbishop. I've never[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
been the most devout.[A][N]
But I'm curious of the mechanics[N]
behind Opistian light magics.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
To be frank, it's somewhat[N]
of a mystery even to us.[A][N]
We all know that our faith[N]
in Him empowers our magic.[A][N]
But I've heard of faith in[N]
other causes empowering magic, too.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Really?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've not studied it a huge amount[N]
myself, but from what I've read,[A][N]
anything that garners enough faith[N]
could theoretically garner magic.[A][N]
In a sense, humanity could create[N]
any manner of god it wishes,[A][N]
purely through believing in it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that not heretical?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Judge not. That is His word.[N]
And that, we shall do.[A][N]
Those who find power in faith[N]
deserve to bear it.[A][N]
No matter what the faith is in.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's quite open-minded.[A][N]
Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] To think faith alone[N]
is enough to bend the world.[A][N]
I've always been grounded in[N]
the tangibility of anima.[A][N]
Thank you for enlightening me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, young one.[N]
I am glad to speak with you.[A][X]

Hey, lady. I know last we[N]
spoke, we spoke of pride.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How I had none for Mevion.[N]
Well, I was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] wrong.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
How so?[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]My old man's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] been fightin'[N]
for some kind of change.[A][N]
Mevion's a closed off place.[N]
A hostile land to outsiders.[A][N]
Especially Elba Cor. Obviously.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Though, I suppose now,[N]
there's not much reason for that.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
In any case, the old man's gotten[N]
himself an elected position.[A][N]
And he wants to go and change[N]
that.[A] You wanna know a sayin'[N]
we have in Mevion?[A][N]
Every man can be a king.[A][N]
But then we go and shunt off[N]
people who come to live that.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]My old man truly believes in[N]
those first two words.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a right disgrace to[N]
all that.[A][N]
Hated the idea because it was[N]
something different.[A][N]
But fightin' with this group's[N]
made me realize[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] It ain't a[N]
bad ideal.[A][N]
And now, well. I guess it's[N]
something to be proud of.[A][N]
Even if I'm the furthest thing[N]
from worthy of it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see. [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why tell me[N]
of all people this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're one of those honor-bound[N]
types.[A] You're not gonna go spilling[N]
the beans about this.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] still have an image to[N]
uphold.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]And so does he.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I understand. Your secret's[N]
safe with me, Jeff.[A][N]

you can change.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]

I must say, Flynn. I'll almost[N]
miss Holanis.[A][N]
It's a truly fascinating place.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
That it is. I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] might actually[N]
return once this is all over.[A][N]
The histories of this land[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

ever has.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can't quite say that I'm[N]

in most writings.[A] To get to see[N]
it firsthand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Make discoveries that nobody else[N]
ever has before[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Understand what this place truly[N]
was like many years ago[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've always loved to learn[N]
history[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] And now, I get[N]
the chance to uncover it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps I'll return too.[A][N]
You make it sound so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] exciting.[A][N]
That is, if you'd wish to[N]
have me around.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Certainly. We're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] of a similar mind.[A][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I've reconsidered things.[A][N]
Bows seem pretty alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh? That's quite the change[N]
of heart. What prompted it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've thought about protecting[N]
myself as myself.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Magic's boring. Too much[N]
reading and thinking.[A][N]
And weapons leave me a bit[N]
too close to the bad guys.[A][N]
That leaves bows. They're[N]
easy AND safe![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Trust me. I've spent many[N]
years mastering the bow.[A][N]
It's far from easy.[A][N]
My clothes might not show it,[N]
but these arms have muscle to them.[A][N]
All from archery.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Simply a difference[N]
in skill.[A][N]
I'll just copy someone[N]

It's truly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] something.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

All I've ever wanted is to learn.[N]

that. Peering into the unknowable.[A][N]
Learning from what you think can't[N]
teach a thing.[A] It's reason, bent.[A][N]
