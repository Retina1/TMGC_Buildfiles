I know it's probably not the[N]
best time to talk,[A][N]
but I just wanted to say[...][A][N]
That flower still suits you[N]
really well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Thanks. It's been a rough[N]
campaign, for sure.[A][N]
But appreciating small things[N]
like that is worth our time.[A][N]
So don't feel bad about bringing[N]
it up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You know what? You're right.[A][N]
There's a lovely ordinary life[N]
waiting for us after this war.[A][N]
And it's alright to step back and[N]
think about it sometimes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Exactly! It's something to[N]
fight for.[A] I'll return to[N]
Aercolyn, and you'll[...][A][N]
Well, what'll you do?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's a tough one. The world's[N]
a big place.[A] I want to see[N]
all of it.[A] So, I guess I'd[N]
keep seeing where my travels go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Feels like half the army[N]
thinks that way.[A][N]
I can't blame them. I wouldn't[N]
mind it myself[...][A][N]
But that's probably not gonna[N]
be in the cards for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You've been far from home[N]
for months now.[A][N]
I'm sure you could make that[N]
many months more if you wish.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I guess so. We'll see.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, if you make that choice,[N]
I'd be glad to accompany you.[A][X]

##C23_Arin_Sam_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadArin]
[...]I'm still struggling to wrap[N]
my head around[...] everything.[A][N]
But we ought[...] to focus on[N]
what's in front of us.[A][N]
You were officially in the Dalst[N]
army, right?[A] Is there anything[N]
you remember about Tarquin?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]General Neillstrom was[...][N]
a kind man.[A][N]
During training, he'd make sure[N]
to introduce himself to everyone.[A][N]
He said I had[...] potential.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]He wasn't wrong.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh[...] You meant his fighting[N]
style.[A] Sadly, I never saw[N]
him in actual combat.[A][N]
[...]I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's[...] alright.[A][N]
[...]He's a man of bountiful tactical[N]
and martial skill.[A][N]
I'm just[...] worried.[A][N]
Thought any knowledge would help.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure[...] we'll be alright.[A][N]
I know we've nothing to base[N]
that on.[A] But[...] it's the same kind[N]
of hope you've given me before.[A][N]
Assurance that all will[...][N]
be okay.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]That does help.[A][N]
Thank you, Sam.[A][N]
Again, it's just been[...][N]
a lot, lately.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] I've noticed.[A][N]
[...]Whatever it is you[N]
think of yourself[...][A][N]
You're why we've come far.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...]Thanks.[A][X]

##C23_Bechamel_Hollandaise_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBechamel][OpenMidRight][LoadHollandaise]
Gotta say, brother[...][n]
They're all fools.[A][N]
This whole lot.[N]
'ow're they alive?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't follow. This army's[N]
mighty bright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They're got no self-preservation.[N]
Throwin' themselves into fights.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ye do that all the time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Because I can beat the crap[N]
out o' anyone and everyone![A][N]
[...]At least from those brainless[N]
Lowlander thugs.[A][N]
Look, I'm just sayin' I'd cut[N]
my losses wit' all this war.[A][N]
Pack up, run, hide.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]The odds're stacked. But tha'[N]
just makes it more thrillin'.[A][N]
An' this means more than scrappin'[N]
for food or loot at home.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
More enough to throw away[N]
our lives?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Then go.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Not without ye.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Oof. Then we be stuck[N]
'ere together, sis.[A][N]
These buckos are me mateys.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Yer lucky I love[N]
ya, bro.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Aye. I am.[A][X]

##C23_Butch_Jeff_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadButch][OpenMidRight][LoadJeff][OpenMidLeft]
Heya, Jeff. Still stuck[N]
on what I said?[A][N]
[...]If so, that's a little sad.[N]
It's been what, a month?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't mock me. Introspection's[N]
a bitch of a time.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Fair.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]How do you do it?[N]
How do you just change?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I stop doin' one thing.[N]
I start doin' another.[A][N]
Doesn't have to be anything[N]
more complicated.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It[...] can't be that simple.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's the thing. It is.[A][N]
Sure, that may not sort out[N]
all your feelings.[A][N]
But that's what the rest of[N]
your life is for.[A][N]
Actually changin's easy.[A][N]
[...]You just tell yourself it ain't[N]
so you don't gotta feel bad.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I won't pretend to know your[N]
life's story.[A] What kind of[N]
wrongs you've done.[A][N]
I just know that I've seen[N]
even the worst people change.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]Hmph. [...]Thanks.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Not a problem, bud.[A][X]

##C23_Leila_Zacharias_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZacharias][OpenMidRight][LoadLeila]
[...]Hey.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Nothing, really. Just thought[N]
I'd come by.[A][N]
I know you're not a fan of it,[N]
but I like talking to you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
At least you're honest about it.[A][N]
No uncomfortably dodging questions.[N]
No pretenses of sincerity.[A][N]
Just a rude brick wall.[A][N]
[...]The way I like it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Are you quite finished?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
See? Like that. It's comforting.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're still quite strange.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad we have no illusions[N]
about each other.[A][X]

##C23_Avan_Ptolemy_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPtolemy][OpenMidRight][LoadAvan][ToggleSmile]
Well, hello, there! You're[N]
Ptolemy, correct?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's right. What do you[N]
require of me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You like bees, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I'd say.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excellent! I was just wondering[...][A][N]
I wish to plant some flowers.[N]
Which ones do they like most?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] That's a toughie.[A][N]
They tend to adapt to what's[N]
naturally around them.[A][N]
Bees from Mevion'll like plants[N]
from Mevion,[A] bees from Holanis[N]
like Holanian foliage, and so on.[A][N]
If you're planning on planting[N]
some here,[A] you could see what's[N]
natural in this area.[A][N]
Of course, you could also plant[N]
something from far away.[A][N]
I like to imagine that they enjoy[N]
seeing something new to pollinate.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That all makes sense to me.[A][N]
Hm[...] In that case, I think[N]
I'll go with these seeds[...][A][N]
And as a treat, this one I've[N]
kept around from Elba Cor.[A][N]
If I remember correctly, it'll[N]
become a beautiful white rose.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That sounds lovely. I'll have to come[N]
back here someday. See how it looks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ha! That could be fun.[A][X]

##C23_Desmond_Mikey_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDesmond][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadMikey][OpenMidLeft]
[...]This is[...] unexpected.[A][N]
To think Tarquin would[N]
turn on Aercolyn.[A][N][OpenEyes]
And he's using Yg'stra's[N]
might to enforce his will.[A][N]
I'm truly sorry, Mikey.[A][N]
An affront to your nation,[N]
in front of your eyes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's hardly your fault, Desmond.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Still, pointless war brings me[N]
no happiness.[A] Especially against[N]
a foe as daunting as them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's why we keep fighting.[A][N]
Trust me. I want nothing more than[N]
to go home and never fight again.[A][N]
But I couldn't now. Not even if[N]
it were a realistic option.[A][N]
Something within me is telling[N]
me to make right of Yg'stra.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I think what you've done for us[N]
is service enough for a life.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Maybe it is. Still[...][A][N]
Can't help this nagging feeling.[A][N]
That I owe Yg'stra something more.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I understand that feeling well.[N]
Just[...] Don't let it consume you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'll do my best, sir.[A][X]

##C23_Father_Select
Sins of the Father[X]

##C23_Father_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKenneth][OpenMidRight][LoadBlair]
[...]I'm sorry about your father, Kenneth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]What're you apologizing for?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]You know we're probably going[N]
to have to strike him down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Okay. [...]Anything else?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're fine with this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Obviously, I'd prefer not to.[N]
But we're long past that.[A][N]
If he shall bow to the whims of[N]
Arbordia,[A] then he has made an[N]
enemy of all of us.[A][N][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]He's my responsibility.[A][N]
I can understand you not wanting the[N]
two of us to fight.[A][N]
[...]But if I am to succeed him,[N]
I must prove myself to him.[A][N]
Even if through his blood.[A][N][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
[...]If you're certain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]The way I see it, blood's just that.[N]
Blood. Nothing special to it.[A][N]
You all have spent your life working[N]
to earn my trust. My respect.[A][N]
[...]He hasn't.[A][N]
[...]I know not your feelings on[N]
your own father.[A][N]
But I hope you can understand mine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Alright, Kenneth.[N]
Still[...] I'm sorry.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't be. History will[...][N]
look fondly on us.[A][X]
