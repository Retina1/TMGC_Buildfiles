[...]Brother[...] Is that you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
[...]Samantha. I presume you[N]
understand why I'm here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]I'd[...] rather not fight you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, well. Arbordia willed it so.[N]
And this is Barford's chance.[A][N]
Every one of your siblings has[N]
