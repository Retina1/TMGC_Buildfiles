Ah, Peggy! I've been meaning to[N]
ask about this friend of yours.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]The name's Butch. Peggy and I go[N]
way back. Call us... war buddies.[A][N]
[OpenRight]I'd more say acquaintances.[A][N]
Buddies wouldn't wait twelve years[N]
to see each other again.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]In my defense, you traveled quite[N]
a bit after the revolution.[A][N]
Probably couldn't have found you[N]
even if I tried.[A][N]
In any case, I'm here to stay.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Even though we've fought against[N]
the Mevionese several times now?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Peggy reminded me of what's important.[N]
While country is obviously a worthy cause...[A][N]
Fighting for people you trust is[N]
far more important.[A][N]
Besides, I'll admit that the Mevs aren't[N]
quite what they used to be.[A][N]
Way more... vicious than I had remembered.[N]
You might've met a man named Marque.[A][N]
I served under him for a time.[N]
More corrupt than the final king.[A][N]
Even Mitchell, the last man I served,[N]
turned a blind eye to brutality.[A][N]
For this country to be better, I have[N]
to start by changing myself.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Lovely speech there.[N]
He also owes me for saving his life.[A][N]
So even if he wanted to leave,[N]
I'd just hold that over him.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...[A][N]
[OpenRight]Ah, fine. I'm glad to have you back.[N]
Know what? Take this as proof of that.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]...Did you steal this from your church?[A][N]
[OpenRight]If they find you with it, you have[N]
no idea who I am.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Ha, well then.[N]
Good talking to you, Blair.[A][N]
Glad to see I'm working for[N]
a noble spirit for once.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Sir Butch.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Nah, just Butch.[A][N]
[OpenRight]...Keep calling him sir.[N]
It'll be funny.[A][X]

##C6_Elba_Cor
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenRight][LoadRachael][OpenFarRight][LoadCassius][OpenMidLeft]
Is there anything more about[N]
Elba Cor I should know?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]I think you got most of it.[A][N]
I mean... Guess I could introduce[N]
some important names.[A][N]
Though there's really not many[N]
that'll be important to you.[A][N]
[OpenRight]Besides our king, I'd imagine you'll run[N]
into Commander Hyperius.[A][N]
He's the captain of the royal guard,[N]
and may as well be our army's commander.[A][N]
One may say he's a paragon of knighthood.[N]
Unsurprising, given his forty year tenure.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Forty years of putting up with this...[N]
I'd have gone absolutely mad.[A][N]
[OpenRight]...Anyway. To be frank, he's had[N]
his doubts about you,[A] but I'm sure[N]
you'll be able to prove yourself.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]Relax, Rachael. The man's a softie.[N]
Blair'll be fine.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Anything else?[A][N]
[OpenRight]...[A][N]
Well...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]We've... got mountains...?[N]
Look, there's not a ton to say.[A][N]
Serving the crown's an exhaustive job.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Have you ever taken a break?[A][N]
[OpenRight]This man spent twelve hours hidden[N]
behind a throne for a dramatic reveal.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I... see.[A][N]
While I'm glad you two are dedicated,[N]
please don't push yourselves too hard.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]No promises! Taking things to comical[N]
absurds is the Cassius style.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...Well, then.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPeggy][OpenMidRight][LoadNatasia]
Hey, Peggy![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]No need to be so loud.[N]
I'm right here.[A][N]
What do you want?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]I noticed your staff handiwork,[N]
and I've been wondering-[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Sorry, I don't teach healing.[A][N]
Most of my training was relatively[N]
informal during the revolution.[A][N]
I wouldn't hear the end of it if[N]
I taught you,[A] and you accidentally[N]
fused someone's eyelids together.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, healing? No, not what I meant.[N]
I meant your... bonking?[A] Is that[N]
what I'm calling it?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Bonk's a good word.[N]
Satisfying ring to it.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Anyway, it seems just like swinging an axe,[N]
so I thought I could give ya' some pointers![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]I see, I see... That sounds[N]
quite interesting.[A][N]
I'll take you up on that.[A][N]
Sorry for tearing into you earlier,[N]
by the way.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, it's nothing. Anyway, let's begin.[N]
Start by hitting me hard as you can![A][X]

##C6_Sam_Josef_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSam][OpenMidRight][LoadJosef]
Lady Sam! I believe we got off[N]
on the wrong foot a while ago.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh... You mean when you ran off ahead[N]
of me at the Yg'stran outpost?[A][N]
It's... alright. Your intentions[N]
were in the right place.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Hardly! For me to abandon a[N]
comrade like that...[N]
Just to secure an offensive[N]
position...[A][N]
It's truly unthinkable![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...It's my fault for being too slow.[N]
And for holding you back...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]You're young, and new to combat.[N]
Of course you'd feel that way.[A][N]
But eventually, you'll come into your own.[N]
Until then, don't look down on yourself.[A][N]
Besides, just look at me. Hardly a shame[N]
to fall short of a brilliant knight.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]You're very... kind? I think?[N]
I'll... try to better myself.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent! If you ever need a target[N]
for practice, just find my shining armor.[A][N]
I'll endure whatever it takes to[N]
better our army![A][N]
...Just don't aim for the head.[N]
Please.[A][X]

##C6_Blair_Kenneth_Base
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBlair][OpenMidRight][LoadKenneth]
Ah, Blair. Good to see you well.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Same here, Kenneth.[A] ...Say, what[N]
do you make of all this?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]All this? What precisely do you mean?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]Of Elba Cor. Of the king wanting...[N]
me, of all people.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...Do you want the answer that makes[N]
you feel better about yourself,[A][N]
or the purely rational answer?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...The rational answer... I think?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Given Aercolyn's location and current[N]
status within the Dalstian territories,[A][N]
it's not unreasonable to think that Elba[N]
Cor may wish to assimilate Aercolyn.[A][N]
After all, its position outside the Elba Cor[N]
border mountains affords unique benefits,[A][N]
and its relatively central location may[N]
afford the kingdom more political power.[A][N]
Need I go on?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...What about the feel-good answer?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...The king might feel pity for you?[A][N]
Though, even that pity may stem from Yg'stra[N]
taking a territory near Elba Cor's doorstep...[A][N]
Look, I've never been one to shy away from[N]
uncomfortable truths.[A] This may all[N]
just be a step in some grand scheme.[A][N]
That's what I know. How people think.[N]
Not how people feel.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]Of course, this may all be wrong.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]You don't need to doubt your skills[N]
to make me feel better.[A][N]
Besides, if this is all just some game, I'd[N]
feel better with your skills on my side.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]...I'm glad to hear that.[A][X]
